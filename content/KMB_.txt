corporate responsibility and sustainability 

our continued commitment to doing the right thing underpins our social impact and smallest footprint ambitions b etter care for a better world begins with ensuring the health and safety of our customers consumers and employees promoting diversity and inclusion within our business and protecting the rights of workers across our supply chain we also believe we can make meaningful contributions to gender equality clean water and sanitation climate action and responsible consumption and production our sustainability strategy puts our brand supply chain and innovation teams to work to create shared value by solving global challenges and is focused on addressing impactful climaterelated risks and opportunities throughout our value chain as outlined in our most recent task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd report 

we implement this strategy by considering our sustainability goals during our business and capital planning processes aligning the priorities of our supply chain brand and innovation teams and establishing meaningful performance indicators our environmental priorities include reducing our use of new fossil fuelbased plastic while enabling circular systems to recover the materials in our products and packaging reducing our products’ use of natural forest fiber while protecting forest biodiversity and supporting forest dependent communities reducing greenhouse gas emissions along our value chain with goals approved by the science based targets initiative sbti and building resilience to water risk at our facilities and in our communities in waterstressed regions around the world the united nations sustainable development goals are now accepted as the best shared definition of what needs to be done over the next decade and we have aligned our goals with that framework 

regulatory compliance 

we are subject to many laws and regulations across all the countries in which we do business and we are particularly impacted by those relating to product safety environmental protection and data privacy and protection 

we are obligated to comply with regulations that cover product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting these include requirements that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers of risks of using our products in some cases it may be necessary to initiate product recalls if safety risks are considered to exist all our facilities and other operations are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater we are also subject to various laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection including the european union’s general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which became effective on january 1 2020 



our policy is to abide by all applicable laws and regulations and we have internal programs in place to manage global compliance with these various requirements we monitor each of these areas for new or changed regulatory requirements particularly in the rapidly evolving area of data privacy and protection we have made and plan to continue making necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations however total capital expenditures and operating expenses related to compliance are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures consolidated earnings or competitive position 

human capital management 

we had approximately 45000 employees as of december 31 2021 in our consolidated operations approximately 30 percent of our employees were located in north america and the remainder were in approximately 60 countries outside of north america overall approximately 60 percent of our workforce was directly involved in manufacturing and distribution operations 

in order to recruit retain develop protect and fairly compensate our employees we focus on four key areas inclusion and diversity health and safety development and employee engagement and compensation and benefits 

• inclusion and diversity – we believe our business success is intricately tied to creating workplaces communities and experiences where inclusion and diversity are evident and thriving we prioritize the need to cultivate a workforce where all are included and empowered to do their best work employing people from disparate backgrounds cultures and experiences amplifies our ability to gather insights foster innovation and understand the culture context and mindset of consumers around the world as a company who serves consumers and communities it is essential that our workforce is comprised of people who look think and behave like the people who use our products – now and in the future as such we support workforce inclusion and diversity and consider it a fundamental business strategy we continue to make progress on our shortand longterm goals for women and us people of color in all management roles this commitment is evidenced by having the management development and compensation committee “mdc” of the board of directors responsible for reviewing the diversity and inclusion strategy and related metrics 

• health and safety – we are committed to the health and safety of our employees we create and administer companywide policies and processes to protect our employees and to comply with applicable safety regulations health and safety training is regularly provided to our employees we review and monitor our performance closely to drive continuous improvement in our safety programs 

in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic we provided enhanced benefits and implemented additional workplace safety programs and processes in all our facilities as the circumstances and impacts of covid19 evolve we continue to evaluate our response and adapt to protect the health and safety of our employees 

• development and employee engagement – developing talent and leaders at all levels of the organization and engaging our employees is critical to our longterm success we maintain talent and succession planning processes and have leadership and management development programs as well as broad learning opportunities for all employees to support their career growth and advance their skills 

we also offer employees the opportunity to join employee resource groups ergs these groups foster professional development social connectivity and celebrate diversity throughout our company current ergs provide community and insights into the perspectives and experiences of those with african hispanic latino and asian ancestry women and lgbtq as well as parents caregivers people with disabilities military veterans and new employees our ergs promote career development by allowing employees to connect with and learn from one another and help amplify our inclusion and diversity efforts 

further in regard to employee engagement we hold regular town hall meetings where any employee can ask questions of executives and make their voice heard we also host global conversations about racism bias and other important topics we engage in continuous listening via global surveys on an ongoing basis that offer our employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential issues and identify opportunities to improve and support employee engagement 

• compensation and benefits – we provide marketbased competitive compensation through our salary annual incentive and longterm incentive programs and robust benefits packages that promote employee wellbeing across all aspects of 



their lives eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to our goals with both shortterm cash incentives and longterm equitybased incentives we also provide a variety of resources and services to help our employees plan for retirement we believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract retain and motivate our employees 

the mdc is responsible for establishing and administering the policies governing annual compensation and longterm compensation to ensure that the policies are designed to align compensation with our overall business strategy and performance

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

business operations 

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks which may have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks the ongoing covid19 pandemic could have negative impacts on our business including causing significant volatility in demand for our products changes in consumer behavior and preference disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain operations disruptions to our cost saving programs limitations on our employees’ ability to work and travel significant changes in the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate and related currency and commodity volatility despite our efforts to manage these impacts their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any such outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects 

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could disrupt our business operations and cause us financial and reputational damage 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data such as the general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer supplier employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event or any failure to comply with these data privacy requirements or other laws in this area could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability or regulatory or other penalties in addition we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks the risk of cyberbased attacks is heightened with many of our employees working and accessing our 



technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are in the process of upgrading our enterprise resource planning system known as sap to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations the upgrade poses several challenges including training of personnel communication of new rules and procedures migration of data and the potential instability of the new system moreover there is no assurance that the new system will meet our current and future business needs or that it will operate as designed any significant failure or delay in the system upgrade could cause an interruption to our business and adversely affect our operations and financial results 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation or other necessary supplies or services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in past years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices in some instances we utilize negotiated shortterm contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products and disposable wipes contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources 

there can be no assurance that our efforts to minimize the impact of increased costs including increasing selling prices in response to the increased costs will be successful 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

our strategy includes operations growth outside the us especially in developing markets such as china eastern europe asean and latin america about half of our net sales come from markets outside the us we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 33 countries and sell products in a substantial majority of countries around the world our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks 

• exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the us dollar a portion of the exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies is systematically managed through 



foreign currency forward and swap contracts where available and economically advantageous we do not generally hedge our income statement translation exposure with respect to foreign operations 

• increases in currency exchange restrictions these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the us or obtain currency exchange for us dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries 

• adverse political conditions risks related to political instability expropriation new or revised legal or regulatory constraints difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights and potentially adverse tax consequences could adversely affect our financial results 

• increases in dollarbased input costs for operations outside the us due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

• greater economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions 

the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina 

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management inclusion and diversity human rights and other sustainability or similar matters or breaches of consumer customer supplier employee or other confidential information real or perceived could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer in addition our products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity potentially with negative perception of our products or brands our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products 

disruption in our supply chain or our manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business  

our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism epidemics pandemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our suppliers employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 



we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties including our acquisition of softex indonesia in october 2020 acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

we may periodically divest product lines or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses furthermore the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations including by enhancing our competitors positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products 

the inability to effectively and efficiently manage acquisitions and divestitures with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

climate change and other sustainability matters may adversely affect our business and operations 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters we have transition risk where we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water and other raw materials as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations moreover we have physical risk where natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain in addition concern over climate change may result in new legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment despite our sustainability efforts any failure to achieve our sustainability goals including those aimed to reduce our impact on improve or preserve the environment or the perception whether or not valid that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could adversely affect our business and reputation 

there is also increased focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations investors customers consumers our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters including responsible sourcing and deforestation the use of plastic energy and water the recyclability or recoverability of packaging including singleuse and other plastic packaging and ingredient transparency our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters which could adversely affect our business 

marketing and competition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and etailers with the consolidation of retail trade both traditional retailers and etailers we are increasingly dependent on key customers and some of these customers including largeformat retailers and large etailers may have significant bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

intense competition for sales of our products changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels a growing ecommerce marketplace and customers and competitors actions our competitors for these markets include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater 



market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price ecommerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results in order to stay competitive it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions which could adversely affect our financial results 

we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products demand for our products may change based on many factors including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as privatelabel products and mid to lowertier value products low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors negative customer or consumer response to pricing actions consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to etailers subscription services and direct to consumer businesses changing consumer preferences due to increased concerns in regard to postconsumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability or other changes in consumer trends or habits if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products also if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights we may be less competitive which could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 

legal and regulatory 

government regulations and enforcement and potential litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including laws and regulations involving marketing antitrust antibribery or anticorruption product liability environmental intellectual property or other matters as well as potential litigation or administrative actions 

if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image 

in addition new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business which could adversely impact our financial results for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials 

new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied some jurisdictions have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations

we are subject to risks and uncertainties which can affect our business operations and financial results see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k for additional information 

business environment and trends 

our results of operations have been and we expect them to continue to be affected by the following factors and key trends which may cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical results discussed under “results of operations and related information” 

covid19  the macro business environment experienced unprecedented volatility in 2021 related to the continuing effect the global covid19 pandemic has had on supply and demand dynamics 

we participate in fixed consumption categories where demand is generally very stable over the last two years our sales have fluctuated especially in consumer tissue and kc professional because of covid19related demand spikes inventory destocking and consumer usage pattern disruption additionally consumer incomes have been negatively impacted by the pandemic leading to lower usage tradedown on price tiers and slower entry into some of our categories covid19 outbreaks and patterns are difficult to predict and therefore volatility of demand for our products may continue in the near term 

the pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains across the globe a steep drop in aggregate demand at the beginning of the pandemic caused aggregate supply to sharply contract when demand for goods resumed at the end of 2020 supply shortages led to record levels of inflation in commodities and other costs in addition to inflation logistics and distribution networks especially in the us have been severely impacted by container and truck shortages and significant labor supply issues these effects have caused challenges getting input materials into our production facilities production delays and delays and meaningfully higher costs to get products from our production facilities to our customers the net effect of the global supply chain disruption led to an unprecedented increase in costs in 2021 the underlying causes of the disruption and higher costs will take time to be resolved 

birth rate trends  sales of our baby and child care products are highly correlated with birth rate trends in recent years birth rate declines in key countries including china south korea russia and the us have pressured category volume growth rates to help mitigate the effects of birth rate declines we aim to drive sales growth at or ahead of category growth rates through innovation premiumization strong brand building plans and digital marketing investment as part of our elevate and expand growth strategy 

competition  our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace our competitors include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers which offer products that are typically sold at lower prices in particular private label market share has been increasing in the tissue category increased purchases of private label products could reduce net sales of our highermargin products which would negatively impact our profitability while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive we continue to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and etailers this market environment has resulted in increased pressure on pricing and other competitive factors and we expect these pressures to continue in the coming year 

pricing  our net sales growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address market conditions we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment technological improvements and changes in our raw material distribution energy and other input costs we increased our prices in 2021 in response to record inflation related to the covid19 pandemic in 2022 we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing price changes may affect net sales earnings and market share in the near term as the market adjusts to new pricing and other market conditions 



operating costs  our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs and pricing actions to remain competitive on our operating structure we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability such as our force program in 2021 our results were impacted by an unprecedented increase in our costs particularly for pulp resin distribution and energy primarily related to covid19 pandemic driven effects we expect the higher cost environment will continue in 2022 

evolving consumer product and shopping preferences  the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve due to the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers changing consumer preferences as consumers increasingly shop online and the increased presence of alternative retail channels such as subscription services and directtoconsumer businesses changing consumer preferences also include increased concerns in regard to postconsumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease we believe our strategic growth focus sustainability initiatives and continued investment in ecommerce capabilities has us well positioned relative to these changing dynamics 

volatility of global markets  our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations including in de markets some de markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions volatility in these markets affects our production costs and the demand for our products volatility in global consumer commodity and foreign currency exchange rates increased significantly during 2021 and is expected to continue in the near term 

climate change  we operate in many regions around the world where our businesses could be disrupted by climate change our climate change risk categories include risks related to the transition to a lowercarbon economy “transition risks” and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change “physical risks” transition risks include increased costs of raw materials increased cost of capital shifts in customerconsumer values and other legal regulatory and technological risks physical risks include the risk of direct damage to assets or supply chain disruption caused by severe weather events such as floods storms wildfires and droughts we continue to progress toward our 2030 sustainability goals which include elements that aim for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions use of natural forest fibers use of plastics and use of water in waterstressed regions

2018 global restructuring program 

in 2018 we initiated our 2018 global restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization the restructuring actions were completed in 2021 we closed or sold 11 manufacturing facilities and expanded production capacity at several others we exited or divested some lowermargin businesses that generated approximately 1 percent of our net sales workforce reductions were approximately 6000 the restructuring impacted all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies savings from this initiative were 140 in 2021 bringing cumulative annual savings to 560 versus the 2017 baseline see item 8 note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by operations was 27 billion in 2021 compared to 37 billion in 2020 the decrease was driven by lower earnings and less cash provided by working capital 



obligations 

the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable   



• the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials primarily superabsorbent materials pulp and utilities although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows we believe exposure to losses if any under these arrangements is not material 

• the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery 

the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain the following payments are not included in the table 

• we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately 25 to these plans in 2022 

• other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions including expected future service to project the future obligations based upon those projections we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately 55 through 2031 

• accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests 

investing 

our capital spending was 10 billion in 2021 and 12 billion in 2020  including incremental spending related to the 2018 global restructuring program acquisition net of cash acquired of 11 billion in 2020 reflected the purchase of softex indonesia we expect capital spending to be approximately 10 billion to 11 billion in 2022 

financing 

we issue longterm debt in the public market periodically proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness see item 8 note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details 

our shortterm debt which consists of us commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days andor other similar shortterm debt issued by nonus subsidiaries was 118 as of december 31 2021 included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet the average monthend balance of shortterm debt for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 was 10 billion these shortterm borrowings provide supplemental funding to support our operations the level of shortterm debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions dividends and income taxes 

at december 31 2021 total debt was 86 billion compared to 84 billion at december 31 2020 

we maintain a 20 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2026 and a 750 revolving credit facility which expires in june 2022 these facilities currently unused support our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” is in the process of phasing out libor with completion of the phase out expected by june 30 2023 we have evaluated the potential 



effect of the elimination of libor and do not expect the effect to be material accounting guidance has been issued to ease the transition to alternative reference rates from a financial reporting perspective see item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for details 

we paid 15 billion in dividends in 2021 the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 18 percent for 2022 we repurchase shares of kimberlyclark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs during 2021 we repurchased 30 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 400 through a broker in the open market we are targeting fullyear 2022 share repurchases of approximately 100 subject to market conditions 

we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending pension contributions dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall business liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments and goodwill and other intangible assets these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs generally the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee postretirement benefits 

substantially all regular employees in the us and the united kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain us and united kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit the principal plans certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8 note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations 

• longterm rate of return on plan assets  the expected longterm rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis in setting these assumptions we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate 

as of december 31 2021 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 10 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  if the expected 



longterm rate of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2022  

• discount rate  the discount or settlement rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligation at december 31 2021 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan for the united kingdom plan the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2022 and the december 31 2021 pension liability would increase by about 111 

• other assumptions  there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections 

pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 50 i n 2022 pension expense beyond 2022 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate 

• discount rate  the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that countrys pension obligation if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent the impact to 2022 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31 2021 benefit liability would not be material 

• health care cost trend rate  the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace 

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the us and uncertain tax positions our income tax related accounting policies account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8 note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

• deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances  we have recorded deferred tax assets related to among other matters income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

• undistributed earnings  as of dec ember 31 2021 we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately 78 billion earnings of 44 billion were previously subject to tax primarily due to the onetime transition tax on foreign earnings required by the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act any additional taxes due with respect to such previouslytaxed earnings if repatriated would generally be limited to foreign and us state income taxes deferred taxes have been recorded on 08 billion o f earnings most of which were previously taxed for us federal income tax purposes of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated we do not intend to distribute the remain ing 36 billion of previously taxed foreign earnings and 



therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and us state income taxes on such earnings we consider any excess to be indefinitely reinvested the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the 36 billion of previously taxed foreign earnings is not practicable 

• uncertain tax positions  we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in our income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives generally ranging from 10 to 20 years we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists to measure the acquisition date fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired 

events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

our related accounting policies acquisition of softex indonesia and goodwill and other intangible assets account balances are discussed in item 8 notes 1 3 and 4 respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry and competitive conditions legal and regulatory environments historical and projected financial performance significant changes in the reporting unit and the magnitude of excess fair value over carrying amount from the previous quantitative impairment testing if the result of a qualitative test indicates a potential for impairment a quantitative test is performed when a quantitative test is considered necessary estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model and a marketbased approach we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and earnings the other key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow include but are not limited to discount rates actual business trends experienced commodity prices foreign exchange rates inflation and terminal growth rates 

for 2021 we completed the required annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment as of the first day of the third quarter and we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeds the carrying amount for each of our reporting units 

other intangible assets 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model and a marketbased approach using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate the cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model are consistent with those we use in our internal planning which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced and the longterm business strategy 

we performed our 2021 impairment assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the third quarter and based upon a qualitative assessment no impairment indicators were found to be present 



new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements 

information concerning forwardlooking statements 

certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook including raw material energy and other input costs the anticipated cost savings from our force program cash flow and uses of cash growth initiatives innovations marketing and other spending net sales anticipated currency rates and exchange risks including the impact in argentina effective tax rate contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberlyclark including dividends share repurchases and pension contributions constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberlyclark there can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them 

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside our control including pandemics including the ongoing covid19 outbreak and the related responses of governments consumers customers suppliers and employees epidemics fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the prices and availability of our raw materials supply chain disruptions due to covid19 changes in customer preferences severe weather conditions and government trade or similar regulatory actions potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products energy costs general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business as well as our ability to maintain key customer relationships and to realize the expected benefits and synergies of the softex indonesia acquisition could affect the realization of these estimates 

the factors described under item 1a risk factors in this form 10k or in our other sec filings among others could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 



presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed through the systematic use of foreign currency forward contracts the use of these instruments supports the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part gains or losses on the underlying foreign currency exposure we also utilize cross currency swaps and foreign denominated debt to hedge certain investments in foreign subsidiaries the gain or loss on these instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income to offset the change in value of the net investments being hedged 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 

as of december 31 2021 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31 2021 rates and the assumed rates 

our operations in argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of an argentine peso versus the us dollar applied to our net peso monetary position are recorded in other income and expense net at the time of the change as of december 31 2021 kc argentina had a small net peso monetary position and a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not be material 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2021 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 750 in the view of management the above potential uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2021 the longterm debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixedrate debt f rom time to time we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt and those contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 

in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixedrate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments at december 31 2021 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 224 which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value 



commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp and petroleumbased materials selling prices of products are influenced in part by the market price for these pulp and petroleumbased materials as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp or petroleumbased material prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in commodity prices in some instances we use contracts of varying durations along with strategic pricing mechanisms to manage volatility for a portion of our commodity costs but derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

regulatory compliance 

we are subject to many laws and regulations across all the countries in which we do business and we are particularly impacted by those relating to product safety environmental protection and data privacy and protection 

we are obligated to comply with regulations that cover product safety efficacy manufacturing advertising labeling and safety reporting these include requirements that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers of risks of using our products in some cases it may be necessary to initiate product recalls if safety risks are considered to exist all our facilities and other operations are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater we are also subject to various laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection including the european union’s general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which became effective on january 1 2020

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

business operations 

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks which may have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks the ongoing covid19 pandemic could have negative impacts on our business including causing significant volatility in demand for our products changes in consumer behavior and preference disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain operations disruptions to our cost saving programs and restructuring initiatives limitations on our employees’ ability to work and travel significant changes in the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate and related currency and commodity volatility despite our efforts to manage these impacts their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any such outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects 

cyberattacks privacy breaches data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could disrupt our business operations and cause us financial and reputational damage 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data such as the general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer supplier employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event or any failure to comply with these data privacy requirements or other laws in this area could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability or regulatory or other penalties in addition we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 



our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks the risk of cyberbased attacks is heightened with many of our employees working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation or other necessary supplies or services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in past years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices in some instances we utilize negotiated shortterm contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products and disposable wipes contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources 

there can be no assurance that our efforts to increase selling prices in response to increased costs will be successful 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

our strategy includes operations growth outside the us especially in developing markets such as china eastern europe asean and latin america about half of our net sales come from markets outside the us we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 34 countries and sell products in a substantial majority of countries around the world our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks 

• exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the us dollar a portion of the exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts where available and economically advantageous we do not generally hedge our income statement translation exposure with respect to foreign operations 

• increases in currency exchange restrictions these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the us or obtain currency exchange for us dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries 

• adverse political conditions risks related to political instability expropriation new or revised legal or regulatory constraints difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights and potentially adverse tax 



consequences including the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union brexit and the related ongoing negotiations with the european union could adversely affect our financial results 

• increases in dollarbased input costs for operations outside the us due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina 

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management inclusion and diversity human rights and other sustainability or similar matters or breaches of consumer customer supplier employee or other confidential information real or perceived could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer in addition our products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity potentially with negative perception of our products or brands our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products 

disruption in our supply chain or our manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business  

our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism epidemics pandemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our suppliers employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist in january 2018 we announced a global restructuring program the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties including our recent acquisition of softex indonesia acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 



we may periodically divest product lines or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses furthermore the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations including by enhancing our competitors positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products 

the inability to effectively and efficiently manage acquisitions and divestitures with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

marketing and competition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and etailers with the consolidation of retail trade both traditional retailers and etailers we are increasingly dependent on key customers and some of these customers including largeformat retailers and large etailers may have significant bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

intense competition for sales of our products changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels a growing ecommerce marketplace and customers and competitors actions our competitors for these markets include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price ecommerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions which could adversely affect our financial results 

we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products demand for our products may change based on many factors including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as privatelabel products and mid to lowertier value products low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors negative consumer response to pricing actions consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to etailers changing consumer preferences due to increased concerns in regard to postconsumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability or other changes in consumer trends or habits if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products also if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights we may be less competitive which could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 



legal and regulatory 

government regulations and enforcement and potential litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including laws and regulations involving marketing antitrust antibribery or anticorruption product liability environmental intellectual property or other matters as well as potential litigation or administrative actions 

if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image 

in addition new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business including in connection with brexit which could adversely impact our financial results for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials 

new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies including tax reform in the us that was enacted in december 2017 other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations

we have experienced increased volatility in demand for some of our products as consumers adapt to the evolving environment beginning in the first quarter of 2020 particularly in march demand increased in our consumer tissue and personal care business segments across all major geographies as consumers increased home inventory levels in response to covid19 the increase was followed by a period of demand softness as consumers used existing home inventories and demand returned to more normal levels demand for our consumer tissue products was elevated throughout 2020 as more people spent more time at home our kc professional business experienced volume declines throughout 2020 reflecting the reduction in away from home demand 

during 2020 we experienced temporary closures of certain facilities though we did not experience a material impact from a plant closure and our facilities were largely exempt or partially exempt from government closure orders at many of our facilities we have been experiencing increased employee absences which may continue in the current situation

• we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately 50 to these plans in 2021 

• other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions including expected future service to project the future obligations based upon those projections we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately 50 through 2030 

• accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests 

investing 

our capital spending was 12 billion in 2020 and 2019  including incremental spending related to the 2018 global restructuring program acquisition net of cash acquired of 11 billion in 2020 reflected the purchase of softex indonesia 



proceeds from dispositions of property in 2019 of 242 primarily reflects the proceeds from the sales of manufacturing facilities and associated real estate related to the 2018 global restructuring program and property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring we expect capital spending to be approximately 12 billion to 13 billion in 2021 including spending associated with the 2018 global restructuring program and other growth initiatives 

financing 

we issue longterm debt in the public market periodically proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness see item 8 note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for details 

our shortterm debt which consists of us commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days andor other similar shortterm debt issued by nonus subsidiaries was 223 as of december 31 2020 included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet the average monthend balance of shortterm debt for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 was 365 these shortterm borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations the level of shortterm debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions dividends and income taxes 

at december 31 2020 total debt was 84 billion compared to 77 billion at december 31 2019 

we maintain a 20 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2023 and a 750 revolving credit facility which expires in june 2021 these facilities currently unused support our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason 

in july 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the eventual replacement of the libor but we do not expect the effect to be material accounting guidance has been issued to ease the transition to alternative reference rates from a financial reporting perspective see item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for details 

we paid 15 billion in dividends in 2020 the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 65 percent for 2021 we repurchase shares of kimberlyclark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs during 2020 we repurchased 49 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 700 through a broker in the open market we are targeting fullyear 2021 share repurchases between 650 and 750 subject to market conditions on january 22 2021 the corporation’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program pursuant to which the corporation is authorized to repurchase up to 40 million shares of the corporation’s common stock subject to a limit of 5 billion in aggregate expenditures the authorization is incremental to the remaining shares available to be repurchased under the current share repurchase program authorized on november 13 2014 

we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital payments for our 2018 global restructuring program capital spending pension contributions dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall business liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 



critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs generally the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee postretirement benefits 

substantially all regular employees in the us and the united kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain us and united kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit the principal plans certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8 note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations 

• longterm rate of return on plan assets  the expected longterm rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis in setting these assumptions we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate 

as of december 31 2020 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 11 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2021 

• discount rate  the discount or settlement rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligation at december 31 2020 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan for the united kingdom plan the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2021 and the december 31 2020 pension liability would increase by about 146 

• other assumptions  there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections 



pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 85 in 2021 including incremental charges resulting from 2018 global restructuring program actions pension expense beyond 2021 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate 

• discount rate  the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that countrys pension obligation if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent the impact to 2021 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31 2020 benefit liability would not be material 

• health care cost trend rate  the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace 

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the us and uncertain tax positions our income tax related accounting policies account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8 note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

• deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances  we have recorded deferred tax assets related to among other matters income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

• undistributed earnings  as of december 31 2020 we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately 79 billion earnings of 52 billion were previously subject to tax primarily due to the onetime transition tax on foreign earnings required by the tax cuts and jobs act any additional taxes due with respect to such previouslytaxed earnings if repatriated would generally be limited to foreign and us state income taxes deferred taxes have been recorded on 07 billion of earnings most of which were previously taxed for us federal income tax purposes of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated we do not intend to distribute the remaining 45 billion of previously taxed foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and us state income taxes on such earnings while the transition tax resulted in a reduction of the excess amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries any remaining amount of financial reporting over tax basis after such reduction could be subject to additional taxes if repatriated however we consider any excess to be indefinitely reinvested the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the 45 billion of previously taxed foreign earn ings is not practicable 

• uncertain tax positions  we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in our income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations 



goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives generally ranging from 10 to 20 years we typically obtain the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists to measure the acquisition date fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired 

events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

our related accounting policies and our acquisition of softex indonesia are discussed in item 8 notes 1 and 3 respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry and competitive conditions legal and regulatory environments historical and projected financial performance significant changes in the reporting unit and the magnitude of excess fair value over carrying amount from the previous quantitative impairment testing if the result of a qualitative test indicates a potential for impairment a quantitative test is performed when a quantitative test is considered necessary estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model and a marketbased approach we use inputs from our longrange planning process to determine growth rates for sales and earnings the other key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow include but are not limited to discount rates actual business trends experienced commodity prices foreign exchange rates inflation and terminal growth rates 

for 2020 we completed the required annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment as of the first day of the third quarter and we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than the carrying amount for each of our reporting units 

other intangible assets 

we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets primarily brands to determine if they are finite or indefinitelived reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence demand competition other economic factors such as the stability of the industry known technological advances and expected changes in distribution channels the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 

our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model and a marketbased approach using inputs which include projected revenues from our longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands and a discount rate the cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model are consistent with those we use in our internal planning which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced and the longterm business strategy 

we performed our 2020 impairment assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the third quarter of 2020 and based upon a qualitative assessment no impairment indicators were found to be present 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements 

information concerning forwardlooking statements 

certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook including the anticipated cost savings from our force program costs and savings from the 2018 global restructuring program cash flow and uses of cash growth initiatives innovations marketing and other spending net sales anticipated currency rates and exchange risks including the impact in argentina raw material energy and other input costs effective tax rate contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberlyclark including dividends share repurchases and pension contributions constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and 



beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberlyclark there can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them 

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside our control including pandemics including the ongoing covid19 outbreak epidemics fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the prices and availability of our raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products energy costs general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business as well as our ability to maintain key customer relationships and to realize the expected benefits and synergies of the softex indonesia acquisition could affect the realization of these estimates 

the factors described under item 1a risk factors in this form 10k or in our other sec filings among others could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed through the systematic use of foreign currency forward contracts the use of these instruments supports the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part gains or losses on the underlying foreign currency exposure we also utilize cross currency swaps and foreign denominated debt to hedge certain investments in foreign subsidiaries the gain or loss on these instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income to offset the change in value of the net investments being hedged 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 

as of december 31 2020 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31 2020 rates and the assumed rates 

our operations in argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of an argentine peso versus the us dollar applied to our net peso monetary position are recorded in other income and expense net at the time of the change as of december 31 2020 kc argentina had a small net peso monetary position and a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not be material 



the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2020 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 750 in the view of management the above potential uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2020 the longterm debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixedrate debt f rom time to time we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt and those contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 

in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixedrate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments at december 31 2020 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 198 which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices in some instances we utilize negotiated shortterm contract structures including fixed price contracts to manage volatility for a portion of our commodity costs but derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and etailers with the consolidation of retail trade both traditional retailers and etailers we are increasingly dependent on key customers and some of these customers including largeformat retailers and large etailers may have significant bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of 



our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

intense competition for sales of our products changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels a growing ecommerce marketplace and customers and competitors actions our competitors for these markets include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price ecommerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions which could adversely affect our financial results 

we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products demand for our products may change based on many factors including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as privatelabel products and mid to lowertier value products low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors negative consumer response to pricing actions consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to etailers changing consumer preferences due to increased concerns in regard to postconsumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability or other changes in consumer trends or habits if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products also if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights we may be less competitive which could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

our strategy includes operations growth outside the us especially in developing markets such as china eastern europe asean and latin america about half of our net sales come from markets outside the us we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 34 countries and sell products in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks 





 the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina 

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar matters or breaches of consumer customer supplier employee or other confidential information real or perceived could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer in addition our products could face withdrawal recall or other quality issues consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity potentially with negative perception of our products or brands our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products   

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions failures or breaches or we fail to comply with data privacy or similar regulations our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data such as the general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer supplier employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event or any failure to comply with these data privacy requirements or other laws in this area could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability or regulatory or other penalties in addition we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation or other necessary supplies or services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in past years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices in some instances we utilize negotiated shortterm contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products and disposable wipes contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based 



on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources 

there can be no assurance that our efforts to increase selling prices in response to increased costs will be successful 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist in january 2018 we announced a global restructuring program the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

government regulations and enforcement and potential litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including laws and regulations involving marketing antitrust antibribery or anticorruption product liability environmental intellectual property or other matters as well as potential litigation or administrative actions 

if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image 

in addition new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business including brexit which could adversely impact our financial results for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials 

disruption in our supply chain or our manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business  

our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism epidemics including the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from china pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service 



providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our suppliers employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies including tax reform in the us that was enacted in december 2017 other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

we may periodically divest product lines or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses furthermore the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations including by enhancing our competitors positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products 

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity

unaudited quarterly data 





liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by operations was 27 billion in 2019 compared to 30 billion in 2018  the decrease was driven by increased working capital and tax payments partially offset by higher earnings and lower pension contributions 

obligations 

the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable   



 the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain the following payments are not included in the table 





investing 

our capital spending was 12 billion in 2019 and 09 billion 2018  reflecting incremental spending in 2019 related to the 2018 global restructuring program proceeds from dispositions of property in 2019 of 242 primarily reflects the proceeds from the sales of manufacturing facilities and associated real estate related to the 2018 global restructuring program and property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring we expect capital spending to be approximately 115 billion to 135 billion in 2020 including significant spending associated with the 2018 global restructuring program 

financing 

we issue longterm debt in the public market periodically proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness see item 8 note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details 

our shortterm debt which consists of us commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days andor other similar shortterm debt issued by nonus subsidiaries was 775 as of december 31 2019 included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet the average monthend balance of shortterm debt for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was 10 billion these shortterm borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations the level of shortterm debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions dividends and income taxes 

at december 31 2019  total debt was 77 billion compared to 75 billion at december 31 2018  

in february 2020 we issued 500 aggregate principal amount of 2875 notes due february 7 2050 proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of a portion of our commercial paper indebtedness 

we maintain a 20 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2023 and a 750 revolving credit facility which expires in june 2020 these facilities currently unused support our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason 

we paid 14 billion in dividends in 2019 the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 39 percent for 2020 we repurchase shares of kimberlyclark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs during 2019  we repurchased 62 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 800 through a broker in the open market we are targeting fullyear 2020 share repurchases between 700 and 900 subject to market conditions 

we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital payments for our 2018 global restructuring program capital spending pension contributions dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall business liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 



critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs generally the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee postretirement benefits 

substantially all regular employees in the us and the united kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain us and united kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit the principal plans certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8 note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations 

 as of december 31 2019  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 12 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2020 

 pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 105 in 2020  including incremental charges resulting from 2018 global restructuring program actions pension expense beyond 2020 will depend on future investment performance 



our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate 

 deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the us and uncertain tax positions our income tax related accounting policies account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8 note 11 to the consolidated financial statements

information concerning forwardlooking statements 

certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook including the anticipated cost savings from our force program costs and savings from the 2018 global restructuring program cash flow and uses of cash growth initiatives innovations marketing and other spending net sales anticipated currency rates and exchange risks including the impact in argentina raw material energy and other input costs effective tax rate contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberlyclark including dividends share repurchases and pension contributions constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberlyclark there can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them 

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside our control including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the prices and availability of our raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products energy costs our ability to maintain key customer relationships and retail trade customer actions as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business could affect the realization of these estimates 

the factors described under item 1a risk factors in this form 10k or in our other sec filings among others could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed through the systematic use of foreign currency forward contracts the use of these instruments supports the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part gains or losses on the underlying foreign currency exposure we also utilize cross currency swaps and foreign denominated debt to hedge certain investments in foreign subsidiaries the gain or loss on these instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income to offset the change in value of the net investments being hedged 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 



as of december 31 2019  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31 2019 rates and the assumed rates 

our operations in argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of an argentine peso versus the us dollar applied to our net peso monetary position are recorded in other income and expense net at the time of the change as of december 31 2019 kc argentina had a small net peso monetary position and a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not be material 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2019  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 550  in the view of management the above potential uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2019  the longterm debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixedrate debt f rom time to time we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt and those contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 

in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixedrate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments at december 31 2019  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 210  which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices in some instances we utilize negotiated shortterm contract structures including fixed price contracts to manage volatility for a portion of our commodity costs but derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 



significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation or other necessary supplies or services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in past years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices in some instances we utilize negotiated shortterm contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products and disposable wipes contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources 

there can be no assurance that our efforts to increase selling prices such as our recently announced plans to increase net selling prices across a majority of our north america consumer products businesses will be successful 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and etailers with the consolidation of retail trade both traditional retailers and etailers we are increasingly dependent on key customers and some of these customers including largeformat retailers and large etailers may have significant bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

intense competition for sales of our products changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels a growing ecommerce marketplace customers and competitors actions our competitors for these markets include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price ecommerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions which could adversely affect our financial results 



we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products demand for our products may change based on many factors including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as privatelabel products and mid to lowertier value products low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors negative consumer response to pricing actions consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to etailers or other changes in consumer trends or habits if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products also if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights we may be less competitive which could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist in january 2018 we announced a global restructuring program the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

our strategy includes operations growth outside the us especially in developing markets such as china eastern europe asean and latin america about half of our net sales come from markets outside the us we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 35 countries and sell products in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks 

 the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and item 8 note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina 



government regulations and enforcement and potential litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including laws and regulations involving marketing antitrust antibribery or anticorruption product liability environmental intellectual property or other matters as well as potential litigation or administrative actions 

if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image 

in addition new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business including the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union which could adversely impact our financial results for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials 

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions failures or breaches our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data such as the general data protection regulation gdpr which was recently adopted by the european union any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer supplier employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event or any failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr or other laws in this area could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability or regulatory or other penalties in addition we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 

disruption in our supply chain or the failure of thirdparty providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations  

our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our suppliers employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 



damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters or breaches of consumer customer supplier employee or other confidential information real or perceived could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity potentially with negative perception of our products or brands our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products   

new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies including tax reform in the us that was enacted in december 2017 other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

we may periodically divest product lines or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses furthermore the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations including by enhancing our competitors positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products 

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity

unaudited quarterly data 





liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by operations was 30 billion  in 2018  compared to 29 billion  in 2017  the increase was driven by improved working capital and lower tax payments mostly offset by lower earnings payments related to the 2018 global restructuring program and higher pension contributions cash provided by operations was 32 billion  in 2016  the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by higher tax payments 



obligations 

the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable   



 the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain the following payments are not included in the table 

 investing 

our capital spending was 09 billion  in 2018  and 08 billion 2017  we expect capital spending to be approximately 11 billion to 13 billion in 2019 including incremental spending associated with the 2018 global restructuring program 

financing 

we issue longterm debt in the public market periodically proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness see item 8 note 5  to the consolidated financial statements for details 

our shortterm debt which consists of us commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days andor other similar shortterm debt issued by nonus subsidiaries was 495  as of december 31 2018  included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet the average monthend balance of shortterm debt for the fourth  quarter of 2018  was 583  and for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  was 831  these shortterm borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations the level of shortterm debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions dividends and income taxes 

at december 31 2018  total debt was 75 billion  compared to 74 billion  at december 31 2017  

in june 2018 we entered into a 20 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2023 and a 500 revolving credit facility which expires in june 2019 these facilities currently unused replaced a similar 20 billion facility support our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason 

we paid 14 billion in dividends in 2018 the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 3 percent for 2019 we repurchase shares of kimberlyclark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs 



during 2018  we repurchased 73 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of 800  through a broker in the open market we are targeting fullyear 2019  share repurchases between 600 and 900 subject to market conditions 

our subsidiaries in argentina “kc argentina” began accounting for their operations as highly inflationary effective july 1 2018 as required by gaap under highly inflationary accounting kc argentina’s functional currency became the us dollar and its income statement and balance sheet have been measured in us dollars using both current and historical rates of exchange the effect of changes in exchange rates on pesodenominated monetary assets and liabilities has been reflected in earnings in other income and expense net and was not material as of december 31 2018 kc argentina had a small net peso monetary position net sales of kc argentina were less than 2  percent of our consolidated net sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 

management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall business liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs generally the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8 note 1  to the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies for these programs did not materially change with the adoption on january 1 2018 of the accounting standard update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers 

employee postretirement benefits 

substantially all regular employees in the us and the united kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain us and united kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit the principal plans certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8 note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations 

 as of december 31 2018  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 15 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains and whether such 



accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2019 

 pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 90  in 2019  including incremental charges resulting from 2018 global restructuring program actions pension expense beyond 2019  will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate 

 deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the us and uncertain tax positions our income tax related accounting policies account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8 note 12  to the consolidated financial statements 





foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and us state income taxes on such earnings while the transition tax resulted in a reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries any remaining amount of financial reporting over tax basis after such reduction could be subject to additional taxes if repatriated however we consider any excess to be indefinitely reinvested at this time the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the 49 billion  of previouslytaxed foreign earnings is not practicable 

 legal matters 

see item 8 note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on legal matters 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 

as of december 31 2018  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31 2018  rates and the assumed rates 

our operations in argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of an argentine peso versus the us dollar applied to our net peso monetary position are recorded in other income and expense net at the time of the change as of december 31 2018 kc argentina had a small net peso monetary position and a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not be material 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2018  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 550  in 



the view of management the above potential uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2018  the longterm debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixedrate debt f rom time to time we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt and those contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 

in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixedrate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments at december 31 2018  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 255  which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices in some instances we utilize negotiated shortterm contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility but derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

intense competition for sales of our products changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels a growing ecommerce marketplace customers and competitors actions our competitors for these markets include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions which could adversely affect our financial results 

we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products demand for our products may change based on many factors including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as privatelabel products and mid to lowertier value products low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors negative consumer response to pricing actions consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to etailers or other changes in consumer trends or habits if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products also if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights we may be less competitive which could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers discounters and etailers with the consolidation of retail trade both traditional retailers and etailers especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia we are increasingly dependent on key 



customers and some of these customers including largeformat retailers and large etailers may have significant bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist on january 23 2018 we announced a new global restructuring program the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation or other necessary supplies or services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in past years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products and disposable wipes contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

our strategy includes operations growth outside the us especially in developing markets such as china eastern europe and latin america about half of our net sales come from markets outside the us we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries and sell products in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks 





 the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions failures or breaches our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer supplier employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 

disruption in our supply chain or the failure of thirdparty providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations  

our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our suppliers employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

government regulations and enforcement and potential litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including laws and regulations involving marketing antitrust antibribery or anticorruption product liability environmental intellectual property or other matters as well as potential litigation or administrative actions 

if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents adverse regulatory action including a recall regulatory or other governmental investigation or product liability or other litigation may also adversely affect our financial condition and business operations although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of these proceedings may not be as expected 



in addition new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business including the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union which could adversely impact our financial results for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials 

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters or breaches of consumer customer supplier employee or other confidential information real or perceived could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity potentially with negative perception of our products or brands our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products   

new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect in our financial results 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies including tax reform in the us that was enacted in december 2017 overall the impact of us tax reform should reduce our effective tax rate however additional guidance or interpretations of the tax act could negatively impact our financial results other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the 2014 spinoff of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

on october 31 2014 we completed the spinoff of our health care business creating a standalone publicly traded health care company halyard health inc halyard historically the irs provided companies seeking to perform a spinoff transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spinoff transaction would qualify for taxfree treatment however the irs no longer provides such advance rulings prior to completing the spinoff of our health care business we obtained an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our us stockholders will recognize taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us which if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect could invalidate the opinion of counsel in addition this opinion is not binding on the irs accordingly the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel 

if the spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff were deemed taxable each us holder of our common stock who received shares of halyard would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received

unaudited quarterly data 



liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by operations was 29 billion  in 2017  compared to 32 billion  in 2016  the decrease was driven by higher tax payments cash provided by operations was 23 billion  in 2015  the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by improved working capital and lower pension contributions 



obligations 

the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable   



 the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain the following payments are not included in the table 

 investing 

our capital spending was 08 billion  in 2017  and 2016  we expect capital spending to be approximately 11 billion in 2018 including incremental spending from the 2018 global restructuring program 

financing 

we issue longterm debt in the public market periodically proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness see item 8 note 4  to the consolidated financial statements for details 

our shortterm debt which consists of us commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days andor other similar shortterm debt issued by nonus subsidiaries was 547  as of december 31 2017  included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet the average monthend balance of shortterm debt for the fourth  quarter of 2017  was 419  and for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  was 417  these shortterm borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations the level of shortterm debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions dividends and income taxes 

at december 31 2017  total debt was 74 billion  compared to 76 billion  at december 31 2016  

we maintain a 20 billion revolving credit facility which expires in 2021 this facility currently unused supports our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason 

we paid 14 billion in dividends in 2017 the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 31 percent for 2018 we repurchase shares of kimberlyclark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs 



during 2017  we repurchased 72 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of 900  through a broker in the open market we are targeting fullyear 2018  share repurchases between 700 and 900 subject to market conditions 

management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall business liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies for these programs did not materially change with the adoption on january 1 2018 of the accounting standard update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers 

employee postretirement benefits 

we have defined benefit pension plans in the us and the united kingdom the principal plans andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8 note 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate the obligations 

 as of december 31 2017  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 15 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2018 





if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2018  and the december 31 2017 pension liability would increase by about 145  

 pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 35  in 2018  pension expense beyond 2018  will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans the estimate of pension expense for 2018 does not include any potential effects related to the 2018 global restructuring program see item 8 note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate 

 our related accounting policies account balances and the effects of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate are discussed in item 8 note 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the us and uncertain tax positions our income tax related accounting policies account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8 note 11  to the consolidated financial statements 





and facts of each matter these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations 

legal matters 

we are party to certain legal proceedings relating to our former health care business halyard which we spunoff on october 31 2014 this includes bahamas surgery center v kimberlyclark corporation et al a california consumer class action relating to the sale of surgical gowns on april 7 2017 the jury awarded the plaintiff class 39 in compensatory damages and 350 in punitive damages against us we have filed motions challenging the jury’s verdict as we believe it is contrary to the evidence presented at trial and that the punitive damage award is baseless excessive and not consistent with california and federal laws under the terms of the distribution agreement we entered into with halyard in connection with the spinoff halyard is obligated to indemnify us for legal proceedings claims and other liabilities primarily related to our former health care business halyard and kimberlyclark have each filed suits against the other seeking declaratory judgment regarding the scope of these indemnification obligations we are also party to additional legal proceedings relating to halyard including civil actions qui tam matters a shareholder derivative suit a securities class action and certain subpoena and document requests from the federal government although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we continue to believe that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

tableend as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 

as of december 31 2017  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31 2017  rates and the assumed rates 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2017  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 750  in the view of management the above potential uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2017  the longterm debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixedrate debt 



in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixedrate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments at december 31 2017  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 285  which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

our strategy includes operations growth outside the us especially in developing markets such as china latin america and eastern europe about half of our net sales come from markets outside the us we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries and sell products in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks 

 the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

intense competition for sales of our products changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitors actions our competitors for these markets include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price the 



actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions which could adversely affect our financial results 

we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products demand for our products may change based on many factors including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as privatelabel products and mid to lowertier value products low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors negative consumer response to pricing actions or changes in consumer trends or habits if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products also if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights we may be less competitive which could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have significant bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via ecommerce as well as the growth of largeformat retailers and discounters that exclusively sell privatelabel products 

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters or breaches of consumer customer supplier employee or other confidential information real or perceived could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity potentially with negative perception of our products or brands our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination the distribution and sale of counterfeit products or a failure or breach of our information technology systems   

government regulations and enforcement and potential litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including laws and regulations involving marketing antitrust antibribery or anticorruption product liability environmental intellectual property or other matters as well as potential litigation or administrative actions 

if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents adverse regulatory action including a recall regulatory or other governmental investigation or product liability or other litigation may also adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 



although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of these proceedings may not be as expected 

in addition new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business which could adversely impact our financial results for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials 

new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect in our financial results 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies or are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

disruption in our supply chain or the failure of thirdparty providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations  

our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our vendors employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in past years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products and disposable wipes contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials generally we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully 



protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions failures or breaches our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer vendor employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 

the 2014 spinoff of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

on october 31 2014 we completed the spinoff of our health care business creating a standalone publicly traded health care company halyard health inc halyard historically the irs provided companies seeking to perform a spinoff transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spinoff transaction would qualify for taxfree treatment however the irs no longer provides such advance rulings prior to completing the spinoff of our health care business we obtained an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our us stockholders will recognize taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us which if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect could invalidate the opinion of counsel in addition this opinion is not binding on the irs accordingly the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel 

if the spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff were deemed taxable each us holder of our common stock who received shares of halyard would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations

obligations 

the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable   







the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain the following payments are not included in the table 

 investing 

our capital spending was 08 billion  in 2016  and 11 billion in 2015  we expect capital spending to be 850 to 950 in 2017 

financing 

we issue longterm debt in the public market periodically proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness see item 8 note 7  of the consolidated financial statements for details 

our shortterm debt which consists of us commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days andor other similar shortterm debt issued by nonus subsidiaries was 170  as of december 31 2016  included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet the average monthend balance of shortterm debt for the fourth  quarter of 2016  was 227  and for the twelve months ended december 31 2016  was 512  these shortterm borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations the level of shortterm debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions dividends and income taxes 

at december 31 2016  total debt was 76 billion  compared to 78 billion  at december 31 2015  

we maintain a 20 billion revolving credit facility which expires in 2021 this facility currently unused supports our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales and the promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee postretirement benefits 

pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans in the united states and the united kingdom the principal plans andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees our related accounting policies and account balances as well as the 2015 transaction related to our us pension plan are discussed in item 8 note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate the obligations 

 as of december 31 2016  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 15 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2017 





pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 65  in 2017  pension expense beyond 2017  will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postretirement benefit plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate the obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate 

 our related accounting policies account balances and the effects of a one percentage point change in the healthcare cost trend rate are discussed in item 8 note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the us and uncertain tax positions 





our income tax related accounting policies account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8 note 14  to the consolidated financial statements 

legal matters

 information concerning forwardlooking statements 

certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook including the anticipated cost savings from our force program cash flow and uses of cash growth initiatives innovations marketing and other spending net sales anticipated currency rates and exchange risks raw material energy and other input costs effective tax rate contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberlyclark including dividends share repurchases and pension contributions constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberlyclark there can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them 

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside our control including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the prices and availability of our raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products energy costs and retail trade customer actions as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business could affect the realization of these estimates 

the factors described under item 1a risk factors in this form 10k or in our other sec filings among others could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 

as of december 31 2016  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31 2016  rates and the assumed rates 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2016  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 650  these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2016  exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2016  the debt portfolio was composed of essentially all fixedrate debt 

in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixedrate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments at december 31 2016  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 227  which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value 



commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

our strategy includes operations growth outside the us especially in developing markets such as china latin america and eastern europe more than half of our net sales come from markets outside the us we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 39 countries and sell products in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks 

 



the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity see recent developments mda and item 8 note 1  for information about the impact on our operations from currency restrictions in venezuela and our decision to deconsolidate our venezuelan operations at december 31 2015  

intense competition for sales of our products changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitors actions our competitors for these markets include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions which could adversely affect our financial results 

we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products demand for our products may change based on many factors including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as privatelabel products and mid to lowertier value products low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors negative consumer response to pricing actions or changes in consumer trends or habits if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products also if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights we may be less competitive which could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters or breaches of consumer customer supplier employee or other confidential information real or perceived could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity potentially with negative perception of our products or brands our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination the distribution and sale of counterfeit products or a failure or breach of our information technology systems   

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have significant bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be 



adversely affected in addition the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via ecommerce as well as the growth of largeformat retailers and discounters that exclusively sell privatelabel products 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in past years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products and disposable wipes contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials generally we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy 

new or revised legal or regulatory requirements potential litigation or administrative actions or tax matters could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business including laws and regulations involving marketing antitrust antibribery or anticorruption product liability environmental intellectual property or other matters as well as potential litigation or administrative actions additionally our sales and results of operations may be adversely impacted by new or revised legal requirements including excise or other taxes financial reform legislation and regulations export control and foreign sanctions legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials adverse regulatory action including a recall regulatory or other governmental investigation or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of these proceedings may not be as expected 



disruption in our supply chain or the failure of thirdparty providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations  

our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our vendors employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions failures or breaches our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer vendor employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 

we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

we periodically divest product lines or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures furthermore the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations including by enhancing our competitors positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products 

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 



the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the 2014 spinoff of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders 

on october 31 2014 we completed the spinoff of our health care business creating a standalone publicly traded health care company halyard health inc halyard historically the irs provided companies seeking to perform a spinoff transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spinoff transaction would qualify for taxfree treatment however the irs no longer provides such advance rulings prior to completing the spinoff of our health care business we obtained an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our us shareholders will recognize taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us which if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect could invalidate the opinion of counsel in addition this opinion is not binding on the irs accordingly the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel 

if the spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff were deemed taxable each us holder of our common stock who received shares of halyard would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend introduction 

this mda is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance financial condition and prospects dollar amounts are reported in millions except per share dollar amounts unless otherwise noted the following will be discussed and analyzed 

 throughout this mda we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us or gaap and are therefore referred to as nongaap financial measures these measures include adjusted operating profit adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share adjusted other income and expense net and adjusted effective tax rate we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management 

nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap there are limitations to these nongaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded we compensate for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as a supplement to the gaap measures and by providing reconciliations of the nongaap and comparable gaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this mda 

 in addition we provide commentary regarding organic net sales which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency rates and lower sales in 2014 and 2013 associated with european strategic changes and tissue restructuring actions

2014 organization restructuring 

in october 2014 we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spinoff of our health care business the restructuring is intended to improve our underlying profitability and increase our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth 

the restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016  with total costs anticipated to be 130  to 160  after tax  190  to 230  pretax cash costs are projected to be approximately 80 percent  of the total charges cumulative pretax savings from the restructuring are expected to be 120  to 140  by the end of 2017  and were 70 by the end of 2015 the restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies

restructuring actions related to the strategic changes involved the sale or closure of five  of our european manufacturing facilities and streamlining of our administrative organization the restructuring actions commenced in 2012 and were completed by december 31 2014  the restructuring resulted in cumulative pretax charges of 413   338  after tax over that period 

for information on the charges by year see item 8 note 4  to the consolidated financial statements 

venezuela charges 

effective december 31 2015  we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of our business in venezuela from our consolidated balance sheet and moved to the cost method of accounting for our operations in that country the change reflects the continued deterioration of conditions in the country including a slowdown in the availability of foreign exchange and resulted in an after tax charge of 102  in the fourth quarter of 2015  beginning in the first quarter of 2016  we will no longer include the results of our venezuelan business in our consolidated financial statements we also recorded nondeductible charges of 45  and 462  and pretax charges of 36  aftertax of 26 related to the remeasurement of the venezuelan balance sheet in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively for information on the charges by year see item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by operations was 23 billion  in 2015  compared to 28 billion  in 2014  the decrease was driven by higher pension contributions in conjunction with the transfer of the pension benefit obligations to two insurance companies in the second quarter of 2015 the spinoff of the health care business in the fourth quarter of 2014  and increased operating working capital cash provided by operations of 28 billion in 2014 decreased compared to 30 billion in 2013 due to higher tax payments and transaction costs for the health care spinoff partially offset by lower payments for restructuring items 

  



obligations 

the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable   



 the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain the following payments are not included in the table 

 investing 

our capital spending was 11 billion  in 2015  and 10 billion in 2014  we expect capital spending to be 950 to 1050 in 2016  

financing 

in august 2015 we issued 250 aggregate principal amount of 215 notes due august 2020 and 300 aggregate principal amount of 305 notes due august 2025 proceeds from the offering were used to repay 300 of notes due in august 2015 and to pay down a portion of our outstanding commercial paper balance 

in february 2015 we issued 250 aggregate principal amount of 185 notes due march 2020 and 250 aggregate principal amount of 265 notes due march 2025 proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including pension contribution payments 

in 2015 at our election we redeemed 200  of dealer remarketable securities 

our shortterm debt which consists of us commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days andor other similar shortterm debt issued by nonus subsidiaries was 1071  as of december 31 2015  included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet the average monthend balance of shortterm debt for the fourth  quarter of 2015  was 971  and for the twelve months ended december 31 2015  was 993  these shortterm borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting 



our operations the level of shortterm debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions dividends and income taxes 

at december 31 2015  total debt was 78 billion  compared to 70 billion  at december 31 2014  

we maintain a 20 billion revolving credit facility which expires in 2019 this facility currently unused supports our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason 

we paid 13 billion in dividends in 2015 we repurchase shares of kimberlyclark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs during 2015  we repurchased 71 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of 800  through a broker in the open market in addition we acquired the remaining interest in our subsidiary in israel for 151 we are targeting fullyear 2016  share repurchases of 600 to 900 subject to market conditions 

management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall business liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales and the promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

employee postretirement benefits 

pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans in the united states and the united kingdom the principal plans andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees effective january 2015 the us pension plan was amended to include a lumpsum pension benefit payout option for certain plan participants in addition in april 2015 the us pension plan completed the purchase of group annuity contracts that transferred to two insurance companies the pension benefit obligations totaling 25 billion for approximately 21000  kimberlyclark retirees in the united states as a result of these changes we recognized pension settlementrelated charges of 08 billion  after tax  14 billion  pretax in other income and expense net during the twelve months ended december 31 2015  mostly in the second quarter during 2015  we made cash contributions of 484  to our pension trusts of which 410  relates to the changes to the us plan our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8 note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and the benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate the obligations 

 



asset allocation actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses calculated value over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets 

as of december 31 2015  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 14 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2016  

 pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 75  in 2016  pension expense beyond 2016  will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postretirement benefit plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate the obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate 

 our related accounting policies account balances and the effects of a one percentage point change in the healthcare cost trend rate are discussed in item 8 note 9  to the consolidated financial statements 

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the us and uncertain tax positions 

 



valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized

 information concerning forwardlooking statements 

certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook including the anticipated costs scope timing and financial and other effects of the 2014 organization restructuring the anticipated cost savings from the company’s force program cash flow and uses of cash growth initiatives innovations marketing and other spending cost savings and reductions net sales anticipated currency rates and exchange risks raw material energy and other input costs contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberlyclark including dividends share repurchases and pension contributions constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberlyclark there can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them 

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside our control including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the prices and availability of our raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products energy costs and retail trade customer actions as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business could affect the realization of these estimates 

the factors described under item 1a risk factors in this form 10k or in our other sec filings among others could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 



as of december 31 2015  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31 2015  rates and the assumed rates 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2015  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 700  these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2015  exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2015  the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 29 percent  variablerate debt and 71 percent  fixedrate debt 

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2015  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 186  which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variablerate debt with respect to variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the corporation as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 and our report dated february 11 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

intense competition for sales of our products changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitors actions our competitors for these markets include global regional and local manufacturers including private label manufacturers some of these competitors may have 



better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions which could adversely affect our financial results 

we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products demand for our products may change based on many factors including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as privatelabel products and mid to lowertier value products low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors negative consumer response to pricing actions or changes in consumer trends or habits if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products our earnings could decrease 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

our strategy includes growing our operations outside the us especially in developing markets such as china latin america and eastern europe more than half of our net sales are generated from markets outside the us we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries with products sold in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks 

 the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity see recent developments mda and item 8 note 1  for information about the effects of currency restrictions and related exposures in venezuela 

increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have significant bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers 



such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via ecommerce as well as the growth of largeformat retailers and discounters that exclusively sell privatelabel products 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in recent years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility and this volatility is expected to continue increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products and disposable wipes contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials generally we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy 

disruption in our supply chain or the failure of thirdparty providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations  

we operate on a global scale and therefore our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our vendors employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from 



reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions if we cannot successfully implement our cost saving and restructuring plans we may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

in october 2014 we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spinoff of our health care business the successful implementation of this program presents significant organizational challenges including successfully managing the relationship with halyard and we may not be able to realize all of the expected benefits of the program any failure to implement our restructuring plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

new or revised future legal or regulatory requirements potential litigation or administrative actions or tax matters could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations including regulations by the us food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies as well as potential litigation or administrative actions additionally our sales and results of operations may be adversely impacted by new or revised legal requirements including excise or other taxes financial reform legislation and regulations export control and foreign sanctions legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials adverse regulatory action including a recall regulatory or other governmental investigation or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal or income tax requirements may not be as expected 

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters or breaches of consumer customer supplier employee or other confidential information real or perceived could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination the distribution and sale of counterfeit products or a failure or breach of our information technology systems   

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions failures or breaches our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer vendor employee or investor 



information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 

we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

we periodically divest product lines or businesses including the current year spinoff of our health care business these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses mitigate corporate overhead costs allocated to those businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures furthermore the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations including by enhancing our competitors positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products 

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the spinoff of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders 

historically the irs provided companies seeking to perform a spinoff transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spinoff transaction would qualify for taxfree treatment however the irs no longer provides such advance rulings prior to completing the spinoff of our health care business we obtained an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our us shareholders will recognize taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us which if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect could invalidate the opinion of counsel in addition this opinion is not binding on the irs accordingly the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel 

if the spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff were deemed taxable each us holder of our common stock who received shares of halyard would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received

2014 organization restructuring 

in october 2014 we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spinoff of our health care business the restructuring is intended to improve our underlying profitability and increase our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth 

the restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016 with total costs anticipated to be 130  to 160  after tax  190  to 230  pretax cash costs are projected to be approximately 80 percent  of the total charges workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of 1100  to 1300  and primarily impact salaried employees cumulative pretax savings from the restructuring are expected to be 120  to 140  by the end of 2017 and were 5 in 2014 the restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies 

during 2014  133  of pretax charges were recognized for the organization restructuring including 40  recorded in cost of products sold and 93  recorded in marketing research and general expenses primarily for workforce reductions a related benefit of 38  was recorded in provision for income taxes on a geographic basis 47  of the charges were recorded in north america 28  in europe and 58  in our other international operations in asia latin america the middle east eastern europe and africa

restructuring actions related to the strategic changes involved the sale or closure of five  of our european manufacturing facilities and streamlining our administrative organization the restructuring actions commenced in 2012 and were completed by december 31 2014  the restructuring resulted in cumulative pretax charges of 413   338  after tax over that period 

for information on the charges by year financial statement classification and segment see item 8 notes 4  and 18  to the consolidated financial statements 

pulp and tissue restructuring actions 

in 2011 and 2012 we executed pulp and tissue restructuring actions in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and kcp businesses these actions involved the streamlining sale or closure of   seven   of our manufacturing facilities around the world in conjunction with these actions we exited certain nonstrategic products primarily nonbranded offerings and transferred some production to lowercost facilities in order to improve overall profitability and returns the actions were substantially complete at december 31 



2012   the restructuring resulted in cumulative pretax charges of 550   375  after tax over that period see item 8 notes 5  and 18  to the consolidated financial statements for more information

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations 

cash provided by operations was 28 billion  in 2014  compared to 30 billion  in 2013  the decrease was driven by higher tax payments and transaction costs for the health care spinoff partially offset by lower payments for restructuring items 

obligations 

the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable   



 



obligations based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows we believe exposure to losses if any under these arrangements is not material 

 the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain the following payments are not included in the table 

 investing 

our capital spending was 10 billion  in both 2014  and 2013  we expect capital spending to be 950 to 1050 in 2015  

financing 

on october 17 2014  we issued debt of 640  aggregate principal amount that was transferred to halyard as part of the spinoff 

on may 22 2014 we issued 300 aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due may 19 2016 and 300 aggregate principal amount of 19 notes due may 22 2019 proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes and repurchases of common stock

in december 2014 we repaid 500 of redeemable preferred securities see item 8 note 9  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the securities 

at december 31 2014  and 2013  total debt and redeemable securities was 70 billion  and 63 billion  respectively 

in june 2014 we entered into a 20 billion revolving credit facility which expires in 2019 this facility currently unused replaced a similar facility for 15 billion supports our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason 

we repurchase shares of kimberlyclark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs during 2014  we repurchased 180 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of 20 billion  through a broker in the open market including the impact of approximately 600 from the spinoff of our health care business in 2015  we plan to repurchase 08 billion to 10 billion of shares through open market purchases subject to market conditions 

we account for our operations in venezuela using highly inflationary accounting we have historically measured results in venezuela at the rate in which we transact our business which in 2012 was 54 bolivars per us dollar and 63 bolivars per us dollar through much of 2013 and 2014 given the level of uncertainty and lack of liquidity in venezuela in part due to recent declines in the price of oil we remeasured our local currencydenominated balance sheet as of december 31 2014 at the year end floating sicad ii exchange rate of 50 bolivars per us dollar this remeasurement resulted in a nondeductible charge of 462 in the consolidated income statement for the year ended december 31 2014 with 41 recorded in cost of products sold and 421 recorded in other 



income and expense net see additional information in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2014 kc venezuela had a bolivardenominated net monetary asset position primarily cash of 59  and our net investment in kc venezuela was 152 both valued at 50 bolivars per us dollar net sales of kc venezuela represented approximately 3 percent of consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2014 and approximately 2 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

in january 2015 we measured results in venezuela at the floating sicad ii exchange rate in midfebruary 2015 the government of venezuela announced changes to their threetiered currency exchange system we are evaluating the implications of these changes to assess the impact on our results and reporting for our operations in that country 

management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products expected to be sold to specific customers our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements factors affecting the accruals for promotions include 

 generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories 

employee postretirement benefits 

pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans in north america and the united kingdom the principal plans andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8 note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and the benefit obligations particularly the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate the obligations 

 



on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets 

as of december 31 2014  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 29 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2015  

 pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 100  in 2015  pension expense beyond 2015  will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

other postretirement benefit plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8 note 11 to the consolidated financial statements changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations particularly the discount rates used to calculate the obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate 

 deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally income tax related accounting policies account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8 note 16 to the consolidated financial statements changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the us and uncertain tax positions 

 



and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 



as of december 31 2014  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 35  excluding the effect of an unfavorable change in the venezuelan bolivar discussed below these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2014  rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the us dollar applied to our bolivardenominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change at december 31 2014  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 5  there are no viable options for hedging this exposure 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2014  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 800  these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2014  exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2014  the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 27 percent  variablerate debt and 73 percent  fixedrate debt 

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2014  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 176  which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variablerate debt with respect to variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs which are used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

recent developments

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in recent years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility and this volatility is expected to continue increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products disposable wipes and various health care products contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products do not adjust if these adjustments significantly trail 



the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize substitutes with lower prices for these materials generally derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure that we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy 

increased pricing pressure intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we compete in highly competitive markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitive actions our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers lowcost manufacturers and rapidlyexpanding international manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs particularly with respect to private label products allowing them to offer products at a lower price the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect our financial results 

in addition we compete in highly competitive regional markets such as latin america europe middle east africa and asia intense competition in these areas may slow our sales growth and earnings potential as well as adversely impact our margins 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 

we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products 

global and regional economic conditions including recessions or slow economic growth and continuing global and regional credit market volatility could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results 

the global economy continues to be volatile with particular regions facing uncertain or slow economic growth these unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact 

 ongoing volatility in global and regional commodity currency and financial markets has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment we rely on access to credit markets specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets to provide 



supplemental funding for our operations although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access credit markets it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing credit markets in the future which may disrupt our businesses or further increase the cost of funding our operations 

prolonged global or regional recessions slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue margins and earnings 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries with products sold in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks we are subject to the impact of economic social and political instability in developing countries 

we are exposed to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar a portion of the exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations 

weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollarbased input costs for operations outside the us there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

in addition we face increased risks in our international operations including currency exchange restrictions and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the us adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers risks of expropriation difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights and developing and maintaining successful business alliances and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results see mda and item 8 note 1  for information about the effects of currency restrictions and related exposures in venezuela 

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions failures or breaches our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business this role includes 

 these information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks any failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

increased cybersecurity threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems any breach in our technology information security systems could result in the 



disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including sensitive customer vendor employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business any such event could cause damage to our reputation loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate to recover data to repair or replace networks or information systems or to protect against similar future events 

if we are unable to hire develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce it could have an adverse effect on our business 

our strategy includes a focus on hiring developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills we may not be able to successfully recruit develop and retain the key personnel that we need unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse skilled workforce could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via ecommerce as well as the growth of largeformat retailers and discounters that exclusively sell privatelabel products 

pending and potential future litigation administrative actions tax matters regulatory requirements and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company during the course of our business we are subject to various legal and administrative actions in which we assert our rights under various laws including intellectual property and data privacy laws we may not be successful in defending against these actions or in asserting these rights in addition we could incur substantial costs in defending against or in asserting our rights in these actions 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

aspects of our business including health care and personal care are subject to many laws and governmental regulations including regulations by the food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies as well as potential litigation adverse regulatory action including a recall regulatory or other governmental investigation or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our sales and results of operations may also be adversely impacted by new legal requirements including healthcare reform legislation excise or other taxes financial reform legislation and regulations export control and foreign sanctions legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials 

although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements may not be as expected see item 3 legal proceedings 



damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters real or perceived could negatively impact sentiments towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products   

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments see our discussion of our cost savings activities in mda if we cannot successfully implement our cost savings plans we may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

disruption in our supply chain or the failure of thirdparty providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations  

we operate on a global scale and therefore our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our vendors employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

moreover acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transactional costs all of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor liquidity 

alternatively we may periodically divest product lines or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively affect our financial results furthermore the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations including by enhancing our competitors positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products 



the proposed spinoff of our health care business may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline if at all 

in november 2013 we announced our intention to pursue a potential taxfree spinoff of our health care business execution of the proposed spinoff will require among other things i obtaining final approval from our board of directors ii filing a registration statement on form 10 with the sec iii obtaining an opinion of counsel that the transaction will qualify for taxfree treatment under irs regulations and iv obtaining an opinion from a nationallyrecognized investment banking firm or other authority confirming the viability and solvency of the new health care company after the distribution unforeseen circumstances could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect the proposed spinoff including possible issues or delays in obtaining the required regulatory approvals or clearances disruptions in capital and financial markets or other potential barriers therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spinoff under the expected plans or anticipated timeline if at all 

the proposed spinoff of our health care business will require significant expenditures and attention of management and may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition and if completed may not achieve the intended results 

we anticipate incurring significant expenses in connection with the proposed spinoff in addition completion of the proposed spinoff will require significant amounts of our management’s time and effort which could divert management’s attention from operating and growing our businesses and could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if the proposed spinoff is completed our operational and financial profile will change upon the separation of the health care business from our other businesses as a result our diversification of revenue sources will diminish and our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be negatively impacted additionally after the spinoff we may not be able to achieve our historical levels of synergies or cost savings which could result in higher cost allocation to our remaining segments 

the proposed spinoff of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders 

historically the irs has provided companies seeking to perform a taxfree spinoff transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spinoff transaction would qualify for taxfree treatment however last year the irs announced that it would no longer provide such advance rulings prior to completing the spinoff of our health care business we expect to receive an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our shareholders will recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff however this opinion will not be binding on the irs accordingly the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel moreover the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us which if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect could invalidate the opinion of counsel 

if the spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff were taxable each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new health care company would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received

financing 

at december 31 2013  and 2012  total debt and redeemable securities was 63 billion  and 67 billion  respectively in december 2013 a financial institution assumed our monetization loan of 397  and acquired ownership rights to most of the related note receivable see item 8 note 8  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the securities

we account for our operations in venezuela using highly inflationary accounting on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the central bank of venezuela central bank regulated currency exchange system rate to 63  bolivars per us dollar and the elimination of the sitme rate as a result of the devaluation we recorded a 26  aftertax charge  36  pretax related to the remeasurement of the local currencydenominated balance sheet to the new exchange rate in 2013  prior to this 



devaluation we used the central bank sitme rate of 54  bolivars per us dollar to measure k  c venezuelas bolivardenominated transactions into us dollars the 36  pretax charge is reflected in the consolidated income statement in other income and expense net for the year ended december 31 2013  in the consolidated cash flow statement this noncash charge is included in other in cash provided by operations

variable interest entities 

we have interests in the financing entities discussed in item 8 note 8  to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets and deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between us and our trade customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products promotion accruals as of december 31 2013  and 2012  were 311 and 319 respectively rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products expected to be sold to specific customers and were 358 and 340 at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively

we have defined benefit pension plans in north america and the united kingdom the principal plans andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for our qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded 

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 69  in 2013  compared with 122  in 2012  expense in 2013 included a benefit of 31 from a plan curtailment related to restructuring associated with the european strategic changes pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 626 percent  in 2013  compared with 649 percent  in 2012  and will be 598 percent  in 2014  the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 



on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the principal plans was 643 percent  in 2013  compared with 668 percent  in 2012  and will be 616 percent  in 2014  the expected longterm rates of return are evaluated on an annual basis in setting these assumptions we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate 

pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses calculated value over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2013  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 25 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  

the discount or settlement rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligation at december 31 2013  was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan for the uk and canadian plans the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans increased to 476 percent  at december 31 2013  from 412 percent at december 31 2012  these rates are used as an input in calculating pension expense for 2014 and 2013 respectively 

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 110  in 2014  this estimate includes a charge of approximately 15 from an expected plan settlement related to the european strategic changes pension expense beyond 2014  will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 13  in 2014  if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 3  and the december 31 2013  pension liability would increase by about 177  

the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was 56 billion  and 54 billion  at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately 06 billion  and 12 billion  at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively on a consolidated basis we contributed 220  to our pension plans in 2013  compared with 110  in 2012  in addition we made direct benefit payments of 13  in 2013  and 14  in 2012  we currently anticipate contributing 100  to 200  to our pension plans in 2014  

other postretirement benefit plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees have access to our unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans we made benefit payments of 52  in 2013  compared with 55  in 2012  the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent there would be no impact to 2014  other postretirement benefit expense and the december 31 2013  benefit liability would increase by about 18  

the methodology for determining the discount rate used for each countrys other postretirement benefit obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that countrys pension obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for our consolidated operations may appear different due to the unique benefit payments of the plans 

the healthcare cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the healthcare marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage healthcare cost trend rate is expected to be 62 percent  in 2014  and to gradually decline to 50 percent  in 2022  and thereafter see item 8 note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the healthcare cost trend rate 



goodwill and other intangible assets 

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred during the third quarter of 2013 we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from the beginning of the fourth quarter to the beginning of the third quarter which did not result in the delay acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge we believe this timing is preferable as it better aligns the goodwill impairment test with our strategic business planning process which is a key component of the goodwill impairment test the change was applied prospectively as retrospective application would have been impractical because we are unable to objectively select assumptions that would have been used in previous periods without the benefit of hindsight 

impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of a reporting unit that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated 

if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value it has been determined that our 32 billion  of goodwill is not impaired 

we have no significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2013  we have intangible assets with finite useful lives with a gross carrying amount of 546  and a net carrying amount of 236  these assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value based on discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as of december 31 2013  we have recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling 604 and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 173  thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 431  as of december 31 2012  the net deferred tax asset was 527  these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

as of december 31 2013  us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 98 billion  of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to one of our us entities or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate 

we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in our income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter these liabilities may be affected by 



changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations our us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2009 irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2003 we have various federal income tax return positions in administrative appeals or litigation for 1999 to 2009 we currently believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

legal matters 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and governmental inquiries inspections audits or investigations pertaining to issues such as contract disputes product liability tax matters patents and trademarks advertising pricing business practices governmental regulations employment and other matters although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters to the extent not previously provided for will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and are operating in compliance with or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations we have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the us federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of sites where hazardous substances are present none of our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations individually or in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

business outlook 

2014 operating results 

we plan to continue to execute our global business plan strategies which include a focus on targeted growth initiatives innovation and brand building cost savings programs and shareholderfriendly capital allocation in 2014 we expect gaap earnings per share in a range of 595 to 617 growth in organic volume net selling prices and product mix is expected to be in the combined 3 to 5 percent target range led by kci we expect net sales to be negatively impacted by lost sales from the european strategic changes and pulp and tissue restructuring actions of 1 percent and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 2 to 3 percent we plan to achieve cost savings of at least 300 to help offset anticipated unfavorable foreign currency translation operating profit impacts of 3 to 4 percent and commodity cost inflation of 150 to 250 we anticipate that advertising and research and development spending will increase faster than sales to support targeted growth initiatives and innovation activities we expect the effective tax rate to be between 310 and 325 percent we anticipate capital spending to be in a 10 to 12 billion range and share repurchases to total 13 to 15 billion subject to market conditions we expect to contribute 100 to 200 to our defined benefit pension plans and to increase our quarterly dividend 2 to 4 percent effective april 2014 subject to approval by the board of directors the 2014 assumptions include a full year of the health care business and do not include spinoff transaction or related costs 

potential spinoff of health care business 

in november 2013 we announced that our board of directors authorized management to pursue a potential taxfree spinoff of our health care business a spinoff would create a standalone publicly traded health care company with approximately 16 billion  in annual net sales focused on the sale of surgical and infection prevention products for the operating room and other medical supplies and medical devices focused on pain management respiratory and digestive health we expect that the spinoff would be in the form of a taxfree distribution of 100 percent of the new company’s common stock to kimberlyclark shareholders 

although our current target is to complete the spinoff by the end of the third quarter of 2014 there are no assurances as to when the proposed spinoff will be completed if at all or if the spinoff will be completed based on the expected plans 



information concerning forwardlooking statements 

certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook including the anticipated costs scope timing and financial and other effects of the european strategic changes and the pulp and tissue restructuring actions the proposed spinoff of our health care business cash flow and uses of cash growth initiatives innovations marketing and other spending cost savings and reductions net sales anticipated currency rates and exchange risks raw material energy and other input costs contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberlyclark including dividends share repurchases and pension contributions constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberlyclark there can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them 

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside our control including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the prices and availability of our raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products energy costs and retail trade customer actions as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business could affect the realization of these estimates 

the factors described under item 1a risk factors in this form 10k or in our other sec filings among others could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 

as of december 31 2013  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 25 excluding the effect of an unfavorable change in the venezuelan bolivar discussed below these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2013  rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 



our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the us dollar applied to our bolivardenominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change at december 31 2013  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 30 there are no viable options for hedging this exposure 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates as of december 31 2013  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 900 these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2013  exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2013  the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 15 percent variablerate debt and 85 percent fixedrate debt 

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2013  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 195 the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variablerate debt with respect to variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs which are used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care 



products in recent years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility and this volatility is expected to continue increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products disposable wipes and various health care products contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products do not adjust if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize substitutes with lower prices for these materials generally derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure that we use all forms of energy efficiently and costeffectively we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy 

increased pricing pressure intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we compete in highly competitive markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitive actions our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers lowcost manufacturers and rapidlyexpanding international manufacturers some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs allowing them to offer products at a lower price the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect our financial results 

in addition we compete in highly competitive regional markets such as latin america europe africa and asia intense competition in these areas may slow our sales growth and earnings potential as well as adversely impact our margins 

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 

we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products 

global and regional economic conditions including recessions or slow economic growth and continuing global and regional credit market volatility could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results 

the global economy continues to be volatile with particular regions facing uncertain or slow economic growth these unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact 

 



privatelabel products as well as declining birth rates in countries due to slow economic growth or other factors 

 ongoing volatility in global and regional commodity currency and financial markets has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment we rely on access to credit markets specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets to provide supplemental funding for our operations although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access credit markets it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing credit markets in the future which may disrupt our businesses or further increase our cost of funding our operations 

prolonged global or regional recessions slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue margins and earnings 

if we are unable to hire develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce it could have an adverse effect on our business 

our strategy includes a focus on hiring developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills we may not be able to successfully recruit develop and retain the key personnel that we need unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse skilled workforce could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via ecommerce as well as the growth of largeformat retailers and discounters that exclusively sell privatelabel products 

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries with products sold in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks we are subject to the impact of economic social and political instability in developing countries 

we are exposed to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar a portion of the exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations 

weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollarbased input costs for operations outside the us there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 



in addition we face increased risks in our international operations including currency exchange restrictions and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the us adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers risks of expropriation difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights and developing and maintaining successful business alliances and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results see mda and item 8 note 19 for information about the effects of currency restrictions and related exposures in venezuela 

pending litigation administrative actions tax matters regulatory requirements and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

as a global company during the course of our business we are subject to various legal and administrative actions in which we assert our rights under various laws including intellectual property laws we may not be successful in defending against these actions or in asserting these rights in addition we could incur substantial costs in defending against or in asserting our rights in these actions 

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the us and internationally many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have unpredictable enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates implementation of new taxes changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

aspects of our business including health care and personal care are subject to many laws and governmental regulations including regulations by the food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies as well as potential litigation adverse regulatory action including a recall regulatory or other governmental investigation or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

our sales and results of operations may also be adversely impacted by new legal requirements including healthcare reform legislation financial reform legislation and regulations export control and foreign sanctions legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials 

although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements may not be as expected see item 3 legal proceedings 

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters real or perceived could negatively impact sentiments towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products   

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments see our discussion of our cost savings activities in mda if we cannot successfully implement our cost savings plans we may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 



disruption in our supply chain or the failure of thirdparty providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations  

we operate on a global scale and therefore our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our vendors employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

moreover acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transactional costs all of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

alternatively we may periodically divest product lines or businesses such as in connection with the strategic changes we are making in our western and central european consumer and professional businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures in addition businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture which could negatively affect our financial results furthermore the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations including by enhancing our competitors positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products 

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions or failures our business operations could be disrupted 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient operation of our business this role includes ordering and managing materials from suppliers managing our inventory converting materials to finished products facilitating order entry and fulfillment processing transactions summarizing and reporting our results facilitating internal and external communications administering human resources functions and providing other processes necessary to manage our business the failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and negatively impact our results in addition these information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results

 commentary

improvements in huggies baby wipes adult incontinence products and feminine care including benefits from product innovation in the poise depend and u by kotex brands were mostly offset by lower sales of huggies diapers and pullups training pants

 analysis of operating profit 

by business segment 





by geographic area   



charges related to european strategic changes of 299 in 2012   and pulp and tissue restructuring charges of 134 and 413  in 2012  and 2011  respectively are included in corporate  other additionally a nondeductible business tax charge of 32 related to a law change in colombia is included in corporate  other in 2011  see item 8 notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in 2010 other income and expense net includes a 79 charge and corporate  other includes a 19 charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in venezuela 

commentary 

2012  versus 2011     



 consolidated operating profit increased 244 compared to the prior year operating profit benefited from increases in net sales cost savings of 295 and deflation in input costs of 90 these benefits were partially offset by increased marketing research and general expenses including 115 in higher strategic marketing spending administrative and research spending also increased in part to build further capabilities and support future growth foreign currency translation effects reduced operating profit by 55 as a result of the weakening of several currencies relative to the us dollar a lower level of income in other income expense net adversely impacted the operating profit comparison by 45 

 



by the impact of lower sales volumes and increases in marketing research and general expenses operating profit in kci increased as higher net selling prices and cost savings were partially offset by increased marketing research and general expenses and unfavorable currency effects in europe operating profit decreased due to higher marketing research and general expenses lower net sales and the negative impact of lower production volumes partially offset by cost savings and deflation in input costs 

 european strategic changes 

on october 23 2012 we approved strategic changes related to our western and central european consumer and professional businesses to focus our resources and investments on stronger market positions and growth opportunities we will be exiting the diaper category in that region with the exception of the italian market and divesting or exiting some lowermargin businesses mostly in consumer tissue in certain markets the changes will primarily affect our consumer businesses with a modest impact on kcp the businesses that will be exited or divested generate annual net sales of approximately 500 and negligible operating profit 

restructuring actions related to the strategic changes will involve the sale or closure of five  of our european manufacturing facilities and a streamlining of our administrative organization in total these actions will result in reducing our european workforce by approximately 1300 to 1500 positions 

the restructuring actions commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012 and are expected to be completed by december 31 2014  the restructuring is expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately 250  to 350  after tax  300  to 400  pretax over that period cash costs related to severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 50  to 60 percent of the charges noncash charges will consist primarily of asset impairment charges and incremental depreciation 

during 2012  299  of pretax charges were recognized for the strategic changes including 250  recorded in cost of products sold and 49  recorded in marketing research and general expenses a related benefit of 57  was recorded in provision for income taxes on a segment basis 66  213  and 20  of the charges were related to consumer tissue personal care and kcp respectively noncash charges totaled 165  in 2012 and 4  of the 134  cash charges recorded in 2012 have been paid as of december 31 2012

in 2011 we initiated a pulp and tissue restructuring plan in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and kcp businesses the restructuring involved the streamlining sale or closure of six of our manufacturing facilities around the world in conjunction with these actions we have exited certain nonstrategic products primarily nonbranded offerings and transferred some production to lowercost facilities in order to improve overall profitability and returns in 2012 we announced our decision to streamline an additional manufacturing facility in north america to further enhance the profitability of our consumer tissue business both restructuring actions were substantially complete as of december 31 2012 including the pending sale of one facility expected to close in the first half of 2013 

as a result of the restructuring activities versus the 2010 baseline we expect that by 2013 annual net sales will decrease by 250  to 300  and operating profit will increase by at least 75  in 2013 and at least 100  in 2014 through december 31 2012  we have recognized cumulative operating profit benefits of 60  from the restructuring actions 

during 2012  135  of charges were recognized for the restructuring actions including 128  recorded in cost of products sold 6  recorded in marketing research and general expenses and 1  recorded in other income and expense net a related benefit of 49  was recorded in provision for income taxes on a segment basis 125  and 9  of the charges were related to consumer tissue 



and kcp respectively on a geographic basis 97  of the charges were recorded in north america 35  in australia and 3  elsewhere 

noncash charges of 44  were recorded in 2012 cash payments of 91  were made in 2012

commentary 

2011  versus 2010   



 consolidated operating profit decreased 331 compared to the prior year the benefits of increases in net sales and cost savings of 265 were more than offset by charges of 415 related to the pulp and tissue restructuring inflation in key cost inputs of 580 and the negative effect of lower production volumes comparisons were also impacted by the effect of a 98  charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in venezuela in 2010

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operations commentary 

cash provided by operations was 33 billion  in 2012  compared to 23 billion  in 2011  with the increase primarily due to higher earnings improved working capital and lower defined benefit pension contributions 110 in 2012 versus 679 in 2011 

obligations commentary 

the following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable   



 



 the table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain the following payments are not included in the table 

 investing commentary 

 financing commentary 

 net sales of k‑c venezuela represented 2 percent of consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 and 1 percent of consolidated net sales in 2011 and 2010 in 2012 and 2011 k‑c venezuela represented 4 percent 



of consolidated operating profit in 2010 operating profit at our venezuelan subsidiary was negative due to the charge recorded as a result of adopting highly inflationary accounting 

management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 

variable interest entities 

we have interests in the financing entities discussed in item 8 notes 5 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement benefits future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets and deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between us and our trade customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products promotion accruals as of december 31 2012  and 2011  were 319 and 339 respectively rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products expected to be sold to specific customers and were 340 and 344 at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

employee postretirement benefits 

pension plans 

we have defined benefit pension plans in north america and the united kingdom the principal plans andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in these countries nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded 

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 122  in 2012  compared with 119  for 2011  pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 649 percent  in 2012  compared with 714  percent in 2011  and will be 626 percent  in 2013  the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the principal plans was 668 percent  in 2012  compared with 735 percent  in 2011  and will be 643 percent  in 2013  the expected longterm rates of return are evaluated on an annual basis in setting these assumptions we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the current asset allocation actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate 



pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses calculated value over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2012  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 29 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required  

the discount or settlement rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligation at december 31 2012  was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan for the uk and canadian plans the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans decreased to 412 percent  at december 31 2012  from 490 percent at december 31 2011  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 65  to 75  in 2013  compared to 122  incurred in 2012  the 2013  estimate includes an approximate 30 benefit from a plan curtailment related to the restructuring associated with the european strategic changes and is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 643 percent  a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 412 percent  and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2013  will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 12  in 2013  if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 3  and the december 31 2012  pension liability would increase by about 197  

the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was 54 billion  and 52 billion  at december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately 12 billion  and 07 billion  at december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively on a consolidated basis we contributed 110  to our pension plans in 2012  compared with 679  in 2011  in addition we made direct benefit payments of 14  in both 2012  and 2011  we currently anticipate contributing 100  to 300  to our pension plans in 2013  

the methodology for determining the discount rate used for each countrys pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that countrys other postretirement benefit obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for our consolidated operations may appear different due to the unique benefit payments of the plans 

other postretirement benefit plans 

substantially all us retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans certain benefits are based on years of service andor age at retirement the plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 contributory for most employees who retire after 1992 and we provide no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003 

we made benefit payments of 55  in 2012  compared with 74  in 2011  the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent there would be no impact to 2013  other postretirement benefit expense and the december 31 2012  benefit liability would increase by about 20  

the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage health care cost trend rate is expected to be 71 percent  in 2013  and to gradually decline to 51 percent  in 2018  and thereafter see item 8 note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate 



goodwill and other intangible assets 

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of a reporting unit that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated 

if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value it has been determined that our 33 billion  of goodwill is not impaired 

we have no significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2012  we have intangible assets with finite useful lives with a gross carrying amount of 516  and a net carrying amount of 235  these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value based on discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

as of december 31 2012  we have recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling 716 and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 189 thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 527 as of december 31 2011  the net deferred tax asset was 603 these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

as of december 31 2012  us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 95 billion  of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to one of our us entities or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate 

we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in our income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations our us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2009 irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2003 we have various federal income tax return positions in administrative appeals or litigation for 1999 to 2009 we currently believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 



legal matters 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections audits or investigations pertaining to issues such as contract disputes product liability tax matters patents and trademarks advertising governmental regulations employment and other matters although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters to the extent not previously provided for will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are subject to federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and are operating in compliance with or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations we have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of sites where hazardous substances are present none of our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations individually or in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

business outlook 

european strategic changes 

on october 23 2012 we approved strategic changes related to our western and central european consumer and professional businesses to focus our resources and investments on stronger market positions and growth opportunities we will be exiting the diaper category in that region with the exception of the italian market and divesting or exiting some lowermargin businesses mostly in consumer tissue in certain markets the changes will primarily affect our consumer businesses with a modest impact on kcp the businesses that will be exited or divested generate annual net sales of approximately 500 and negligible operating profit 

restructuring actions related to the strategic changes will involve the sale or closure of five  of our european manufacturing facilities and a streamlining of our administrative organization in total these actions will result in reducing our european workforce by approximately 1300 to 1500 positions 

the restructuring actions commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012 and are expected to be completed by december 31 2014 the restructuring is expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately 250  to 350  after tax  300  to 400  pretax over that period cash costs related to severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 50  to 60 percent of the charges noncash charges will consist primarily of asset impairment charges and incremental depreciation 

k‑c venezuela 

on february 13 2013 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the central bank of venezuela regulated currency exchange system rate to 63 bolivars per us dollar and the elimination of the sitme rate as a result of the devaluation we expect to record an after tax charge of 25 to 35 in the first quarter of 2013 related to the remeasurement of the local currencydenominated balance sheet to the new exchange rate 

2013  operating results 

in 2013 we plan to continue to pursue targeted growth initiatives launch product innovations and support our brands with increased strategic marketing spending we expect to achieve cost savings which should help us overcome moderate commodity cost inflation we will continue to manage our company with financial discipline including a focus on cash generation and shareholderfriendly capital allocation we plan to continue our program of share repurchases and have increased the amount of our regular quarterly dividend by 9 percent for 2013

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs 

as of december 31 2012  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 60 these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2012  rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the us dollar applied to our bolivardenominated net monetary asset position 



are recorded in income at the time of the change at december 31 2012  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 20 there are no viable options for hedging this exposure 

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

as of december 31 2012  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately 900 these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2012  exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2012  the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 16 percent variablerate debt and 84 percent fixedrate debt 

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2012  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 169 the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variablerate debt with respect to variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a risk factors there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs which are used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

  

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

  

increases in the cost and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products in recent years pulp prices have experienced significant volatility and this volatility is expected to continue increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants feminine pads incontinence care products disposable wipes and various health care products contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products do not adjust if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials or if we do not utilize substitutes with lower prices for these materials 

part i 

continued 

derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure that we use all forms of energy costeffectively we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy 

  

increased pricing pressure intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

we compete in highly competitive markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitive actions our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers lowcost manufacturers and rapidlyexpanding international manufacturers some of these competitors may have increased access to financial resources and increased market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs allowing them to offer products at a lower cost the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect our financial results 

in addition we compete in highly competitive regional markets such as in european personal care and tissue markets as well as in other areas such as latin america eastern europe africa and asia intense competition in these areas may slow our sales growth and earnings potential as well as adversely impact our margins 

  

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources these competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 

  

we may not be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry and we may not be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products 

  

global and regional economic conditions including recessions or slow economic growth and continuing global and regional credit market volatility could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

the global economy continues to be volatile with particular regions such as europe facing uncertain or slow economic growth these unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact 

   

part i 

continued 

ongoing volatility in global and regional commodity currency and financial markets including in europe has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment we rely on access to credit markets specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets to provide supplemental funding for our operations although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access credit markets it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing credit markets in the future which may disrupt our businesses or further increase our cost of funding our operations 

  

prolonged global or regional recessions slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue margins and earnings 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business 

  

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via ecommerce as well as the growth of largeformat retailers and discounters that exclusively sell privatelabel products 

pending litigation administrative actions tax matters regulatory requirements and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect 

  

as a global company during the course of our business we are subject to various legal and administrative actions in which we assert our rights under various laws including intellectual property laws we may not be successful in defending against these actions or in asserting these rights in addition we could incur substantial costs in defending against or in asserting our rights in these actions 

  

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the united states and internationally many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have volatile enforcement activity increases in applicable tax rates changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

aspects of our business including health care are subject to many laws and governmental regulations including regulations by the food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies as well as potential litigation adverse regulatory action including a recall or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

  

our sales and results of operations also may be adversely affected by new legal requirements including healthcare reform legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials 

  

although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements may not be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

if we are unable to hire develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce it could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our strategy includes a focus on hiring developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills we may not be able to successfully recruit develop and retain the key personnel that we need 

part i 

continued 

unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse skilled workforce could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

  there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

  

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments see our discussion of our cost savings activities in mda if we cannot successfully implement our cost savings plans however we may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk currency restrictions and political social and economic instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

  

because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 39 countries with products sold in more than 175 countries our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks we are subject to the impact of economic social and political instability in developing countries 

  

we are exposed to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar a portion of the exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations 

  

weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollarbased input costs for operations outside the us there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

in addition we face increased risks in our international operations including currency exchange restrictions and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the us adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers risks of expropriation difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights and developing and maintaining successful business alliances and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results see mda and item 8 note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the effects of currency restrictions and related exposures in venezuela 

  

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

  

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters real or perceived could negatively impact sentiments towards us and our products and brands and our business and financial results could suffer our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products   

we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

  

we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

  

the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

part i 

continued 

moreover acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transactions costs all of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

alternatively we may periodically divest product lines or businesses which may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses in addition businesses under consideration for divestiture may be adversely impacted which could negatively affect our financial results 

  

disruption in our supply chain or the failure of thirdparty providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations  

we operate on a global scale and therefore our ability to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our operations these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters power outages fires or explosions labor strikes terrorism pandemics import restrictions regional economic business environmental or political events governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products this interruption if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to address 

in addition third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at these thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our vendors employees and others and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 

if our information technology systems suffer interruptions or failures our business operations could be disrupted 

our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties serve an important role in the efficient operation of our business this role includes ordering and managing materials from suppliers managing our inventory converting materials to finished products facilitating order entry and fulfillment processing transactions summarizing and reporting our results facilitating internal and external communications administering human resources functions and providing other processes necessary to manage our business the failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and negatively impact our results in addition these information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events power outages security breaches computer viruses or cyberbased attacks while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations which may adversely affect our business and financial results

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections audits or investigations pertaining to issues such as contract disputes product liability patents and trademarks advertising governmental regulations employment and other matters although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters to the extent not previously provided for will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we are subject to federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and are operating in compliance with or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations we have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the us federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations individually or in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 pulp and tissue restructuring 

on january 21 2011 we initiated a pulp and tissue restructuring plan in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and kcp businesses the restructuring involves the streamlining sale or closure of six of our manufacturing facilities around the world in conjunction with these actions we have begun to exit certain nonstrategic products primarily nonbranded offerings and transfer some production to lowercost facilities in order to improve overall profitability and returns facilities impacted by the restructuring include a facility in everett washington two facilities in australia and two facilities in spain in addition in january of 2012 we decided to streamline an additional facility in north america to further enhance the profitability of the consumer tissue business 

part ii 

continued 

both restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2012 the restructuring actions are expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately 550 million to 600 million before tax  385 million  to 420 million after tax over 2011 and 2012 cash costs related to the streamlining of operations sale or closure relocation of equipment severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 30 percent to 40 percent  of the charges noncash charges will consist primarily of incremental depreciation 

as a result of the restructuring activities versus the 2010 baseline we expect that by 2013  annual net sales will decrease by 250 million to 300 million  and operating profit will increase by at least 75 million  in 2013 and 100 million in 2014 most of the restructuring will impact the consumer tissue business segment in 2011 we recognized benefits of 20 million from the restructuring actions 

during 2011 415 million  of charges were recognized for the restructuring actions including 407 million  recorded in cost of products sold 6 million  recorded in marketing research and general expenses and 2 million  recorded in other income and expense net a related benefit of 126 million  was recorded in provision for income taxes on a segment basis 357 million  and 56 million  of the charges related to the consumer tissue and kc professional  other respectively on a geographic basis 204 million  of the charges were recorded in north america 133 million  in australia and 78 million  elsewhere 

of the 415 million  charges recorded in 2011  329 million  were noncash of the 86 million  in cash charges 51 million  have been paid in 2011

management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future further we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future 

  

variable interest entities 

  

we have interests in the financing entities discussed in item 8 notes 6 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances pension and other postretirement 

benefits future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets the qualitative analyses used to determine the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities and deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

  

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between us and our trade customers rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products promotion accruals as of december 31 2011  and 2010  were 339 million and 352 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2011  and 2010  were 300 million and 353 million respectively 

  

employee postretirement benefits 

  

pension plans 

  

we have defined benefit pension plans in north america and the united kingdom the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in these countries nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 119 million  in 2011  compared with 133 million  for 2010  pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 714 percent  in 2011  compared with 796  percent in 2010  and will be 649 percent  in 2012  the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the principal plans was 735 percent  in 2011  compared with 819 percent  in 2010  and will be 668 percent  in 2012  the expected longterm rates of return are evaluated on an annual basis in setting these assumptions we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class and historical longterm market performance relative to the current asset allocation actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate 

part ii 

continued 

pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2011  the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately 24 billion  these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” as required  

  

the discount or settlement rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligation at december 31 2011  was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan for the uk and canadian plans the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities each year’s expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans decreased to 49 percent  at december 31 2011  from 558 percent at december 31 2010  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 105 to 115 million in 2012  compared to 119 million  incurred in 2011  the 2012  estimate is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 668 percent  a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 49 percent  and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2012  will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

  

if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 12 million  in 2012  if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 5 million  and the december 31 2011  pension liability would increase by about 170 million  

  

the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was 52 billion  and 46 billion  at december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately 07 billion  and 11 billion  at december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively on a consolidated basis we contributed 679 million  to our pension plans in 2011  compared with 245 million  in 2010  in addition we made direct benefit payments of 14 million  in 2011  compared to 24 million  in 2010  we currently anticipate contributing 50 million  to 100 million  to our pension plans in 2012  

  

the methodology for determining the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement benefit obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for our consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

other postretirement benefit plans 

  

substantially all us retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans certain benefits are based on years of service andor age at retirement the plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 contributory for most employees who retire after 1992 and we provide no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003 

  

we made benefit payments of 74 million  in 2011  compared with 64 million  in 2010  the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent 2012  other postretirement benefit expense would increase by less than 1 million  and the december 31 2011  benefit liability would increase by about 17 million  

  

the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage health care cost trend rate is expected to be 71 percent  in 2012  and to gradually decline to 51 percent  in 2018  and thereafter see item 8 note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit level the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated 

  

if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value it has been determined that our 33 billion  of goodwill is not impaired 

  

we have no significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2011  we have intangible assets with finite useful lives with a gross carrying amount of approximately 505 million  and a net carrying amount of about 254 million  these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value based on discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

  

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities “vie” 

  

the primary beneficiary of a vie is required to consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary of a vie is an enterprise that has an interest in a vie that provides the enterprise with the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie and the obligation to absorb significant losses or the right to receive significant benefits of the vie the primary beneficiary of a vie is required to be determined using a qualitative analysis considering such factors as the vie’s purpose and design the involvement of each interest holder in the vie and the risks and benefits the vie was designed to create and pass to interest holders an enterprise is required to perform ongoing reassessments to determine if it must consolidate a vie 

  

we exercise judgment in performing the ongoing qualitative primary beneficiary assessments for our interests in the vies described in item 8 notes 6 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

  

as of december 31 2011  we have recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling 794 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 191 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 603 million as of december 31 2010  the net deferred tax asset was 734 million these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2011  us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 84 billion  of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to one of our us entities or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized

deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate 

  

we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in our income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations our us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2007 irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2003 we have various federal income tax return positions in administrative appeals or litigation for 1999 to 2007 we currently believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

legal matters 

  

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections audits or investigations pertaining to issues such as contract disputes product liability patents and trademarks advertising governmental regulations employment and other matters although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters to the extent not previously provided for will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we are subject to federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and are operating in compliance with or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations we have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations individually or in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

pulp and tissue restructuring 

on january 21 2011 we adopted a pulp and tissue restructuring plan in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and kcp businesses in addition on january 24 2012 we announced our decision to streamline our manufacturing facility in chester pennsylvania to further enhance the profitability of our consumer tissue business estimated charges related to this additional restructuring action are expected to range from 30 million to 50 million before taxes 

both restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by december 31 2012 the restructuring actions are expected to result in cumulative charges in 2011 and 2012 of approximately 550 to 600 million before tax 385 to 420 million after tax cash costs are expected to account for approximately 30 to 40 percent of the total charges as a result of these restructuring actions versus the 2010 baseline we expect that by 2013 annual net sales will be reduced by 250 to 300 million and operating profit is expected to increase by at least 75 million in 2013 and at least 100 million in 2014 

2012 operating results 

we expect economic conditions to remain challenging in the near term particularly in developed markets we plan to continue focusing on innovation and targeted growth initiatives supporting both with strategic marketing spending we expect that commodity cost inflation will moderate in 2012 but results will likely be negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates weakening against the us dollar we plan to increase our investments in research and development and selling to support further growth and improve capabilities we will continue to manage our company with financial discipline and expect to deliver

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

  

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect management’s view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs 

  

part ii 

continued 

as of december 31 2011  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 50 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2011  rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these 

assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the us dollar applied to our bolivardenominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change at december 31 2011  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 13 million there are no viable options for hedging this exposure 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

as of december 31 2011  a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders’ equity by approximately 850 million these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2011  exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2011  the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 19 percent variablerate debt and 81 percent fixedrate debt 

  

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2011  a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 194 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variablerate debt with respect to variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control any of the risks discussed below as well as factors described in other places in this form 10k or in our other filings with the sec could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forwardlooking statements these risks are not the only ones we face other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us 

  

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services without corresponding increases in our selling prices could adversely affect our financial results 

  

increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters power outages labor strikes governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change concerns and the like could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets cellulose fiber in the form of fluff pulp is a key component in our personal care products increases in pulp prices could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

a number of our products such as diapers training and youth pants incontinence care products disposable wipes and various health care products contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

although we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints natural disasters and other factors including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

our manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure that we use all forms of energy costeffectively we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy 

  

increased pricing pressure intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

we compete in intensely competitive markets against wellknown branded products and lowcost or private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitive reaction our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers lowcost manufacturers and rapidlyexpanding international manufacturers these competitors may have greater financial resources and greater market penetration which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices alternatively some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs allowing them to offer products at a lower cost the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection in addition we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 

  

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that we will be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling our products 

  

global economic conditions including recessions or slow economic growth and continuing global credit market volatility could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

unfavorable global economic conditions including the impact of recessions slow economic growth economic and pricing instability and credit market volatility may continue to negatively affect our business and financial results these economic conditions could negatively impact 

  

   

   

   

   

part i 

continued 

 

  

ongoing volatility in global commodity currency and financial markets has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment we rely on access to the credit markets specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets to provide supplemental funding for our operations although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access the credit markets it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing the credit markets in the future which may disrupt our businesses or further increase our cost of funding our operations 

  

prolonged recessions slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue margins and earnings 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining power they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to hire develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce it could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our strategy includes a focus on hiring developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse skilled workforce could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recruit develop and retain the key personnel that we need 

  

our international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk currency restrictions and political instability which may adversely affect our financial results 

  

because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 39 countries with products sold in more than 150 countries our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks we are subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries 

  

we are subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar a portion of the exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations 

  

weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollarbased input costs for operations outside the us there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

in addition we face increased risks in our international operations including currency restrictions adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers risks of expropriation difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results see mda and item 8 note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the effects of currency restrictions currency devaluation and inflation in venezuela on our financial results in 2010 

  

in addition intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic political and competitive environments in latin america eastern europe africa and asia may slow our sales growth and earnings potential our success internationally also depends on our ability to acquire or form successful business alliances and there is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire or form these alliances in addition there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular market 

  

there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

  

we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations in addition we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities we anticipate these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments see mda if we cannot successfully implement our cost savings plans we may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results 

  

damage to the reputation of kimberlyclark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business 

  

developing and maintaining our reputation as well as the reputation of our brands is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers customers suppliers and others our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues including concerns about product safety quality efficacy or similar matters real or perceived could negatively impact sentiments towards us and our products and our business and financial results could suffer our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall productrelated litigation allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products 

  

our sales may not occur as estimated 

  

there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate consumer preferences estimate sales of new products estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of our products in new markets or anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses as a result we may not be able to achieve anticipated sales 

  

pending litigation administrative actions tax matters regulatory requirements and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect 

  

there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending against legal and administrative actions or in asserting our rights under various laws including intellectual property laws in addition we could incur substantial costs in defending against or in asserting our rights in these actions 

  

we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the united states and internationally increases in applicable tax rates changes in applicable tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our aftertax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

aspects of our business including health care are subject to many laws and governmental regulations including regulations by the food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies as well as potential litigation adverse regulatory action including a recall or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations 

  

our sales and results of operations also may be adversely affected by new legal requirements including health care reform legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials 

  

although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us there can be no assurance that the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements will be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses which could impact our results 

  

we may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

  

the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

moreover acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets all of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

alternatively we may periodically divest product lines or businesses which may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses 

  

we obtain certain manufactured products and administrative services from third parties if the thirdparty providers fail to satisfactorily perform our operations could be adversely impacted 

  

third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at the thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to regional economic business environmental or political events or information technology system failures or military actions or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations sales payments to our vendors employees and others and our ability to report financial and management 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

information on a timely and accurate basis administrative functions transferred to thirdparty service providers include certain information technology finance and accounting sourcing and supply management and human resources services although moving these administrative functions to thirdparty service providers has improved certain capabilities and lowered our cost of operations we could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are subject to various lawsuits and claims pertaining to issues such as contract disputes product liability patents and trademarks advertising employee and other matters although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters to the extent not previously provided for will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

we are subject to federal state and local environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and are operating in compliance with or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations we have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations individually or in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

in 2007 the delaware county regional water quality authority “delcora” initiated actions alleging that we underreported the quantity of effluent discharged to delcora from our chester mill for several years due to an inaccurate effluent flow metering device and that as a result we owed delcora 195 million delcora is a public agency that operates a sewerage system that serves our chester mill as well as other industrial and municipal customers delcora also regulates the discharge of wastewater from the chester mill we denied that we violated any environmental requirements and disputed delcora’s calculation of amounts owed for past wastewater treatment services in january 2011 the parties conducted a mediation that yielded a settlement agreement in which we will pay delcora 250000 as a monetary sanction and 375 million to settle the dispute over historic charges for wastewater treatment services as a result of this settlement the actions initiated by delcora in 2007 will be dismissed with prejudice and other pending disputes between the parties were resolved

in europe consumer tissue net sales decreased almost 14 percent due to unfavorable currency effects of 11 percent a decrease in sales volumes of 2 percent and a decrease of net selling prices of 1 percent the lower sales volumes were primarily because of reduced sales of bathroom tissue due to some consumer tradedown to lowerpriced product offerings

the table does not include future payments that we will make for other postretirement benefit obligations those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions including expected future service to project the future obligations based upon those projections we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately 68 million in 2011 to more than 74 million by 2020 

  

accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing of future payments

management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends pension plan contributions and other needs in the foreseeable future 

  

variable interest entities 

  

we have interests in the financing and real estate entities discussed in item 8 notes 2 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements the entities described in item 8 notes 2 and 9 are consolidated as are certain of the real estate entities described in note 14 the nonconsolidated real estate entities do not engage in any offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals pension and other postretirement benefits retained insurable risks useful lives for depreciation and amortization future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets the qualitative analyses used to determine the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments and loss contingencies these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

promotion and rebate accruals 

  

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between us and our trade customers rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products promotion accruals as of december 31 2010 and 2009 were 352 million and 364 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2010 and 2009 were 353 million and 365 million respectively 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

pension benefits 

  

we have defined benefit pension plans in north america and the united kingdom the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in these countries nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 133 million in 2010 compared with 251 million for 2009 pension expense in 2009 included a curtailment charge of about 21 million related to the freeze of our us defined benefit pension plans pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 796 percent in 2010 compared with 817 percent in 2009 and will be 714 percent in 2011 the expected longterm rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis in setting this assumption we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class current asset allocation and historical longterm market performance 

  

the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the principal plans was 819 percent in 2010 compared with 847 percent in 2009 and will be 735 percent in 2011 the expected longterm rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 60 percent with equity managers with expected longterm rates of return ranging from 9 to 10 percent and about 40 percent with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return ranging from 5 to 6 percent actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate longterm rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary 

  

pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2010 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately 22 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns or ii other factors including reduced pension 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” as required  

  

the discount or settlement rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligation at december 31 2010 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan for the uk and canadian plans the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities each year’s expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans decreased to 558 percent at december 31 2010 from 588 percent at december 31 2009 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 130 million in 2011 compared to 133 million incurred in 2010 the 2011 estimate is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 735 percent a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 558 percent and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2011 will depend on future investment performance our contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

  

if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 11 million in 2011 if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 7 million and the december 31 2010 pension liability would increase by about 163 million 

  

the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was 46 billion and 42 billion at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately 11 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively on a consolidated basis we contributed about 245 million to our pension plans in 2010 compared with 845 million in 2009 in addition we made direct benefit payments of 24 million in 2010 compared to 25 million in 2009 we currently anticipate contributing 400 million to 500 million to our pension plans in 2011 

  

the methodology for determining the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for our consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

other postretirement benefits 

  

substantially all us retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans certain benefits are based on years of service andor age at retirement the plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 contributory for most employees who retire after 1992 and we provide no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003 

  

we made benefit payments of 64 million in 2010 compared with 71 million in 2009 the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent 2011 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by less than 1 million and the december 31 2010 benefit liability would increase by about 17 million 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage health care cost trend rate is expected to be 71 percent in 2011 and to gradually decline to 50 percent in 2015 and thereafter see item 8 note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate 

  

retained insurable risks 

  

selected insurable risks are retained primarily those related to property damage workers’ compensation and product automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events principally related to workers’ compensation and automobile liability are based upon undiscounted loss development factors 

  

property and depreciation 

  

estimating the useful lives of property plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment and actual lives may differ from these estimates changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these longlived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines future sales volumes growth rates for selling prices and costs alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset and eventual disposition undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount the determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple probabilityweighted cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes are used to estimate fair value 

  

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge actual outcomes may differ from the estimates for example if our products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and additional impairment charges may be recognized 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value it has been determined that our 34 billion of goodwill is not impaired 

  

we have no significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2010 we have intangible assets with finite useful lives with a gross carrying amount of approximately 507 million and a net carrying amount of about 276 million these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value based on discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

  

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities “vie” 

  

the primary beneficiary of a vie is required to consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary of a vie is an enterprise that has an interest in a vie that provides the enterprise with the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie and the obligation to absorb significant losses or the right to receive significant benefits of the vie the primary beneficiary of a vie is required to be determined using a qualitative analysis considering such factors as the vie’s purpose and design the involvement of each interest holder in the vie and the risks and benefits the vie was designed to create and pass to interest holders an enterprise is required to perform ongoing reassessments to determine if it must consolidate a vie 

  

we exercise judgment in performing the ongoing qualitative primary beneficiary assessments for our interests in the vies described in item 8 notes 2 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

  

as of december 31 2010 we have recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling 974 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 240 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 734 million as of december 31 2009 the net deferred tax asset was 643 million these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2010 us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 73 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

were remitted as dividends were lent to us or a us affiliate or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate 

  

we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes the item is included in our income tax returns where treatment of a position is uncertain a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations our us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2007 irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2001 we have various federal income tax return positions in administrative appeals or litigation for 1999 and 2002 to 2007 we currently believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

the outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against us is subject to uncertainty an estimated loss contingency is accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies 

  

legal matters 

  

we have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of which individually or in the aggregate in our opinion is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

business outlook 

  

pulp  tissue restructuring 

  

on january 21 2011 we initiated a pulp and tissue restructuring plan in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and kc professional businesses the restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 and will involve the streamlining sale or closure of 5 to 6 of our manufacturing facilities around the world in conjunction with these actions we will be exiting certain nonstrategic products primarily nonbranded offerings and transferring some production to lowercost facilities in order to improve overall profitability and returns facilities that will be impacted by the restructuring include our pulp and tissue facility in everett washington and the two facilities in australia that manufacture pulp and tissue 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

the restructuring plan will commence in the first quarter of 2011 and is expected to be completed by december 31 2012 the restructuring is expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately 400 million to 600 million before tax 280 million to 420 million after tax over that period we anticipate that the charges will fall into the following categories and approximate dollar ranges workforce reduction costs 50 million to 100 million incremental depreciation 300 million to 400 million and other associated costs 50 million to 100 million cash costs related to the streamlining of operations sale or closure relocation of equipment severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 25 percent to 50 percent of the charges noncash charges will consist primarily of incremental depreciation 

  

as a result of the restructuring we expect that by 2013 annual net sales will be reduced by 250 million to 300 million and operating profit will increase by at least 75 million most of the restructuring will impact the consumer tissue business segment 

  

2011 operating results 

  

we expect the economic environment to continue to be difficult in 2011 we intend to continue to focus on leveraging our strong brands bringing innovations to market and pursuing targeted growth initiatives while reducing costs and maximizing cash flow we believe that the benefits of sales growth and cost savings will be partially offset by charges related to the restructuring plan described above inflation in key cost inputs planned increases in marketing spending and increased interest expense we expect to continue our program of share repurchases in 2011 and we have increased the amount of our regular quarterly dividend for 2011

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

as a multinational enterprise we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

  

presented below is a description of our risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect management’s view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of our commodity price risk 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs 

  

as of december 31 2010 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 39 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2010 rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the us dollar changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the us dollar applied to our bolivardenominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change at december 31 2010 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 10 million there are no viable options for hedging this exposure 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

as of december 31 2010 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders’ equity by approximately 810 million these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2010 exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2010 the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 20 percent variablerate debt and 80 percent fixedrate debt 

  

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2010 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 182 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variablerate debt with respect to variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

we are subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand on a worldwide basis we currently supply less than 10 percent of our virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations this supply will be outsourced as we exit our pulp manufacturing operations as part of our pulp and tissue restructuring see item 8 note 19 for additional information as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

our energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition we are subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in our manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy

as can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments even though estimates and judgments are used measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report these measures include an effective controloriented environment in which the internal audit function plays an important role and an audit committee of the board of directors that oversees the financial reporting process the consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp during its audits deloitte  touche llp was given unrestricted access to all financial records including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and our board of directors and all committees of our board management believes that all representations made to the independent registered public accountants during their audits were valid and appropriate

our code of conduct among other things contains policies for conducting business affairs in a lawful and ethical manner everywhere we do business for avoiding potential conflicts of interest and for preserving confidentiality of information and business ideas internal controls have been implemented to provide reasonable assurance that the code of conduct is followed 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition use or disposition this system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and our board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and safeguarding of our assets this system is supported with written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial statement preparation and such asset safeguarding 

  

we have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 in making this assessment we used the criteria described in “internal control—integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2010 our internal control over financial reporting is effective

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

kimberlyclark corporation 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of kimberlyclark corporation and subsidiaries the “corporation” as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control— integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the corporation as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 and our report dated february 23 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10k or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission could adversely affect the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results 

  

increased pricing pressure intense competition for sales of the corporation’s products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

the corporation competes in intensely competitive markets against wellknown branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in the corporation’s competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitive reaction some of the corporation’s major competitors have undergone consolidation which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry this consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

in addition the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of the corporation’s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the corporation these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the corporation the corporation’s ability to develop new products is affected by whether it can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences develop and fund technological innovations and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising marketing timely launching and selling its products

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

the corporation’s products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us europe and australia the corporation is increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining power than does the corporation they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability the corporation may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if the corporation loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease the corporation’s business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

  

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters power outages labor strikes governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change concerns and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in the corporation’s tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets recycled fiber accounts for approximately 32 percent of the corporation and its equity companies’ overall fiber requirements 

  

increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations 

  

a number of the corporation’s products such as diapers training and youth pants incontinence care products disposable wipes and various health care products contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials

unfavorable economic conditions including the impact of recessions slow economic growth and credit market disruptions in the united states and certain foreign countries may continue to negatively affect the corporation’s business and financial results these economic conditions could negatively impact 

  

   

   

   

   

   

ongoing volatility in global commodity currency and financial markets resulted in uncertainty in the business environment in 2009 which is expected to continue into 2010 the corporation relies on access to the credit markets specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets to provide supplemental funding for its operations although the corporation has not experienced a disruption in its ability to access the credit markets it is possible that the corporation may have difficulty accessing the credit markets in the future which may disrupt its businesses or further increase the corporation’s cost of funding its operations 

  

prolonged recessions slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue margins and earnings 

  

the corporation’s international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk and currency restrictions which may adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries the corporation’s results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries 

  

the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations including fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency restrictions adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers risks of expropriation difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and

in addition intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic political and competitive environments in latin america eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation’s sales growth and earnings potential see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the corporation’s success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or form successful business alliances and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form these alliances in addition there can be no assurance that the corporation’s products will be accepted in any particular market 

  

the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar a portion of the exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts 

  

translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollarbased input costs for operations outside the us there can be no assurance that the corporation will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation’s ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

  

the corporation continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by achieving cost reductions in its operations in addition the corporation expects ongoing cost savings from its organization optimization initiative and ongoing continuous improvement activities the corporation anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from previous reductions of its worldwide salaried workforce reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” if the corporation cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on the corporation’s relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results

the corporation may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

moreover future acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness exposure to contingent liabilities or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets all of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

if we are unable to hire develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce it could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our strategy includes a focus on hiring developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse skilled workforce could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recruit develop and retain the key personnel that we need 

  

pending litigation administrative actions and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect on the corporation 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws including intellectual property laws in addition the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions 

  

the corporation’s sales and results of operations also may be adversely affected by new legal requirements including proposed health care reform legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty for example new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to the corporation directly for its compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials 

  

although management believes that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements will be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

the corporation obtains certain manufactured products and administrative services from third parties if the thirdparty providers fail to satisfactorily perform our operations could be adversely impacted 

  

third parties manufacture some of the corporation’s products and provide certain administrative services disruptions or delays at the thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to regional economic business environmental or political events or information technology system failures or military actions or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact the corporation’s operations sales payments to the corporation’s vendors employees and others and the corporation’s ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis administrative functions transferred to thirdparty service providers include certain information technology

because the cumulative inflation in venezuela for the preceding three years was more than 100 percent effective january 1 2010 the corporation determined that results for this operation would be accounted for as highly inflationary on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government devalued its currency and established a multiple exchange rate structure as a result of the devaluation the corporation anticipates recording a onetime after tax charge to remeasure the subsidiary’s local currency net monetary asset position into us dollars the corporation is currently evaluating the rate at which the devaluation will be measured and 2010 results will be translated into us dollars the corporation estimates the range of the onetime aftertax impact of the devaluation to be 60 million to 90 million based on a rate of 43 to 60 bolivars per us dollar this charge will be recorded in the first quarter of 2010 at the stated range of rates the corporation estimates that the ongoing effect of the devaluation will not be material to the corporation’s 2010 net income

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

reporting period the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals pension and other postretirement benefits retained insurable risks useful lives for depreciation and amortization future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets the qualitative and quantitative analyses of variability used to determine the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments and loss contingencies these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

promotion and rebate accruals 

  

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by the corporation’s customers to promote the corporation’s products promotion accruals as of december 31 2009 and 2008 were 364 million and 321 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2009 and 2008 were 365 million and 261 million respectively 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

pension benefits 

  

the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in these countries nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 251 million in 2009 compared with 97 million for 2008 pension expense included curtailment charges of about 21 million in 2009 related to the freeze of the corporation’s us defined benefit pension plans and special pension benefits related to the strategic cost reductions of about 5 million in 2008 pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 817 percent in 2009 compared with 823 percent in 2008 and will be 796 percent in 2010 the expected longterm rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis in setting this assumption the corporation considers a number of factors including projected future 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

returns by asset class current asset allocation and historical longterm market performance as part of the factors related to historical market performance the corporation considered the range of compounded annual returns for 15 rolling 15year and 20year periods through 2009 relative to each plan’s current asset allocation 

  

the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the principal plans was 847 percent in 2009 compared with 848 percent in 2008 and will be 819 percent in 2010 the expected longterm rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 65 percent with equity managers with expected longterm rates of return ranging from 9 to 10 percent and about 35 percent with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return ranging from 6 to 7 percent actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate longterm rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary 

  

pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2009 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately 22 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns or ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” as required  

  

the discount or settlement rates used to determine the present values of the corporation’s future us and canadian pension obligations at december 31 2009 were based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years each year’s expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rates for the us and canadian pension obligations for the uk plans discount rates were established using the yield on a uk bond index comprised of high quality corporate debt securities with the yield adjusted for duration differences between the index and the pension obligations and for securities in the index recently downgraded below high quality the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans decreased to 588 percent at december 31 2009 from 647 percent at december 31 2008 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 160 million in 2010 the decrease in estimated pension expense for 2010 from 251 million incurred in 2009 reflects substantially higher plan assets at december 31 2009 the 2010 estimate is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 819 percent a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 588 percent and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2010 will depend on future investment performance the corporation’s contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

  

if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 10 million in 2010 if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 7 million and the december 31 2009 pension liability would increase by about 157 million 

  

the fair value of the assets in the corporation’s defined benefit plans was 42 billion and 31 billion at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively the projected benefit obligations of the defined 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately 12 billion and 19 billion at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively on a consolidated basis the corporation contributed about 845 million to its pension plans in 2009 compared with 129 million in 2008 in addition the corporation made direct benefit payments of 25 million in 2009 compared to 14 million in 2008 the corporation currently anticipates contributing about 240 million to its pension plans in 2010 

  

the methodology for determining the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation’s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

other postretirement benefits 

  

substantially all us retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans certain benefits are based on years of service andor age at retirement the plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 contributory for most employees who retire after 1992 and the corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003 

  

the corporation made benefit payments of 71 million in 2009 compared with 73 million in 2008 the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent 2010 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by less than 1 million and the december 31 2009 benefit liability would increase by about 17 million 

  

the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including the corporation’s recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage health care cost trend rate is expected to be 71 percent in 2010 71 percent in 2011 and to gradually decline to 50 percent in 2015 and thereafter see item 8 note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate 

  

retained insurable risks 

  

selected insurable risks are retained primarily those related to property damage workers’ compensation and product automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events principally related to workers’ compensation and automobile liability are based upon undiscounted loss development factors 

  

property and depreciation 

  

estimating the useful lives of property plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment and actual lives may differ from these estimates changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these longlived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines future sales volumes growth rates for selling prices and costs alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount the determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple probabilityweighted cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a riskfree rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

  

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge actual outcomes may differ from the estimates for example if the corporation’s products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and additional impairment charges may be recognized 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of the corporation’s businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated 

  

if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and as the fair value of each reporting unit was significantly in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value it has been determined that the corporation’s 33 billion of goodwill is not impaired 

  

the corporation has no significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2009 the corporation has other intangible assets with finite useful lives with a gross carrying amount of approximately 505 million and a net carrying amount of about 297 million these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value based on discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

  

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities “vie” 

  

the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities is required to be determined using a qualitative analysis to identify the risks in the vie that cause variability and then to determine the variability that the vie is designed to create and pass along to its participants the participant that absorbs the majority of the variability is the

continued 

 

  

primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie if the qualitative analysis is inconclusive a quantitative analysis is required to estimate the probable future cash flows of the vie using a computer simulation model and determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary both the qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis require the exercise of significant management judgment 

  

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

  

as of december 31 2009 the corporation had recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling 816 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 225 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 591 million as of december 31 2008 the net deferred tax asset was 420 million these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets many factors are considered including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2009 us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 58 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate 

  

the corporation accrues net liabilities for current income taxes for potential assessments which at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 were 391 million and 332 million respectively the accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the resolution of these positions these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations the corporation’s us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2005 irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2001 refund actions are pending with the irs for the years 1999 through 2005 management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

loss contingencies 

  

the outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against the corporation is subject to uncertainty an estimated loss contingency is accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

legal matters 

  

the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of which individually or in the aggregate in management’s opinion is likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

new accounting standards 

  

see item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on the corporation’s consolidated financial statements 

  

business outlook 

  

the corporation is planning for a slow and modest economic recovery in 2010 the corporation believes that expected benefits from sales growth cost savings and benefits from stronger currency exchange rates will more than offset inflation in key cost inputs and planned increases in marketing spending in 2010 the corporation intends to continue to focus on its targeted growth initiatives innovation programs and research and customer development capabilities while reducing costs and maximizing cash flow the corporation has resumed share repurchases in 2010 and increased the amount of its regular quarterly dividend 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain matters discussed in this form 10k or related documents a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference concerning among other things the business outlook including economic conditions sales levels anticipated currency rates and exchange risk anticipated impact of acquisitions cost savings changes in finished product selling prices anticipated raw material and energy costs anticipated benefits related to the organization optimization initiative cash flow levels dividend amounts anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and anticipated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation’s results will be as estimated 

  

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices and availability of the corporation’s raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation’s products energy costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business could impact the realization of such estimates 

  

the factors described under item 1a risk factors in this form 10k or in our other securities and exchange commission filings among others could cause the corporation’s future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

as a multinational enterprise the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions the corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

  

presented below is a description of the corporation’s risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect management’s view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of the corporation’s commodity price risk 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of the corporation’s exposure the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs 

  

as of december 31 2009 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 29 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2009 rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows this analysis does not include the impacts of the changes in january 2010 of the venezuelan bolivar described previously in item 7 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2009 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation’s foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

stockholders’ equity by approximately 622 million these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2009 exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position because they would not affect the corporation’s cash flow 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2009 the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 23 percent variablerate debt and 77 percent fixedrate debt 

  

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation’s financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2009 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 190 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation’s current level of variablerate debt with respect to variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the corporation is subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

the corporation’s energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in its manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation’s risk management policy

as can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments even though estimates and judgments are used measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report these measures include an effective controloriented environment in which the internal audit function plays an important role and an audit committee of the board of directors that oversees the financial reporting process the consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp during its audits deloitte  touche llp was given unrestricted access to all financial records including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and the board of directors and all committees of the board management believes that all representations made to the independent registered public accountants during their audits were valid and appropriate 

  

audit committee oversight and the corporation’s code of conduct 

  

the audit committee of the board of directors which is composed solely of independent directors assists the board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting auditing and financial reporting practices of the corporation the audits of its consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting the audit committee reviews with the auditors any relationships that may affect their objectivity and independence the audit committee also reviews with management the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm the quality and adequacy of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting including compliance matters related to the corporation’s code of conduct and the results of the internal and external audits the audit committee has reviewed and recommended that the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report be included in the form 10k for filing with the securities and exchange commission

the corporation’s code of conduct among other things contains policies for conducting business affairs in a lawful and ethical manner everywhere it does business for avoiding potential conflicts of interest and for preserving confidentiality of information and business ideas internal controls have been implemented to provide reasonable assurance that the code of conduct is followed 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition use or disposition this system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and safeguarding of the corporation’s assets this system is supported with written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial statement preparation and such asset safeguarding 

  

the corporation has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 in making this assessment it used the criteria described in “internal control—integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2009 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

kimberlyclark corporation 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of kimberlyclark corporation and subsidiaries the “corporation” as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of the corporation as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 and our report dated february 24 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10k or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission could adversely affect the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results 

  

global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect the corporation’s business and financial results 

  

unfavorable economic conditions including the impact of recessions in the united states and throughout the world may continue to negatively affect the corporation’s business and financial results these economic conditions could negatively impact i consumer demand for our products including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lowercost options such as private label products ii the mix of our products’ sales iii our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers and iv the ability of certain suppliers to fill our orders for raw materials or other goods and services a prolonged recession could result in decreased revenue margins and earnings 

  

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters power outages labor strikes and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in the corporation’s tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets recycled fiber accounts for approximately 32 percent of the corporation and its equity companies’ overall fiber requirements 

  

increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations 

  

a number of the corporation’s products such as diapers training and youth pants incontinence care products disposable wipes and various health care products contain certain materials which are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

the corporation’s manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels 

  

to ensure that it uses all forms of energy costeffectively the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites the corporation’s contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration the corporation’s energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation’s risk management policy 

  

increased pricing pressure and intense competition for sales of the corporation’s products could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

the corporation competes in intensely competitive markets against wellknown branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in the corporation’s competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitive reaction some of the corporation’s major competitors have undergone consolidation which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry this consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

in addition the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of the corporation’s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the corporation these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the corporation can the corporation’s ability to develop new products is affected by whether it can develop and fund technological innovations receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising marketing and selling its products 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

the corporation’s products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us and europe the corporation is increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining power than does the corporation they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability the corporation may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if the corporation loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease the corporation’s business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation’s efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

  

the corporation continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by accelerating cost reductions in its operations in addition the corporation expects to obtain ongoing cost savings from its recently completed streamlining of manufacturing and administrative operations the corporation further anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” if the corporation cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these plans have on the corporation’s relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

the corporation’s sales may not occur as estimated 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences estimate sales of new products estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation’s products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses as a result the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales 

  

the corporation’s international operations are subject to foreign market risks including foreign exchange risk and currency restrictions which may adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries the corporation’s results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries 

  

the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations including fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency restrictions adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

in addition intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic political and competitive environments in latin america and developing and other countries in eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation’s sales growth and earnings potential see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the corporation’s success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form these alliances in addition there can be no assurance that the corporation’s products will be accepted in any particular market 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar a portion of the exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies is systematically hedged through foreign currency forward and swap contracts 

  

translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged weaker foreign currency exchange rates reduce the potential benefit of forecasted declines in dollarbased input costs for operations outside the us there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

the current credit market disruptions and recession in the united states and certain foreign countries may adversely affect our business 

  

during 2008 unprecedented volatility in global commodity currency and financial markets resulted in a high level of uncertainty in the business environment which is expected to continue into 2009 the corporation relies on access to the credit markets specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets to provide supplemental funding for its operations although the corporation has not experienced a disruption in its ability to access the credit markets there is no assurance that the credit markets will not deteriorate further it is possible that the corporation may have difficulty accessing the credit markets in the future which may disrupt its businesses or further increase the corporation’s cost of funding its operations additionally the current uncertainty in global economic conditions resulting from the recent disruptions in credit markets and other factors including recession in the united states and recessions in various foreign markets where the corporation operates may adversely affect our sales and results of operations if the current situation deteriorates significantly our business could be further negatively impacted including reduced demand for our products or supplier customer or creditor disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets and other economic factors 

  

the corporation may acquire new product lines or businesses and may have difficulties integrating future acquisitions or may not realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions 

  

the corporation may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from future acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all any inability by us to integrate and manage any acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in trade promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity moreover future acquisitions by us could result in our incurring substantial additional indebtedness being exposed to contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets all of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

pending litigation administrative actions and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect on the corporation 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws including intellectual property laws in addition the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

corporation and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

the corporation obtains certain manufactured products and administrative services from third parties if the thirdparty providers fail to satisfactorily perform our operations could be adversely impacted 

  

as part of the corporation’s global business plan a number of administrative functions have been transferred to thirdparty service providers those functions include certain information technology finance and accounting sourcing and supply management and human resources services although moving these administrative functions to thirdparty service providers is expected to improve certain capabilities and lower the corporation’s cost of operations the corporation could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services additionally third parties manufacture some of the corporation’s products disruptions or delays at the thirdparty manufacturers or service providers due to regional economic business environmental or political events or information technology system failures or military actions or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform could adversely impact the corporation’s operations sales payments to the corporation’s vendors employees and others and the corporation’s ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis

in europe personal care net sales were even with the prior year as favorable currency effects offset lower sales volumes and net selling prices sales volumes of huggies diapers in the corporation’s four core markets—the uk france italy and spain—declined about 4 percent from the prior year 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales increased almost 17 percent driven by a more than 10 percent increase in sales volumes the growth in sales volumes was broadbased with particular strength throughout latin america and in south korea russia turkey and china increased net selling prices and favorable product mix added about 4 percent and 2 percent respectively to the net sales increase unfavorable currency effects in south korea were offset by favorable effects in other countries primarily in brazil and israel 

  

   

in europe consumer tissue net sales increased almost 4 percent on nearly 3 percent higher net selling prices a 1 percent improvement in product mix and more than 2 percent favorable currency effects tempered by a decline in sales volumes of about 2 percent the lower sales volumes were primarily due to reduced sales of andrex and scottex bathroom tissue and kleenex facial tissue in response to higher net selling prices and a slowdown in category sales particularly in the uk 

  

consumer tissue net sales in the developing and emerging markets increased nearly 13 percent during 2008 the corporation raised prices in most markets to recover higher raw materials costs and drove improvements in mix with more differentiated valueadded products strategies that resulted in higher net selling prices of about 10 percent and better product mix of more than 2 percent sales volumes were even with last year for the year currency effects were neutral as favorable effects earlier in the year were offset by the dramatic changes in currency rates in the fourth quarter of 2008

commentary 

  

2007 versus 2006 

  

   

   

net sales of personal care products in europe increased about 11 percent principally due to favorable currency effects higher sales volumes of more than 2 percent were offset by lower net selling prices the sales volume gains reflect higher sales of huggies diapers and baby wipes across the region including a more than 2 percent volume gain for huggies diapers in the four core markets—united kingdom france italy and spain the lower net selling prices were due to meeting competitive promotional activity 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales increased nearly 21 percent driven by a more than 13 percent increase in sales volumes the growth in sales volumes was broadbased with particular strength throughout most of latin america and in south korea china and russia favorable currency effects primarily in australia and brazil added about 6 percent to the higher net sales while net selling prices were about even with last year 

  

   

in europe net sales of consumer tissue products increased approximately 9 percent principally due to favorable currency exchange rates improved product mix was negated by an overall sales volume decline of about 1 percent that resulted from the corporation’s 2006 decision to shed lowmargin business following the sale or closure of certain facilities in the region sales volume increases for andrex bathroom tissue and kleenex facial tissue were not sufficient to offset the withdrawal from the lowmargin business net selling prices remained about the same as in the prior year 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales increased more than 12 percent about half of the increase was due to favorable currency effects improved product mix of nearly 3 percent was tempered 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

by lower sales volumes of slightly more than 1 percent net selling prices increased almost 5 percent as selling prices were raised during the year in most developing and emerging markets in response to higher raw material costs

strategic cost reduction plan 

  

in july 2005 the corporation authorized a multiyear plan to further improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and strategic cost reductions aimed at streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations primarily in north america and europe 

  

the strategic cost reductions commenced in the third quarter of 2005 and were completed by december 31 2008 the strategic cost reductions resulted in cumulative charges of 880 million before tax or 610 million after tax 

  

since the inception of the strategic cost reductions a net workforce reduction of 5800 has occurred as of december 31 2008 charges have been recorded related to the cost reduction initiatives for 23 facilities including 3 facilities which have been closed and are being marketed for sale 

  

for the full year of 2008 yearoveryear pretax savings of nearly 110 million were realized bringing the cumulative annual total to approximately 335 million since the plan’s inception including projected yearoveryear savings of about 50 million in 2009 total annual savings from the plan are now expected to reach 385 million 

  

see item 8 note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for detail on costs incurred for the plan 

  

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net for 2008 includes costs for a legal judgment and the refinancing of the dealer remarketable securities see item 8 note 6 to the consolidated financial statements partially offset by favorable settlement of a valueadded tax matter in latin america a gain of 16 million for the settlement of litigation related to prior years’ operations in latin america is included in 2007 in addition currency transaction losses included in this line item were about 5 million higher in 2008 than in 2007

consolidated operating profit increased 514 million or 245 percent lower charges for the strategic cost reduction plan increased operating profit by 377 million these charges are not included in the business segments in addition cost savings generated by the plan totaled approximately 105 million during 2007 other factors affecting the comparison with 2006 were savings of nearly 160 million for the corporation’s focused on reducing costs everywhere program higher sales volumes and increased net selling prices partially offsetting these improvements were raw materials cost inflation of almost 350 million increased strategic marketing expenses of about 50 million and higher general and administrative expenses the increased general and administrative expenses were to a large extent in support of growth in the developing and emerging markets operating profit as a percent of net sales increased to 143 percent from 126 percent in 2006 

  

   

operating profit in north america increased nearly 13 percent primarily on the strength of higher sales volumes cost savings and slightly higher net selling prices offset the effect of raw materials cost inflation increased operating profit in europe was driven by cost savings and higher sales volumes despite lower net selling prices operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased more than 25 percent on sales volume growth and cost savings that more than offset increased marketing and general and administrative expenses 

  

   

in north america operating profit declined more than 15 percent because higher net selling prices were more than offset by raw materials cost inflation primarily pulp costs the costs of product improvements and higher manufacturing costs operating profit in europe increased due to cost savings and favorable currency effects tempered by raw materials cost inflation and higher marketing and general and administrative expenses in the developing and emerging markets operating profit declined slightly as net selling price gains were more than offset by increased pulp costs higher manufacturing costs and increased general and administrative expenses 

  

   

   

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net for 2007 includes a gain of 16 million for the previously mentioned settlement of litigation in latin america currency transaction losses included in this line item were about 10 million lower in 2007 than in 2006 in addition gains on dispositions of facilities in 2007 as part of the strategic cost reduction plan were about 14 million compared with costs of 8 million in 2006

the corporation will fund its defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expects to contribute 530 million to these plans in 2009 this amount is not included in the above table 

  

the above table does not include future payments that the corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions including expected future service to project the future obligations based upon those projections the corporation anticipates making annual payments for these obligations within a range from approximately 85 million in 2009 to more than 90 million by 2018 

  

as of december 31 2008 the corporation has accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions these liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 

  

deferred taxes minority owners’ interests and payments for pension plan benefits are also not included in the table 

  

a consolidated financing subsidiary has issued two classes of redeemable preferred securities the holder of the securities can elect to have the subsidiary redeem the first class in december 2011 and the second class in december 2014 and each sevenyear anniversary thereafter management currently anticipates that these securities will not be redeemed at the next redemption dates and therefore they are not included in the above table in the event that the holder of the securities does elect to have its preferred securities redeemed at the next respective redemption dates the corporation would be required to pay approximately 500 million in 2011 and approximately 500 million in 2014 see item 8 note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these securities

variable interest entities 

  

the corporation has interests in the financing and real estate entities discussed in item 8 notes 2 7 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements all of which are subject to the requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities—an interpretation of arb 51 “fin 46r” the entities described in item 8 notes 2 and 7 are consolidated

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the corporation’s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals pension and other postretirement benefits retained insurable risks useful lives for depreciation and amortization future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets the qualitative and quantitative analyses of variability used to determine the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments and loss contingencies the corporation’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

promotion and rebate accruals 

  

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the corporation’s products promotion accruals as of december 31 2008 and 2007 were 321 million and 348 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2008 and 2007 were 261 million and 253 million respectively 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

pension benefits 

  

the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in such countries nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 97 million in 2008 compared with 120 million for 2007 pension expense included incremental costs of about 5 million and 8 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively for special pension benefits related to the strategic cost reductions pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 823 percent in 2008 compared with 827 percent in 2007 and will be 817 percent in 2009 the expected longterm rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis in setting this assumption the corporation considers a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class current asset allocation and historical longterm market performance as part of the factors related to historical market performance the corporation considered the range of compounded annual returns for 15 rolling 15year and 20year periods through 2008 relative to each plan’s current asset allocation 

  

the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the principal plans was 848 percent in 2008 compared with 850 percent in 2007 and will be 847 percent in 2009 the expected longterm rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers with expected longterm rates of return ranging from 9 to 10 percent and about 30 percent with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return ranging from 6 to 7 percent actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate longterm rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary 

  

pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2008 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately 22 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns or ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” determined under sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions 

  

the discount or settlement rates used to determine the present values of the corporation’s future us and canadian pension obligations at december 31 2008 were based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years each year’s expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rates for the us and canadian pension obligations for the uk plans discount rates were established using the yield on a uk bond index comprised of high quality corporate debt securities with the yield adjusted for duration differences between the index and the pension obligations and for securities in the index recently downgraded below high quality the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans increased to 647 percent at december 31 2008 from 620 percent at december 31 2007 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate 295 million in 2009 the increase in estimated pension expense for 2009 from 97 million incurred in 2008 reflects substantially lower plan assets at december 31 2008 and the effect of actuarial losses the 2009 estimate is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 847 percent a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 647 percent and various other assumptions pension

expense beyond 2009 will depend on future investment performance the corporation’s contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

  

if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 7 million in 2009 if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 11 million and the december 31 2008 pension liability would increase by about 133 million 

  

the fair value of the assets in the corporation’s defined benefit plans was 31 billion and 47 billion at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately 19 billion and 08 billion at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively on a consolidated basis the corporation contributed about 129 million to its pension plans in 2008 compared with 98 million in 2007 in addition the corporation made direct benefit payments of 14 million in 2008 compared to 15 million in 2007 the corporation currently anticipates contributing about 530 million to its pension plans in 2009 

  

the methodology for determining the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation’s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

other postretirement benefits 

  

substantially all us retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans certain benefits are based on years of service andor age at retirement the plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 and contributory for most employees who retire after 1992 except that the corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003 

  

the corporation made benefit payments of 73 million in 2008 compared with 77 million in 2007 the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent 2009 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by less than 1 million and the december 31 2008 benefit liability would increase by about 16 million 

  

the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including the corporation’s recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage health care cost trend rate is expected to be 75 percent in 2009 65 percent in 2010 and to gradually decline to 52 percent in 2012 and thereafter see item 8 note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate 

  

retained insurable risks 

  

selected insurable risks are retained primarily those related to property damage workers’ compensation and product automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events principally related to workers’ compensation and automobile liability are based upon undiscounted loss development factors

property and depreciation 

  

estimating the useful lives of property plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment and actual lives may differ from these estimates changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate property plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such longlived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines future sales volumes growth rates for selling prices and costs alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount the determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple probabilityweighted cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a riskfree rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

  

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans including the strategic cost reduction plan and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge actual outcomes may differ from the estimates for example if the corporation’s products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and additional impairment charges may be recognized 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of the corporation’s businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the corporation’s annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and it has been determined that its 27 billion of goodwill is not impaired 

  

the corporation has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2008 the corporation has other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately 307 million and a net carrying amount of about 121 million these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value based on discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

  

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities “vie”

as of december 31 2008 the corporation had recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling 725 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 305 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 420 million as of december 31 2007 the net deferred tax asset was 414 million these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets the corporation considers many factors including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence the corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2008 in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 23 accounting for income taxes special areas us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 56 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate 

  

the corporation accrues net liabilities for current income taxes for potential assessments which at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 were 332 million and 323 million respectively the accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the resolution of these positions in accordance with the provisions of fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement 109 accounting for income taxes these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations the corporation’s us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2005 irs assessments

of additional taxes have been paid through 2001 refund actions are pending with the irs for the years 1999 through 2005 management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

loss contingencies 

  

the outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against the corporation is subject to uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies requires that an estimated loss contingency be accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies 

  

legal matters 

  

the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of which individually or in the aggregate in management’s opinion is likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

new accounting standards 

  

see item 8 note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on the corporation’s financial statements 

  

business outlook 

  

the unfavorable global economic environment continues to adversely affect the corporation’s business and financial results making it more challenging to predict results in the nearterm the corporation believes that weakness in foreign currencies and higher pension expense resulting from negative returns in global equity markets in 2008 will negatively affect the corporation’s 2009 results while commodity costs are anticipated to moderate as compared to 2008 expected weaker currency exchange rates would reduce the potential benefits of lower commodity costs based on anticipated economic and competitive conditions the corporation expects to generate sufficient improvement in other aspects of its business operations in 2009 to substantially offset the negative effects from the higher pension expense and currency transaction losses in 2009 the corporation intends to continue to focus on its marketing and innovation programs the corporation also intends to accelerate cost reductions in its operations to improve its competitive position and to continue to focus on its cash flow and financial condition 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain matters discussed in this form 10k or related documents a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference concerning among other things the business outlook including new product introductions cost savings anticipated benefits related to the strategic cost reduction plan anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and anticipated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation’s results will be as estimated 

  

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices and availability of the corporation’s raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation’s products energy costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business could impact the realization of such estimates 

  

the factors described under item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k or in our other securities and exchange commission filings among others could cause the corporation’s future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

as a multinational enterprise the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions the corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions 

  

presented below is a description of the corporation’s risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect management’s view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of the corporation’s commodity price risk 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of the corporation’s exposure the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

as of december 31 2008 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 43 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2008 rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2008 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation’s foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders’ equity by approximately 462 million these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2008 exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position because they would not affect the corporation’s cash flow 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2008 the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 20 percent variablerate debt and 80 percent fixedrate debt 

  

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation’s financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2008 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 200 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation’s current level of variablerate debt with respect to commercial paper and other variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the corporation is subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

the corporation’s energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in its manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation’s risk management policy

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

kimberlyclark corporation 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of kimberlyclark corporation and subsidiaries the “corporation” as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10k or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission could adversely affect the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results 

  

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by such events as natural disasters power outages labor strikes and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in the corporation’s tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets recycled fiber accounts for approximately 31 percent of the corporation and its equity companies’ overall fiber requirements 

  

increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

a number of the corporation’s products such as diapers training and youth pants incontinence care products disposable wipes and various health care products contain certain materials which are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

the corporation’s manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels 

  

to ensure that it uses all forms of energy costeffectively the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites the corporation’s contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration the corporation’s energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation’s risk management policy 

  

increased pricing pressure and intense competition for sales of the corporation’s products could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

the corporation competes in intensely competitive markets against wellknown branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in the corporation’s competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitive reaction some of the corporation’s major competitors have undergone consolidation which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry such consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results in addition the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of the corporation’s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the corporation these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the corporation can the corporation’s ability to develop new products is affected by whether it can develop and fund technological innovations receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising marketing and selling its products 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

the corporation’s products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us and europe the corporation is increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining power than does the corporation they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability the corporation may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on

continued 

 

  

access to shelf space delisting of our products additional requirements related to safety environmental social and other sustainability issues and other conditions if the corporation loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease the corporation’s business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation’s efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

  

the corporation began its competitive improvement initiatives in the third quarter of 2005 to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in addition the corporation anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments if the corporation cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions included in its competitive improvement initiatives or other cost savings plans the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these initiatives have on the corporation’s relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

the corporation’s sales may not occur as estimated 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences estimate sales of new products estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation’s products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses as a result the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales 

  

the corporation’s international operations are subject to foreign market risks which may adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 39 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries the corporation’s results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries 

  

the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations including fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

in addition intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic political and competitive environments in latin america and developing countries in eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation’s sales growth and earnings potential the corporation’s success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form such alliances in addition there can be no assurance that the corporation’s products will be accepted in any particular market the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies are systematically hedged through foreign currency forward and swap contracts 

  

part i 

continued 

 

  

translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

the corporation may acquire new product lines or businesses and may have difficulties integrating future acquisitions or may not realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions 

  

the corporation may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses personnel turnover and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future in addition we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from future acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or at all any inability by us to integrate and manage any acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in trade promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity moreover future acquisitions by us could result in our incurring substantial additional indebtedness being exposed to contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets all of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

pending litigation and administrative actions could have an adverse effect on the corporation 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws including intellectual property laws in addition the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in such actions the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with certainty although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

the corporation obtains certain administrative services from third parties which previously were provided by employees of the corporation if the thirdparty service providers fail to satisfactorily perform their administrative services our operations could be adversely impacted 

  

as part of the corporation’s global business plan a number of administrative functions have been transferred to thirdparty service providers those functions include certain information technology finance and accounting sourcing and supply management and human resources services although moving these administrative functions to thirdparty service providers is expected to improve certain capabilities and lower the corporation’s cost of operations the corporation could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services disruptions or delays at the thirdparty service providers due to regional economic business environmental or political events or information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact the corporation’s operations payments to the corporation’s vendors employees and others and the corporation’s ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis

continued 

 

  

   

aggressive competitive actions in 2006 and 2007 have required increased promotional spending to support new product introductions and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the corporation’s products in the market we expect competition to continue to be intense in 2008 

  

   

   

   

overview of 2007 results 

  

the corporation experienced significant raw materials cost inflation in 2007 as well as continued competitive pressures 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

results of operations and related information 

  

this section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2007 results of operations this discussion and analysis compares 2007 results to 2006 and 2006 results to 2005 each discussion focuses first on consolidated results and then the results of each reportable business segment

by geographic area 

  

   

commentary 

  

2007 versus 2006 

  

   

consolidated net sales increased 91 percent from 2006 sales volumes rose 4 percent driven by growth in the personal care and kc professional  other segments net selling prices increased 1 percent primarily on higher net selling prices for consumer tissue favorable currency effects primarily in europe australia and brazil and improved product mix added about 3 percent and 1 percent respectively to the increase 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

   

in north america net sales increased nearly 8 percent primarily on the strength of increased sales volumes product innovations spurred volume growth with a doubledigit gain for huggies baby wipes high singledigit growth for huggies diapers and mid singledigit increases for the corporation’s child care and incontinence care brands child care sales volumes benefited from the late third quarter introduction of goodnites sleep boxers and sleep shorts a unique offering in the youth pants category meanwhile sales volumes of kotex feminine care products were below yearago levels net selling prices increased about 1 percent 

  

net sales in europe increased about 11 percent principally due to favorable currency effects higher sales volumes of more than 2 percent were offset by lower net selling prices the sales volume gains reflect higher sales of huggies diapers and baby wipes across the region including a more than 2 percent volume gain for huggies diapers in the four core markets—united kingdom france italy and spain the lower net selling prices were due to meeting competitive promotional activity 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales increased nearly 21 percent driven by a more than 13 percent increase in sales volumes the growth in sales volumes was broadbased with particular strength throughout most of latin america and in south korea china and russia favorable currency effects primarily in australia and brazil added about 6 percent to the higher net sales while net selling prices were about even with last year 

  

   

in north america net sales rose more than 5 percent due to nearly 3 percent higher sales volumes and about 2 percent higher net selling prices sales volumes for bathroom tissue and paper towels increased 5 percent and 4 percent respectively on growth for scott bathroom tissue and viva paper towels reflecting product improvements for these brands net selling prices were impacted by promotional activity late in the year in support of product upgrades including the corporation’s improved cottonelle bathroom tissue as well as to support facial tissue in anticipation of a seasonal pickup in sales volumes that had not yet occurred because of a weaker cold and flu season in the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

in europe net sales increased approximately 9 percent principally due to favorable currency exchange rates improved product mix was negated by an overall sales volume decline of about 1 percent that resulted from the corporation’s 2006 decision to shed lowmargin business following the sale or closure of certain facilities in the region sales volume increases for andrex bathroom tissue and kleenex facial tissue were not sufficient to offset the withdrawal from the lowmargin business net selling prices remained about the same as in the prior year 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales increased more than 12 percent about half of the increase was due to favorable currency effects improved product mix of nearly 3 percent was tempered by lower sales volumes of slightly more than 1 percent net selling prices increased almost 5 percent as selling prices were raised during the year in most developing and emerging markets in response to higher raw material costs 

  

   

part ii 

continued 

 

  

   

   

2006 versus 2005 

  

   

consolidated net sales increased 53 percent from 2005 sales volumes rose more than 2 percent driven by growth in the personal care and health care segments net selling prices increased more than 1 percent as higher net selling prices for consumer tissue were partially offset by lower net selling prices for personal care favorable currency effects primarily in korea and brazil and improved product mix each added about 1 percent 

  

   

in north america net sales increased about 4 percent principally resulting from higher sales volumes for disposable diapers continued growth in child care products—goodnites youth pants and pullups training pants—huggies baby wipes and incontinence care products partially offset by continued lower feminine care sales volumes lower net selling prices of about 1 percent due to competitive pressures were partially offset by a favorable canadian dollar currency effect 

  

net sales in europe were even with the prior year as higher sales volumes were offset by lower net selling prices increased sales volumes primarily for disposable diapers were tempered by lower sales volumes for feminine care products 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales grew 14 percent with each of the regions contributing to the increase the overall increase was driven by more than 9 percent higher sales volumes reflecting doubledigit growth in latin america and the middle east africa and eastern europe favorable product mix led by results in korea and favorable currency effects primarily in korea and brazil each added about 2 percent to the net sales gain

in north america net sales were nearly 4 percent higher principally due to increased net selling prices as the benefit of improved product mix was partially offset by lower sales volumes the higher net selling prices resulted from price increases in february 2006 on bathroom tissue and towels and a price increase in april 2006 for facial tissue the price increases were tempered by higher promotional spending 

  

in europe net sales declined about 1 percent because higher net selling prices and favorable product mix did not offset lower sales volumes the lower sales volumes were due in part to the strategy of exiting low margin businesses 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales advanced about 9 percent sales volumes increased more than 1 percent net selling prices rose nearly 4 percent and favorable product mix and currency each added nearly 2 percent each of the regions contributed to the higher net selling prices and korea and brazil provided the most significant currency gains

commentary 

  

2007 versus 2006 

  

  

   

   

consolidated operating profit increased 5149 million or 245 percent lower charges for the strategic cost reduction plan the “plan” increased operating profit by 3772 million these charges as discussed later in this mda and in item 8 note 2 to the consolidated financial statements are not included in the business segments in addition cost savings generated by the plan totaled approximately 105 million during 2007 other factors affecting the comparison with 2006 were savings of nearly 160 million for the corporation’s focused on reducing costs everywhere program higher sales volumes and increased net selling prices partially offsetting these improvements were raw materials cost inflation of almost 350 million increased strategic marketing expenses of about 50 million and higher general and administrative expenses the increased general and administrative expenses were to a large extent in support of growth in the developing and emerging markets operating profit as a percent of net sales increased to 143 percent from 125 percent in 2006 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

   

operating profit in north america increased nearly 13 percent primarily on the strength of higher sales volumes cost savings and slightly higher net selling prices offset the effect of raw materials cost inflation increased operating profit in europe was driven by cost savings and higher sales volumes despite lower net selling prices operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased more than 25 percent on sales volume growth and cost savings that more than offset increased marketing and general and administrative expenses 

  

   

in north america operating profit declined more than 15 percent because higher net selling prices were more than offset by raw materials cost inflation primarily pulp costs the costs of product improvements and higher manufacturing costs operating profit in europe increased due to cost savings and favorable currency effects tempered by raw materials cost inflation and higher marketing and general and administrative expenses in the developing and emerging markets operating profit declined slightly as net selling price gains were more than offset by increased pulp costs higher manufacturing costs and increased general and administrative expenses 

  

   

   

strategic cost reduction plan 

  

during 2007 the corporation continued to make progress implementing the strategic cost reduction plan that supports the targeted growth initiatives announced in july 2005 as previously disclosed management expects this plan to reduce costs by streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations primarily in north america and europe creating a more competitive platform for growth and margin improvement 

  

pretax charges totaling 1072 million 4844 million and 2286 million for these cost reduction initiatives 614 million 3450 million and 1676 million after tax were recorded in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively see item 8 note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the detail of the costs recorded by year 

  

based on current estimates the strategic cost reductions are expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately 880 million to 910 million before tax 610—630 million after tax by the end of 2008 the change in estimate from the previous range of 950 million to 10 billion is primarily due to reduced severances because of higher attrition as well as higher than anticipated proceeds from asset sales the corporation expects the plan will yield anticipated annual pretax savings of at least 350 million by 2009 continuous productivity gains over the last several years along with investments in stateoftheart manufacturing capacity are enabling the corporation to consolidate production at fewer facilities cash costs related to the sale closure or streamlining of operations relocation of equipment severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 35 percent of the charges noncash charges consist primarily of incremental depreciation and amortization and asset impairments and writeoffs 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

by the end of 2008 management anticipates there will be a net workforce reduction of about 10 percent or approximately 6000 employees as of december 31 2007 a net workforce reduction of approximately 4700 had occurred approximately 24 manufacturing facilities or 17 percent of the corporation’s worldwide total are expected to be sold closed or streamlined there is a particular focus on europe aimed at improving business results in the region the corporation intends to continue to consolidate and streamline manufacturing facilities further improve operating efficiencies and reduce selling general and administrative expenses while reinvesting in key growth opportunities there as of december 31 2007 charges have been recorded related to the cost reduction initiatives for 23 facilities 

  

the strategic cost reductions are corporate decisions and are not included in the business segments’ operating profit performance see item 8 note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the 2007 2006 and 2005 costs of the strategic cost reductions by business segment and geographic area 

  

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net for 2007 includes a gain of 164 million for the settlement of litigation related to prior years’ operations in latin america currency transaction losses included in this line item were about 10 million lower in 2007 than in 2006 in addition gains on dispositions of facilities in 2007 as part of the strategic cost reduction plan were about 14 million compared with costs of 8 million in 2006 

  

commentary 

  

2006 versus 2005 

  

  

   

   

consolidated operating profit declined 90 percent or 2091 million primary factors that affected the comparison were approximately 256 million of higher charges in 2006 for the strategic cost reduction plan that are not included in the business segments as previously discussed in this mda and in item 8 note 2 to the consolidated financial statements cost inflation of about 385 million and higher marketing research and general expenses partially offsetting those factors were gross cost savings of about 265 million higher net selling prices and increased sales volumes as discussed in item 8 note 6 to the consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2006 the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” stock option expense under the provisions of sfas 123r reduced 2006 operating profit by about 35 million operating profit as a percent of net sales declined to 125 percent from 145 percent in 2005 

  

   

part ii 

continued 

 

  

operating profit in north america was even with 2005 as higher sales volumes and cost savings were offset by lower net selling prices materials cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs partly related to product improvements in europe operating results improved due to higher sales volumes cost savings and lower marketing research and general expenses operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased more than 10 percent primarily due to increased sales volumes and improved product mix tempered by increased marketing expenses 

  

   

in north america operating profit declined nearly 3 percent due to higher pulp energy distribution manufacturing and startup costs that more than offset higher net selling prices operating profit in europe decreased as higher pulp and energy costs and increased manufacturing expenses more than offset higher net selling prices and cost savings in the developing and emerging markets operating profit declined as higher pulp distribution and marketing research and general expenses more than offset the increased net selling prices 

  

   

   

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net increased by 51 million in 2006 while currency transaction losses were lower in 2006 than the prior year 2005 included income of approximately 22 million from an insurance claim for partial recovery of damages related to a fire in 2004 at a facility in europe also included in 2006 are the previously mentioned costs of 80 million for facilities disposed of as part of the strategic cost reduction plan 

  

additional income statement commentary 

  

synthetic fuel partnerships 

  

as described in item 8 note 14 to the consolidated financial statements the corporation owns minority interests in two synthetic fuel partnerships pretax losses from participation in these partnerships are reported as nonoperating expense in the consolidated income statement the lower level of losses in 2007 and 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the partnerships reducing operations in anticipation of the phaseout of related income tax credits as the price of crude oil increased during both 2007 and 2006 the corporation’s income tax provision was reduced by 805 million in 2007 compared with 860 million in 2006 resulting from the income tax credits and tax benefits of these investments the corporation’s income tax provision in 2006 was 1483 million higher as a result of decreased income tax credits and tax benefits compared with 2005 diluted earnings per share benefited by 03 in 2007 compared with 04 and 12 in 2006 and 2005 respectively from the synthetic fuel investments

cash flow commentary 

  

cash provided by operations decreased 1506 million in 2007 compared with 2006 included in 2006 was a special dividend of 123 million from kcm and the balance of the decrease was primarily due to a higher investment in working capital

the following table presents the corporation’s total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable 

  

   

obligations commentary 

  

   

   

   

the above table does not include future payments that the corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions including expected future service to project the future obligations based upon those projections the corporation anticipates making annual payments for these obligations within a range from more than 85 million in 2008 to more than 100 million by 2017 

  

as of december 31 2007 the corporation has accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions these liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 

  

deferred taxes minority owners’ interests and payments related to pension plans are also not included in the table 

  

a consolidated financing subsidiary has issued two classes of redeemable preferred securities the holder of the securities can elect to have the subsidiary redeem the first class in december 2011 and the second class in december 2014 and each 7year anniversary thereafter management currently anticipates that these securities

will not be redeemed at the next redemption dates and therefore they are not included in the above table in the event that the holder of the securities does elect to have its preferred securities redeemed at the next respective redemption date the corporation would be required to pay approximately 500 million in 2011 and approximately 500 million in 2014 see item 8 note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these securities

variable interest entities 

  

the corporation has interests in the following financing and real estate entities and synthetic fuel partnerships described in item 8 notes 10 11 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements all of which are subject to the requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities—an interpretation of arb 51 “fin 46r” 

  

financing entities 

  

the corporation holds a significant interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize longterm notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets to nonaffiliated buyers these transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in sfas no 66 accounting for sales of real estate  these sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of 617 million and a fair value of approximately 593 million at the date of sale the notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks which aggregated 617 million at december 31 2007 

  

because the corporation desired to monetize the 617 million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains it transferred the notes received from the sales to noncontrolled financing entities the corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities collectively the “financing entities” the transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the financing entities were made at fair value were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss in conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets the financing entities became obligated for 617 million in thirdparty debt financing a nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the financing entities has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the financing entities the corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating 662 million and intercompany preferred stock of 50 million to the financing entities which serve as secondary collateral for the thirdparty lending arrangements in the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit the corporation could experience a maximum loss of 617 million under these arrangements 

  

the corporation has not consolidated the financing entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity rather it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting the corporation retains equity interests in the financing entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes as a result the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the corporation’s equity interests in the financing entities for financial reporting purposes 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

see item 8 note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation’s luxembourgbased financing subsidiary which is consolidated because the corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity 

  

real estate entities 

  

the corporation participates in the us affordable housing and historic renovation real estate markets investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the us congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations accordingly these investments generate income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the corporation’s income tax liabilities the corporation invested in these markets through i partnership arrangements as a limited partner ii limited liability companies as a nonmanaging member and iii investments in various funds in which the corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors these entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects 

  

fin 46r requires the corporation to consolidate certain real estate entities because it is the primary beneficiary of them the corporation also consolidates certain other real estate entities pursuant to sfas no 94 consolidation of all majorityowned subsidiaries the assets of these entities classified principally as property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 have a carrying amount aggregating 1664 million that serves as collateral for 1176 million of obligations of these ventures neither the creditors nor the other beneficial interest holders of these consolidated ventures have recourse to the general credit of the corporation except for 222 million of permanent financing debt which is guaranteed by the corporation as of december 31 2007 the corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately 888 million on its consolidated real estate entities 

  

the corporation accounts for its interests in its nonconsolidated real estate entities by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method as appropriate and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in its income tax provision as of december 31 2007 the corporation had net equity of 143 million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities the corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately 875 million on these nonconsolidated real estate entities as of december 31 2007 total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was 2609 million a total of 217 million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the corporation and the remainder of this debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the corporation at december 31 2007 the corporation’s maximum loss exposure for its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be 535 million and is comprised of its net equity in these entities of 143 million its permanent financing guarantees of 217 million and the income tax credit recapture risk of 175 million 

  

if the corporation’s investments in all of its real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings as of december 31 2007 this recapture risk is estimated to be 418 million the corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need accordingly the recapture risk is considered to be remote 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

reporting period the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the corporation’s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals pension and other postretirement benefits retained insurable risks useful lives for depreciation and amortization future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments and loss contingencies the corporation’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

promotion and rebate accruals 

  

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the corporation’s products promotion accruals as of december 31 2007 and 2006 were 3477 million and 2968 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2007 and 2006 were 2527 million and 2145 million respectively 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

pension benefits 

  

the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets to the higher of the accumulated benefit obligation “abo” or regulatory minimum requirements subject to regulatory requirements and tax deductibility limits any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 

  

nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in such countries 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 1198 million in 2007 compared with 1669 million for 2006 pension expense included incremental costs of about 9 million and 11 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively for special pension benefits related to the strategic cost reductions pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

827 percent in 2007 compared with 828 percent in 2006 and will be 823 percent in 2008 the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on projected longterm returns of broad equity and bond indices the us plan’s historical 15year and 20year compounded annual returns of 101 percent and 103 percent respectively which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices were also considered on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the principal plans are anticipated to generate annual longterm rates of return of at least 84 percent the expected longterm rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers with expected longterm rates of return of approximately 10 percent and about 30 percent with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of about 6 percent actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate longterm rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary 

  

pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2007 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately 11 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns or ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” determined under sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions 

  

the discount or settlement rates used to determine the present values of the corporation’s future us and canadian pension obligations at december 31 2007 were based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years each year’s expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rates for the us and canadian pension obligations for the uk plans discount rates are established using a uk bond index comprised of high quality corporate debt securities with a duration approximately equal to the pension obligations the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans increased to 620 percent at december 31 2007 from 571 percent at december 31 2006 

  

consolidated pension expense is estimated to approximate 94 million in 2008 this estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 848 percent a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 620 percent and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2008 will depend on future investment performance the corporation’s contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

  

if the expected longterm rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 11 million if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 13 million and the december 31 2007 pension liability would increase by about 157 million 

  

the fair value of the assets in the corporation’s defined benefit plans was 47 billion and 46 billion at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately 8 billion and 11 billion at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively on a consolidated basis the corporation contributed about 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

98 million to pension trusts in 2007 compared with 132 million in 2006 in addition the corporation made direct benefit payments of 148 million in 2007 compared to 128 million in 2006 while the corporation is not required to make a contribution in 2008 to the us plan the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated the corporation currently anticipates contributing about 82 million to its pension plans outside the us in 2008 

  

the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is similar to the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation’s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

other postretirement benefits 

  

substantially all us retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans certain benefits are based on years of service andor age at retirement the plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 and contributory for most employees who retire after 1992 except that the corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003 

  

the corporation made benefit payments of 766 million in 2007 compared with 758 million in 2006 the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent 2008 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by approximately 1 million and the december 31 2007 benefit liability would increase by about 19 million 

  

the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including the corporation’s recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage health care cost trend rate is expected to be 844 percent in 2008 746 percent in 2009 and to gradually decline to 521 percent in 2020 and thereafter see item 8 note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate 

  

retained insurable risks 

  

selected insurable risks are retained primarily those related to property damage workers’ compensation and product automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events principally related to workers’ compensation and automobile liability are based upon undiscounted loss development factors 

  

property and depreciation 

  

estimating the useful lives of property plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment and actual lives may differ from these estimates changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate property plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such longlived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines future sales volumes growth rates for selling prices and costs alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets an asset impairment would be 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount the determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple probabilityweighted cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a riskfree rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

  

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans including the strategic cost reduction plan and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge actual outcomes may differ from the estimates for example if the corporation’s products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and additional impairment charges may be recognized 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of the corporation’s businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the corporation’s annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and it has been determined that its 29 billion of goodwill is not impaired 

  

the corporation has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2007 the corporation has other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately 308 million and a net carrying amount of about 132 million these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value based on discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

  

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities “vie” 

  

the determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities under fin 46r requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie using a computer simulation model and determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie requires the 

  

part ii 

continued

as of december 31 2007 the corporation had recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling 7180 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 3045 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 4135 million as of december 31 2006 the net deferred tax asset was 4091 million these carryforwards are primarily in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets the corporation considers many factors including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence the corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2007 in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 23 accounting for income taxes special areas us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 44 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate see item 8 note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of previously unremitted earnings that were repatriated in 2005 under the provisions of the american jobs creation act

loss contingencies 

  

the outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against the corporation is subject to uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies requires that an estimated loss contingency be accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain matters discussed in this form 10k or related documents a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference concerning among other things the business outlook including new product introductions cost savings anticipated costs and benefits related to the strategic cost reduction plan anticipated benefits from the asr program anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and anticipated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation’s results will be as estimated 

  

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices and availability of the corporation’s raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation’s products energy costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business could impact the realization of such estimates 

  

the factors described under item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k or in our other securities and exchange commission filings among others could cause the corporation’s future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

as a multinational enterprise the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions the corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 

  

presented below is a description of the corporation’s most significant risks foreign currency risk and interest rate risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect management’s view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period also included is a description of the corporation’s commodity price risk 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs 

  

as of december 31 2007 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 34 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2007 rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2007 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation’s foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced 

  

part ii 

continued 

 

  

stockholders’ equity by approximately 563 million these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2007 exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2007 the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 40 percent variablerate debt and 60 percent fixedrate debt the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and is designed to balance the corporation’s cost of financing with its interest rate risk 

  

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation’s financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2007 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 190 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation’s current level of variablerate debt with respect to commercial paper and other variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the corporation is subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

the corporation’s energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in its manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas risk in accordance with the corporation’s risk management policy 

  

management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation’s business or its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

kimberlyclark corporation 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of kimberlyclark corporation and subsidiaries the “corporation” as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control— integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10k or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission could adversely affect the corporations consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results 

  

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by such events as natural disasters power outages labor strikes and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper is used extensively in the corporation’s tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets recycled fiber accounts for approximately 29 percent of the corporation and its equity companies overall fiber requirements 

  

on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

a number of the corporation’s products such as diapers training and youth pants and incontinence care products contain certain materials which are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

the corporations manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels 

  

to ensure that it uses all forms of energy costeffectively the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites the corporation’s contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration the corporation’s energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully 

  

part i 

continued 

  

protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporations risk management policy 

  

increased pricing pressure and intense competition for sales of the corporation’s products could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

the corporation competes in intensely competitive markets against wellknown branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in the corporation’s competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels and competitive reaction some of the corporation’s major competitors have undergone consolidation which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry such consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results in addition the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies the introduction of a new consumer product whether improved or newly developed usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace if a product gains consumer acceptance it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position some of the corporation’s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the corporation these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the corporation can the corporation’s ability to develop new products is affected by whether it can develop and fund technological innovations receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising marketing and selling its products 

  

changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business 

  

the corporation’s products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the consolidation of retail trade especially in developed markets such as the us and europe the corporation is increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining power than does the corporation they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability the corporation may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products and other conditions if the corporation loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease the corporation’s business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation’s efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

  

the corporation began its competitive improvement initiatives in the third quarter of 2005 to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial

continued 

  

condition and results of operations” in addition the corporation anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments if the corporation cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions included in its competitive improvement initiatives or other cost savings plans the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these initiatives have on the corporation’s relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

the corporation’s sales may not occur as estimated 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences estimate sales of new products estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation’s products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses as a result the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales 

  

difficulties in expanding globally and in developing and emerging markets asia latin america the middle east eastern europe and africa may adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries the corporation’s results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries 

  

the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations including fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

in addition intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic political and competitive environments in latin america and developing countries in eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation’s sales growth and earnings potential the corporation’s success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form such alliances in addition there can be no assurance that the corporation’s products will be accepted in any particular market the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies are systematically hedged through foreign currency forward option and swap contracts translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

pending litigation and administrative actions could have an adverse effect on the corporation 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws including intellectual property laws in addition the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in such actions the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with certainty although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

part i 

continued 

  

beginning in 2007 t he corporation will obtain certain administrative services from third part ies which have previously been provided by employees of the corporation if the thirdparty service providers fail to satisfactorily perform these administrative services our operations could be adversely impact ed  

  

as part of the corporation’s global business plan a number of administrative functions are being transferred to thirdparty service providers beginning in 2007 those functions include certain information technology finance and accounting sourcing and supply management and human resources services although moving these administrative functions to thirdparty service providers is expected to lower the corporation’s cost of operations the corporation could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services disruptions or delays at the thirdparty service providers due to regional economic business environmental or political events or information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact the corporation’s operations payments to the corporation’s vendors employees and others and the corporation’s ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis

overview of 2006 results 

  

competitive pressures continued during 2006 in most of the corporation’s businesses in addition the corporation continued to be adversely affected by raw material cost inflation and higher energy and related costs 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

results of operations and related information 

  

this section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2006 results of operations this discussion and analysis compares 2006 results to 2005 and 2005 results to 2004 each discussion focuses first on consolidated results and then the results of each reportable business segment

by geographic area 

  

    

commentary 

  

2006 versus 2005 

  

   

consolidated net sales increased 53 percent from 2005 sales volumes rose more than 2 percent driven by growth in the personal care and health care segments net selling prices increased more than 1 percent as higher 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

net selling prices for consumer tissue were partially offset by lower net selling prices for personal care favorable currency effects primarily in korea and brazil and improved product mix each added about 1 percent 

  

   

in north america net sales increased about 4 percent principally resulting from higher sales volumes for disposable diapers continued growth in child care products—goodnites youth pants and pullups training pants—huggies baby wipes and incontinence care products partially offset by continued lower feminine care sales volumes lower net selling prices of about 1 percent due to competitive pressures were partially offset by a favorable canadian dollar currency effect 

  

net sales in europe were even with the prior year as higher sales volumes were offset by lower net selling prices increased sales volumes primarily for disposable diapers were tempered by lower sales volumes for feminine care products 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales grew 14 percent with each of the regions contributing to the increase the overall increase was driven by more than 9 percent higher sales volumes reflecting doubledigit growth in latin america and the middle east africa and eastern europe favorable product mix led by results in korea and favorable currency effects primarily in korea and brazil each added about 2 percent to the net sales gain 

  

   

in north america net sales were nearly 4 percent higher principally due to increased net selling prices as the benefit of improved product mix was partially offset by lower sales volumes the higher net selling prices resulted from price increases in february 2006 on bathroom tissue and towels and a price increase in april 2006 for facial tissue the price increases were tempered by higher promotional spending 

  

in europe net sales declined about 1 percent because higher net selling prices and favorable product mix did not offset lower sales volumes the lower sales volumes were due in part to the strategy of exiting low margin businesses 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales advanced about 9 percent sales volumes increased more than 1 percent net selling prices rose nearly 4 percent and favorable product mix and currency each added nearly 2 percent each of the regions contributed to the higher net selling prices and korea and brazil provided the most significant currency gains 

  

   

   

part ii 

continued 

  

2005 versus 2004 

  

   

consolidated net sales increased 54 percent from 2004 sales volumes rose more than 3 percent with each of the business segments contributing to the increase currency effects added nearly 2 percent to the increase primarily due to strengthening of the south korean won the brazilian real the canadian dollar and the australian dollar net selling prices increased 1 percent offset by a reduction in net sales due to the divestiture of the pulp operations as part of the spinoff of neenah paper on november 30 2004 

  

   

in north america net sales increased more than 1 percent resulting from 3 percent higher sales volumes reflecting higher sales of huggies diapers growth in child care products—goodnites youth underpants pullups training pants and little swimmers swimpants—and incontinence brands poise and depend partially offset by lower feminine care sales volumes lower net selling prices of about 1 percent and an unfavorable product mix tempered the effect of the overall higher sales volumes 

  

net sales in europe declined nearly 5 percent higher sales volumes for diapers were more than offset by reduced sales volumes for feminine care products overall net selling prices decreased about 7 percent due to continued competitive pressure currency effects provided a more than 1 percent favorable impact on the comparison 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales grew nearly 16 percent driven by about 6 percent higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects of the same magnitude the advance in sales volume was led by doubledigit growth in latin america with increases across the region asia also contributed to the sales volume increase the favorable currency effects occurred primarily in korea brazil and australia net selling prices increased about 3 percent with gains in each of the geographic regions 

  

   

in north america net sales advanced nearly 11 percent as higher sales volumes and higher net selling prices each contributed about 5 percent to the improvement a more favorable product sales mix also added about 1 percent the higher sales volumes were driven by the introduction of scott extra soft bathroom tissue in february 2005 list price increases on bathroom and facial tissue and on towels that occurred in august 2004 resulted in the higher net selling prices kleenex antiviral facial tissue introduced in september 2004 was the primary leader in the improved product mix 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

in europe net sales decreased nearly 2 percent principally due to over 3 percent lower net selling prices reflecting continuing competitive pressures sales volumes were even with the prior year and currency provided about a 1 percent favorable effect 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales increased approximately 16 percent primarily due to about 8 percent higher sales volumes and approximately 6 percent favorable currency effects korea australia and brazil were the most significant contributors to both sales volume and currency gains

by geographic area 

  

   

   

   

part ii 

continued 

  

commentary 

  

2006 versus 2005 

  

    

   

consolidated operating profit declined 90 percent or 2091 million primary factors that affected the comparison were approximately 256 million of higher charges in 2006 for the strategic cost reduction plan that are not included in the business segments as discussed later in this mda and in item 8 note 2 to the consolidated financial statements cost inflation of about 385 million and higher marketing research and general expenses partially offsetting those factors were gross cost savings of about 265 million higher net selling prices and increased sales volumes as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2006 the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” stock option expense under the provisions of sfas 123r reduced 2006 operating profit by about 35 million operating profit as a percent of net sales declined to 125 percent from 145 percent in 2005 

  

   

operating profit in north america was even with last year as higher sales volumes and cost savings were offset by lower net selling prices materials cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs partly related to product improvements in europe operating results improved due to higher sales volumes cost savings and lower marketing research and general expenses operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased more than 10 percent primarily due to increased sales volumes and improved product mix tempered by increased marketing expenses 

  

   

in north america operating profit declined nearly 3 percent due to higher pulp energy distribution manufacturing and startup costs that more than offset higher net selling prices operating profit in europe decreased as higher pulp and energy costs and increased manufacturing expenses more than offset higher net selling prices and cost savings in the developing and emerging markets operating profit declined as higher pulp distribution and marketing research and general expenses more than offset the increased net selling prices

strategic cost reduction plan 

  

during 2006 the corporation made progress implementing the strategic cost reduction plan that will support the targeted growth investments announced in july 2005 as previously disclosed management expects this plan to reduce costs by streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations primarily in north america and europe creating a more competitive platform for growth and margin improvement 

  

pretax charges totaling 4844 million and 2286 million for these cost reduction initiatives 3450 million and 1676 million after tax were recorded in 2006 and 2005 respectively see item 8 note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the detail of the costs recorded in 2006 and 2005 

  

based on current estimates the strategic cost reductions are expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately 950 million to 10 billion before tax 665—700 million after tax by the end of 2008 the change in estimate from the previous range of 10 billion to 11 billion was primarily due to reduced severances because of higher attrition and higher than anticipated proceeds from asset sales the corporation expects these actions will yield anticipated annual pretax savings of at least 350 million by 2009 continuous productivity gains over the last several years along with investments in stateoftheart manufacturing capacity are enabling the corporation to consolidate production at fewer facilities cash costs related to the sale closure or streamlining of operations relocation of equipment severance and other expenses are expected to account for less than 40 percent of the charges noncash charges consist primarily of incremental depreciation and amortization and asset write downs 

  

by the end of 2008 management anticipates there will be a net workforce reduction of about 10 percent or approximately 6000 employees as of december 31 2006 a net workforce reduction of more than 3000 had occurred approximately 20 manufacturing facilities or 17 percent of the corporation’s worldwide total are expected to be sold or closed and an additional 4 facilities are expected to be streamlined there is a particular focus on europe aimed at improving business results in the region the corporation intends to consolidate and streamline manufacturing facilities further improve operating efficiencies and reduce selling general and administrative expenses while reinvesting in key growth opportunities there as of december 31 2006 charges have been recorded related to the cost reduction initiatives for 23 facilities 

  

the strategic cost reductions are corporate decisions and are not included in the business segments’ operating profit performance see item 8 note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the 2006 and 2005 costs of the strategic cost reductions by business segment and geographic area 

  

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net increased by 51 million in 2006 while currency transaction losses were lower in 2006 than the prior year 2005 included income of approximately 22 million from an insurance claim for partial recovery of damages related to a fire in 2004 at a facility in europe also included in 2006 are costs of 80 million for facilities disposed of as part of the strategic cost reduction plan

2005 versus 2004 

  

    

   

   

consolidated operating profit decreased 78 percent significant items that negatively affected operating profit were approximately 229 million of charges related to the previously discussed strategic cost reduction plan cost inflation of about 400 million and higher marketing research and general expenses those items were partially offset by gross cost savings of nearly 210 million increased sales volumes and higher net selling prices operating profit as a percent of net sales declined to 145 percent from 166 percent for 2004 

  

   

operating profit in north america declined about 3 percent as materials cost inflation lower net selling prices and higher distribution costs more than offset cost savings and the higher sales volumes in europe operating profit decreased primarily due to the lower net selling prices operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased nearly 16 percent due to the higher sales volumes higher net selling prices and favorable currency effects tempered by higher marketing and administrative costs 

  

   

in north america operating profit grew almost 8 percent because the higher net selling prices and increased sales volumes more than offset the cost inflation operating profit in europe decreased principally due to the effects of the competitive lower net selling prices in the developing and emerging markets operating profit advanced approximately 19 percent on the strength of the higher sales volumes and a favorable product mix

other income and expense net 

  

other income and expense net decreased compared with 2004 primarily due to the previously described income in 2005 of approximately 22 million from an insurance claim increased currency transaction losses in 2005 were mitigated by lower writeoffs related to the corporation’s investments in historic real estate restoration projects 

  

additional income statement commentary 

  

synthetic fuel partnerships 

  

as described in item 8 note 14 to the consolidated financial statements the corporation owns minority interests in two synthetic fuel partnerships pretax losses from participation in these partnerships are reported as nonoperating expense in the consolidated income statement the 1135 million decrease in these losses in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the partnerships reducing operations in anticipation of the phaseout of related tax credits as the price of crude oil increased during 2006 the corporation’s income tax provision in 2006 was 1483 million higher as a result of decreased income tax credits and tax benefits compared with 2005 for 2005 the 206 million increase in these losses compared with 2004 was primarily due to the corporation’s fullyear participation in one of the partnerships versus a partial year in 2004 the corporation’s income tax provision was lowered by 345 million in 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of increased income tax credits and tax benefits of the higher nonoperating expenses diluted earnings per share benefited by 04 in 2006 compared with 12 and 08 in 2005 and 2004 respectively from the synthetic fuel investments

variable interest entities 

  

the corporation has interests in the following financing and real estate entities and synthetic fuel partnerships described in item 8 note 14 to the consolidated financial statements all of which are subject to the requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities—an interpretation of arb 51 “fin 46r” 

  

financing entities 

  

the corporation holds a significant interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize longterm notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets to nonaffiliated buyers these transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in sfas no 66 accounting for sales of real estate  these sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of 617 million and a fair value of approximately 593 million at the date of sale the notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks which aggregated 617 million at december 31 2006 

  

because the corporation desired to monetize the 617 million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains the corporation transferred the notes received from the sales to noncontrolled financing entities the corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities collectively the “financing entities” the transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the financing entities were made at fair value were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss in conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets the financing entities became obligated for 617 million in thirdparty debt financing a nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the financing entities has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the financing entities the corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating 662 million and intercompany preferred stock of 50 million to the financing entities which serve as secondary collateral for the thirdparty lending arrangements in the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit the corporation could experience a maximum loss of 617 million under these arrangements 

  

the corporation has not consolidated the financing entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity rather it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting the corporation retains equity interests in the financing entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes as a result the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the corporation’s equity interests in the financing entities for financial reporting purposes 

  

see item 8 note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation’s luxembourgbased financing subsidiary which is consolidated because the corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity

real estate entities 

  

the corporation participates in the us affordable housing and historic renovation real estate markets investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the united states congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations accordingly these investments generate income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the corporation’s income tax liabilities the corporation invested in these markets through i partnership arrangements as a limited partner ii limited liability companies as a nonmanaging member and iii investments in various funds in which the corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors these entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects 

  

financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities—an interpretation of arb 51  requires the corporation to consolidate certain real estate entities because it is the primary beneficiary of them at december 31 2006 the carrying amount of assets of these entities aggregating 49 million serves as collateral for 37 million of obligations of these ventures the assets are classified as property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet neither the creditors nor the other beneficial interest holders of these consolidated ventures have recourse to the general credit of the corporation 

  

the corporation accounts for its interests in its nonconsolidated real estate entities by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method as appropriate and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in its income tax provision as of december 31 2006 the corporation had net equity of 196 million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities the corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately 977 million 841 million and 718 million through 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively as of december 31 2006 total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was 2835 million a total of 350 million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the corporation and the remainder of this debt is not supported or guaranteed by the corporation except for the guaranteed portion permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the corporation from time to time temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the corporation in general the corporation’s interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained at december 31 2006 493 million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the corporation 

  

if the corporation’s investments in its nonconsolidated real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings as of december 31 2006 this recapture risk is estimated to be 366 million the corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need accordingly the recapture risk is considered to be remote 

  

at december 31 2006 the corporation’s maximum loss exposure for its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be 1405 million and was comprised of its net equity in these entities of 196 million its permanent financing guarantees of 350 million its interim financing guarantees of 493 million and the income tax credit recapture risk of 366 million 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the corporation’s 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals pension benefits and other postretirement benefits retained insurable risks useful lives for depreciation and amortization future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments and loss contingencies the corporation’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

promotion and rebate accruals 

  

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable endofaisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the corporation’s products promotion accruals as of december 31 2006 and 2005 were 2968 million and 2353 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2006 and 2005 were 2145 million and 1602 million respectively 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

pension benefits 

  

the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets to the higher of the accumulated benefit obligation “abo” or regulatory minimum requirements subject to regulatory requirements and tax deductibility limits any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 

  

nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in such countries 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 1669 million in 2006 compared with 1568 million for 2005 pension expense included incremental costs of about 11 million and 2 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively for special pension benefits related to the strategic cost reductions pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 828 percent in 2006 compared with 829 percent in 2005 and will be 827 percent in 2007 the expected 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

longterm rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors including input from the corporation’s pension investment consultants and projected longterm returns of broad equity and bond indices the us plan’s historical 15year and 20year compounded annual returns of 99 percent and 109 percent respectively which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices were also considered on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the principal plans are anticipated to generate annual longterm rates of return of at least 85 percent the expected longterm rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers with expected longterm rates of return of approximately 10 percent and about 30 percent with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of about 6 percent actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate also when deemed appropriate hedging strategies are executed using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level this hedging strategy was last executed for 2003 no hedging instruments are currently in place longterm rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary 

  

pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets are recognized in pension expense more rapidly than they would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2006 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately 14 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns or ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” determined under sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions 

  

the discount or settlement rate used to determine the present value of the corporation’s future us pension obligations at december 31 2006 was based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years each year’s expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rate for us pension obligations for the nonus principal plans discount rates are established using the longterm local government bond rates increased by the interest rate spread between the us discount rate and longterm us government bond rates subject to consistency with the prevailing range of discount rates used by other companies in those jurisdictions the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans increased to 571 percent at december 31 2006 from 554 percent at december 31 2005 

  

consolidated pension expense is estimated to approximate 116 million in 2007 this estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 85 percent a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 571 percent and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2007 will depend on future investment performance the corporation’s contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

  

if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for the principal plans was lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 10 million if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 16 million and the december 31 2006 pension liability would increase by about 193 million 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

the fair value of the assets in the corporation’s defined benefit plans was 46 billion and 41 billion at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately 11 billion and 14 billion at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively on a consolidated basis the corporation contributed about 132 million to pension trusts in 2006 compared with 117 million in 2005 in addition the corporation made direct benefit payments of 128 million in 2006 compared to 119 million in 2005 while the corporation is not required to make a contribution in 2007 to the us plan the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated the corporation currently anticipates contributing about 94 million to its pension plans outside the us in 2007 

  

the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is similar to the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation’s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

other postretirement benefits 

  

substantially all north american retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans certain benefits are based on years of service andor age at retirement the plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 and contributory for most employees who retire after 1992 except that the corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003 these plans are not funded until the year in which payments are made for benefit claims 

  

the corporation’s contributions to the plans and direct benefit payments were 692 million in 2006 compared with 665 million in 2005 the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans are discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent our annual other postretirement benefit expense would increase by approximately 1 million and the december 31 2006 benefit liability would increase by about 19 million 

  

prior to 2004 certain us plans limited the corporation’s cost of future annual per capita retiree medical benefits to no more than 200 percent of the 1992 annual per capita cost these plans reached this limitation the “cap” and were amended during 2003 among other things the amendments index the cap by 3 percent annually beginning in 2005 for certain employees retiring on or before april 1 2004 and limit the corporation’s future cost for retiree health care benefits to a defined fixed per capita cost for certain employees retiring after april 1 2004 

  

the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including the corporation’s recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage health care cost trend rate is expected to be 934 percent in 2007 836 percent in 2008 and to gradually decline to 517 percent in 2019 and thereafter see item 8 note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate 

  

retained insurable risks 

  

selected insurable risks are retained primarily those related to property damage workers’ compensation and product automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events principally related to workers’ compensation and automobile liability are based upon loss development factors provided to the corporation by external insurance brokers and are not discounted

property and depreciation 

  

estimating the useful lives of property plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment and actual lives may differ from these estimates changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate property plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such longlived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines future sales volumes growth rates for selling prices and costs alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount the determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

  

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans including the strategic cost reduction plan and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge actual outcomes may differ from the estimates for example if the corporation’s products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and additional impairment charges may be recognized 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of the corporation’s businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the corporation’s annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and it has been determined that its 29 billion of goodwill is not impaired 

  

the corporation has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2006 the corporation has other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately 289 million and a net carrying amount of about 133 million these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

  

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities “vie” 

  

the determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities under fin 46r requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie using a computer simulation model and determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie requires the exercise of significant management judgment the resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each vie in accordance with their beneficial interests the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie under fin 46r 

  

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

  

as of december 31 2006 the corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling 7421 million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 3330 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 4091 million as of december 31 2005 the net deferred tax asset was 3154 million income tax loss and capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the us foreign tax credits earned in the us in current and prior years which cannot be used currently also give rise to net deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets the corporation considers many factors including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence the corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2006 united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 44 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 23 accounting for income taxes special areas these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate see item 8 note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of previously unremitted earnings that were repatriated in 2005 under the provisions of the american jobs creation act 

  

the corporation accrues liabilities for current income taxes for potential assessments which at december 31 2006 and 2005 aggregated to 2372 million and 2688 million respectively the accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations the corporation’s us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2003 irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 1998 refund actions are pending with the irs examination division or appeals office for the years 1993 through 1998 management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

loss contingencies 

  

the outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against the corporation is subject to uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies requires that an estimated loss contingency be accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies 

  

legal matters 

  

environmental matters 

  

the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of which individually or in the aggregate in managements opinion is likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

business outlook 

  

the corporation has continued to execute its global business plan to sustain performance and drive shareholder value over the long term the corporation expects to continue to execute the plan in 2007 with emphasis on its targeted growth initiatives the corporation also expects to continue to reinvest cost savings to support innovation improve brand equity and advance its capabilities particularly in the areas of customer development and strategic marketing finally the corporation intends to remain focused on improving return on invested capital increasing cash flow and deploying its cash in shareholderfriendly ways 

  

forwardlooking statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

as a multinational enterprise the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions the corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 

  

presented below is a description of the corporation’s most significant risks foreign currency risk interest rate risk and commodity price risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect management’s view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward option and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs 

  

as of december 31 2006 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 30 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2006 rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

  

as of december 31 2006 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporations foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders’ equity by approximately 541 million these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2006 exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variableand fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2006 the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 43 percent variablerate debt and 57 percent fixedrate debt the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and is designed to balance the corporation’s cost of financing with its interest rate risk 

  

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporations financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2006 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 84 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporations current level of variablerate debt with respect to commercial paper and other variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the corporation is subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

the corporations energy manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources in addition the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in its manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas risk in accordance with the corporations risk management policy 

  

management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation’s business or its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

kimberlyclark corporation 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that kimberlyclark corporation and subsidiaries the “corporation” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

the corporation competes for customers in intensely competitive markets against wellknown branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally inherent risks in the corporation’s competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of recent consolidations of retailers and distribution channels and competitive reaction some of the corporation’s major competitors have undergone consolidation which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry such consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions each of which could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results in addition the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising marketing and selling its products 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation’s efforts to reduce costs will be successful 

  

the corporation began its competitive improvement initiatives in the third quarter of 2005 to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in addition the corporation anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments if the corporation cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions included in its competitive improvement initiatives or other cost savings plans the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits any negative impact these initiatives have on the corporation’s relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

significant increases in prices for raw materials energy transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials including pulp and petroleumbased materials the cost of energy transportation and other necessary services supplier constraints an inability to maintain favorable 

  

part i 

continued 

  

supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by such events as natural disasters power outages labor strikes and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered pulp is used extensively in the corporation’s tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the pulp markets recycled fiber accounts for approximately 25 percent of the corporation’s overall fiber requirements 

  

on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

a number of the corporation’s products such as diapers training and youth pants and incontinence care products contain certain materials which are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

the corporation’s manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure that it uses all forms of energy cost effectively the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites the corporation’s contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration the corporation’s energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation’s risk management policy 

  

the corporation’s sales may not occur as estimated 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences estimate sales of new products estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation’s products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses as a result the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales 

  

difficulties in expanding globally and in developing and emerging markets asia latin america the middle east eastern europe and africa may adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries the corporation’s results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries 

  

the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations including fluctuations in currency rates adverse political and economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints tariffs and other trade barriers 

  

part i 

continued 

  

difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation’s financial results 

  

in addition intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic political and competitive environments in argentina brazil colombia mexico venezuela and elsewhere in latin america and developing countries in eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation’s sales growth and earnings potential the corporation’s success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form such alliances in addition there can be no assurance that the corporation’s products will be accepted in any particular market the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies are systematically hedged through foreign currency forward option and swap contracts translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

pending litigation and administrative actions could have an adverse effect on the corporation 

  

there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws including intellectual property laws in addition the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in such actions the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with certainty although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

changes in laws regulations and accounting standards could have an adverse effect on the corporation’s financial results 

  

the corporation is subject to federal state local and foreign governmental regulation including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and numerous related regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the public company accounting oversight board and the financial accounting standards board the corporation has incurred substantial costs in complying with sox and other regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure although the corporation is in compliance with the laws and regulations regarding recording and reporting of financial results there can be no assurance that future regulations or interpretations of such regulations will not have an adverse impact on the corporation’s financial results as compared with prior reporting periods

part ii 

continued 

  

   

aggressive competitive actions in 2004 and 2005 have required increased promotional spending to support new product introductions and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the corporation’s products in the market we expect competition to continue to be intense in 2006 

  

   

   

   

overview of 2005 results 

  

during 2005 the corporation continued to face intense competition in most of its markets in particular the diaper and pants categories in north america and europe continued to be affected by the competitive pricing pressures that began in late 2002 the businesses were also adversely affected by higher materials input costs and higher energy and related costs 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

results of operations and related information 

  

this section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2005 results of operations this discussion and analysis compares 2005 results to 2004 and 2004 results to 2003 each of those discussions focuses first on consolidated results and then the results of each reportable business segment

commentary 

  

2005 versus 2004 

  

   

consolidated net sales increased 54 percent from 2004 sales volumes rose more than 3 percent with each of the business segments contributing to the increase currency effects added nearly 2 percent to the increase primarily due to strengthening of the south korean won the brazilian real the canadian dollar and the australian dollar net selling prices increased 1 percent offset by a reduction in net sales due to the divestiture of the pulp operations as part of the spinoff of neenah paper on november 30 2004 

  

   

part ii 

continued 

  

   

in north america net sales increased more than 1 percent resulting from 3 percent higher sales volumes reflecting higher sales of huggies diapers growth in child care products—goodnites youth underpants pullups training pants and little swimmers swimpants—and incontinence brands poise and depend partially offset by lower feminine care sales volumes lower net selling prices of about 1 percent and an unfavorable product mix tempered the effect of the overall higher sales volumes 

  

net sales in europe declined nearly 5 percent higher sales volumes for diapers were more than offset by reduced sales volumes for feminine care products overall net selling prices decreased about 7 percent due to continued competitive pressure currency effects provided a more than 1 percent favorable impact on the comparison 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales grew nearly 16 percent driven by about 6 percent higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects of the same magnitude the advance in sales volume was led by doubledigit growth in latin america with increases across the region asia also contributed to the sales volume increase the favorable currency effects occurred primarily in korea brazil and australia net selling prices increased about 3 percent with gains in each of the geographic regions 

  

   

in north america net sales advanced nearly 11 percent as higher sales volumes and higher net selling prices each contributed about 5 percent to the improvement a more favorable product sales mix also added about 1 percent the higher sales volumes were driven by the introduction of scott extra soft bathroom tissue in february 2005 list price increases on bathroom and facial tissue and on towels that occurred in august 2004 resulted in the higher net selling prices kleenex antiviral facial tissue introduced in september 2004 was the primary leader in the improved product mix 

  

in europe net sales decreased nearly 2 percent principally due to over 3 percent lower net selling prices reflecting continuing competitive pressures sales volumes were even with the prior year and currency provided about a 1 percent favorable effect 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales increased approximately 16 percent primarily due to about 8 percent higher sales volumes and approximately 6 percent favorable currency effects korea australia and brazil were the most significant contributors to both sales volume and currency gains 

  

   

part ii 

continued 

  

2004 versus 2003 

  

   

consolidated net sales increased 75 percent from 2003 sales volumes advanced approximately 5 percent with contributions from each of the business segments about 1 percentage point of the increase in sales volumes was due to the consolidation in august 2003 of klabin kimberly sa “klabin” a former equity affiliate and brazil’s largest tissue manufacturer currency effects added more than 3 percent to the increase primarily due to strengthening of the euro british pound and australian and canadian dollars slightly lower net selling prices were offset by a more favorable product mix 

  

   

in north america net sales increased nearly 5 percent driven by a more than 6 percent sales volume increase reflecting higher sales of huggies diapers and doubledigit growth for child care products—goodnites youth underpants pullups training pants little swimmers swimpants—and incontinence brands poise and depend net selling prices declined about 2 percent primarily in response to competitive activity favorable canadian dollar exchange rate effects also contributed to the increase in net sales the increased child care volumes are due to strong category growth through increased consumer usage market share for feminine care products declined as a result of significant competitive activity 

  

net sales in europe were even with last year as 10 percent favorable currency effects were offset by almost 7 percent lower sales volumes and a 3 percent reduction in net selling prices lower sales volumes for diapers and feminine care products were a result of aggressive competitive price reductions and promotion spending this more than offset higher sales volumes for child and adult care products except for child care which benefited from a prior year price increase net selling prices declined due to competitive activity 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales increased about 10 percent with higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects each contributing about 5 percent while improved product mix essentially offset lower net selling prices advances in sales volumes and favorable currency were realized in both korea and australia latin america and israel also recorded higher sales volumes 

  

   

in north america net sales increased almost 4 percent with higher sales volumes and net selling prices each contributing about 2 percent the higher sales volumes were led by increased sales for scott bathroom tissue and private label partially offset by lower sales volumes for kleenex facial tissue in the third quarter of 2004 the corporation implemented list price increases on its bathroom and facial tissue products and on paper towels these price increases along with a reduction in trade promotion 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

spending in the fourth quarter contributed to the higher net selling prices in facial tissue products the corporation’s main competitor did not match the corporation’s price increases in some product codes which is reflected in the corporation’s lower market share for the category the third quarter 2004 introduction of kleenex antiviral facial tissue contributed to a slight increase in net sales due to product mix 

  

in europe net sales increased nearly 9 percent because of an almost 11 percent favorable effect from currency tempered by lower net selling prices that reflect the continuing competitive marketplace sales volumes were nearly 1 percent higher primarily due to increased sales of andrex products in the united kingdom 

  

in the developing and emerging markets net sales advanced approximately 20 percent on a sales volume increase of more than 11 percent of which about 7 percentage points was attributable to the consolidation of klabin favorable currency effects of almost 5 percent primarily in australia and a favorable product mix 

  

   

professional products achieved more than 5 percent higher sales volumes and higher sales of nonwoven products provided additional benefit the favorable currency effects were principally due to europe despite price increases in the fourth quarter for professional products in north america net selling prices for the year declined due to price erosion in contract business across the segment

part ii 

continued 

  

commentary 

  

2005 versus 2004 

  

    

   

   

consolidated operating profit decreased 78 percent significant factors that negatively affected operating profit were approximately 229 million of charges related to the competitive improvement initiatives that are not included in the business segments as discussed later in this mda and in item 8 note 3 to the consolidated financial statements cost inflation of about 400 million and higher marketing research and general expenses those factors were partially offset by gross cost savings of nearly 210 million increased sales volumes and higher net selling prices operating profit as a percent of net sales declined to 145 percent from 166 percent for 2004 

  

   

operating profit in north america declined about 3 percent as materials cost inflation lower net selling prices and higher distribution costs more than offset cost savings and the higher sales volumes in europe operating profit decreased primarily due to the lower net selling prices operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased nearly 16 percent due to the higher sales volumes higher net selling prices and favorable currency effects tempered by higher marketing and administrative costs 

  

   

in north america operating profit grew almost 8 percent because the higher net selling prices and increased sales volumes more than offset the cost inflation operating profit in europe decreased principally due to the effects of the competitive lower net selling prices in the developing and emerging markets operating profit advanced approximately 19 percent on the strength of the higher sales volumes and a favorable product mix 

  

   

part ii

competitive improvement initiatives 

  

in july 2005 the corporation authorized the initial phase of a multiyear program to further improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and strategic cost reductions aimed at streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations primarily in north america and europe the “competitive improvement initiatives” 

  

the competitive improvement initiatives commenced in the third quarter of 2005 and are expected to be substantially completed by december 31 2008 based on current estimates the strategic cost reductions are expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately 900 million to 11 billion before tax 625775 million after tax over that three and onehalf year period these reductions are expected to yield annual pretax savings that increase to 300350 million by 2009 continuous productivity gains over the last several years along with investments in stateoftheart manufacturing capacity are enabling the corporation to consolidate production at fewer facilities cash costs related to the sale closure or streamlining of operations relocation of equipment severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 45 percent of the charges noncash charges will consist primarily of incremental depreciation and amortization and asset write downs 

  

by the end of 2008 it is anticipated there will be a net workforce reduction of about 10 percent or approximately 6000 employees as of december 31 2005 a net workforce reduction of more than 400 had occurred approximately 20 manufacturing facilities or 17 percent of the corporation’s worldwide total are expected to be sold or closed and an additional 4 facilities are expected to be streamlined there is a particular focus on europe aimed at improving business results in the region the corporation intends to consolidate and streamline manufacturing facilities further improve operating efficiencies and reduce selling general and administrative expenses while reinvesting in key growth opportunities there as of december 31 2005 charges have been recorded related to the initiatives for 14 facilities 

  

the initial phase of the competitive improvement initiatives will occur between 2005 and mid2007 and will include the sale closure or streamlining of 15 of the facilities and the expansion of 3 others aftertax charges in connection with these projects are expected to total approximately 355390 million the corporation anticipates that the pretax charges for the initial phase of the strategic cost reductions will be incurred for the following categories at the indicated estimated amounts workforce reduction costs approximately 150 million incremental depreciation and amortization approximately 225 million asset impairments approximately 100 million and other associated costs approximately 55 million during 2005 the corporation incurred charges totaling 2286 million in connection with the initiatives 1676 million after tax 

  

the strategic cost reductions included in the competitive improvement initiatives are corporate decisions and are not included in the business segments’ operating profit performance see item 8 note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the 2005 costs of the strategic cost reductions by business segment and geographic area certain actions yet to be announced for the strategic cost reductions are still being evaluated accordingly it is difficult at this time to estimate the total costs to be incurred by business segment over the life of the initiatives the 2005 charges have been recorded in cost of products sold 2016 million and marketing research and general expenses 270 million 

  

other income expense net 

  

other income expense net decreased compared with 2004 primarily due to income in 2005 of approximately 22 million from an insurance claim for partial recovery of damages related to a fire in 2004 at a facility in europe increased currency transaction losses in 2005 were mitigated by lower writeoffs related to the corporation’s investments in historic real estate restoration projects 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

2004 versus 2003 

  

    

consolidated operating profit increased 75 percent as the higher sales volumes about 160 million of benefit from cost savings programs and total favorable currency effects of over 70 million more than offset the lower net selling prices higher fiber costs and increased energy and distribution expenses operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 166 percent the same as 2003 

  

   

costs to implement the infant care plan described above total approximately 40 million before tax including about 37 million recorded in 2004 the balance of the plan costs were recorded in 2005 as they were incurred of the total 2004 cost approximately 10 million was for employee severance recorded at the time employees were notified of their termination benefits about 3 million for other cash costs principally for equipment removal and 24 million for asset writeoffs primarily related to the original equipment installation costs these costs were recorded in cost of products sold 

  

operating profit in north america increased about 1 percent as the benefits of the higher sales volumes and cost savings programs were partially offset by the lower selling prices costs of the infant care plan and higher advertising and distribution costs in europe operating profit declined because of the negative impacts of the competitive environment on selling prices and sales volumes operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased over 7 percent principally due to higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects partially offset by higher marketing expenses

as described in item 8 note 14 to the consolidated financial statements the corporation owns minority interests in two synthetic fuel partnerships pretax losses from participation in these partnerships are recorded as nonoperating expenses in the consolidated income statement the 206 million increase in these losses in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the corporation’s fullyear participation in one of the partnerships versus a partial year in 2004 the corporation’s income tax provision was lowered by 345 million as a result of increased income tax credits and tax benefits of the higher nonoperating expenses the continuing rise in crude oil prices may initiate the phase out of the synthetic fuel tax credits derived from production of the synthetic fuels and if the credits are phased out the partnerships are expected to cease production based on yeartodate prices of crude oil and expected pricing for the balance of 2006 the corporation anticipates that it could receive only modest benefits if any from these partnerships in 2006

obligations commentary 

  

   

   

   

the above table does not include future payments that the corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions including expected future service to project the future obligations based upon those projections the corporation anticipates making annual payments for these obligations within a range from nearly 85 million in 2006 to more than 95 million by 2015 

  

deferred taxes minority interest and payments related to pension plans are also not included in the table 

  

a consolidated financing subsidiary has issued preferred securities that are in substance perpetual and are callable by the subsidiary in november 2008 and each 20year anniversary thereafter management currently anticipates that these securities will not be called in november 2008 the next call date and therefore they are not included in the above table see item 8 note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these securities

management believes that the corporation’s ability to generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends repurchases of common stock and other needs in the foreseeable future 

  

variable interest entities 

  

the corporation has variable interests in the following financing and real estate entities and in the synthetic fuel partnerships described above 

  

financing entities 

  

as explained in more detail in item 8 note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the corporation holds a significant variable interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize longterm notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets which were sold in 1999 and 1989 to 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

nonaffiliated buyers these sales involved notes receivable which are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks that have an aggregate face value of 617 million 

  

in 1999 the corporation transferred the notes received from the 1999 sale to a noncontrolled financing entity and in 2000 it transferred the notes received from the 1989 sale to another noncontrolled financing entity the corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities collectively the “financing entities” the transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the financing entities were made at fair value were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss in conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets the financing entities became obligated for 617 million in thirdparty debt financing a nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the financing entities has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the financing entities the corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating 662 million and intercompany preferred stock of 50 million to the financing entities which serve as secondary collateral for the thirdparty lending arrangements in the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit the corporation could experience a maximum loss of 617 million under these arrangements 

  

the corporation has not consolidated the financing entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity rather it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting the corporation retains equity interests in the financing entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes as a result the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the corporation’s equity interests in the financing entities for financial reporting purposes 

  

see item 8 note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation’s luxembourgbased financing subsidiary which is consolidated because the corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity 

  

real estate entities 

  

as explained in greater detail in item 8 note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the corporation participates in the us affordable and historic renovation real estate markets through i partnership arrangements in which it is a limited partner ii limited liability companies “llcs” in which it is a nonmanaging member and iii investments in various funds in which the corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors these variable interest entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects 

  

effective march 31 2004 the corporation adopted fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities—an interpretation of arb 51 “fin 46r” for these real estate entities adoption of fin 46r required the corporation to consolidate ten apartment projects and two hotels because it was the primary beneficiary of each of these real estate ventures subsequently three of the apartments and the two hotels became whollyowned by the corporation for the entities that remain consolidated under fin 46r the carrying amount of the assets that serve as collateral for 427 million of obligations of these ventures was 470 million at december 31 2005 

  

the corporation is not the primary beneficiary for the remainder of the real estate entities and has not consolidated them these entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method as appropriate as of december 31 2005 total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was 2558 million a total of 197 million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the corporation except for the guaranteed portion permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

nonrecourse to the corporation from time to time temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the corporation in general the corporation’s interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained at december 31 2005 343 million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the corporation 

  

if the corporation’s investments in its nonconsolidated real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings as of december 31 2005 this recapture risk is estimated to be 345 million the corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need accordingly the recapture risk is considered to be remote 

  

at december 31 2005 the corporation’s maximum loss exposure for its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be 1094 million and is comprised of its net equity in these entities of 209 million its permanent financing guarantees of 197 million its interim financing guarantees of 343 million and the income tax credit recapture risk of 345 million 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the corporation’s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals pension benefits and other postretirement benefits retained insurable risks excess and obsolete inventory allowance for doubtful accounts useful lives for depreciation and amortization future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments and loss contingencies the corporation’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

promotion and rebate accruals 

  

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable end of aisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the corporation’s products promotion accruals as of december 31 2005 and 2004 were 2353 million and 2633 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2005 and 2004 were 1602 million and 1630 million respectively

pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

pension benefits 

  

the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation “abo” subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 

  

nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in such countries 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 1568 million in 2005 compared with 1548 million for 2004 pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 829 percent in 2005 compared with 832 percent in 2004 and will be 828 percent in 2006 the expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors including input from the corporation’s pension investment consultants and projected longterm returns of broad equity and bond indices the us plan’s historical 10year and 15year compounded annual returns of 936 percent and 1028 percent respectively which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices were also considered on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the principal plans are anticipated to generate annual longterm rates of return of at least 85 percent the expected longterm rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers with expected longterm rates of return of approximately 10 percent and 30 percent with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of about 6 percent actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate also when deemed appropriate hedging strategies are executed using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level this hedging strategy was last executed for 2003 no hedging instruments are currently in place longterm rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary 

  

pension expense is determined on the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets are recognized in pension expense more rapidly than they would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets as of december 31 2005 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately 17 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns or ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” determined under sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  

  

the discount or settlement rate used to determine the present value of the corporation’s future us pension obligations at december 31 2005 was based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years each year’s expected future benefit 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rate for us pension obligations for the nonus principal plans discount rates are established using the longterm local government bond rates increased by the interest rate spread between the us discount rate and longterm us government bond rates the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans decreased to 554 percent at december 31 2005 from 577 percent at december 31 2004 

  

consolidated pension expense is estimated to approximate 165 million in 2006 this estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 85 percent a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 554 percent and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2006 will depend on future investment performance the corporation’s contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans the estimated expense for 2006 does not include any potential effects related to subsequent phase projects under the competitive improvement initiatives that have not yet been authorized 

  

if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for the principal plans was lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 9 million if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent annual pension expense would increase by approximately 14 million and the december 31 2005 minimum pension liability would increase by about 158 million 

  

the fair value of the assets in the corporation’s defined benefit plans was 41 billion and 40 billion at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively lower discount rates have caused the projected benefit obligations the “pbo” of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately 14 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively primarily due to the lower discount rates the abo of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about 10 billion and about 9 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively on a consolidated basis the corporation contributed about 117 million to pension trusts in 2005 compared with 200 million in 2004 in addition the corporation made direct benefit payments of 119 million in 2005 compared to 214 million in 2004 while the corporation is not required to make a contribution in 2006 to the us plan the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated the corporation currently anticipates contributing about 80 million to its pension plans outside the us in 2006 

  

the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is identical to the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation’s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

other postretirement benefits 

  

substantially all north american retirees and employees are covered by health care and life insurance benefit plans certain benefits are based on years of service andor age at retirement the plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 and contributory for most employees who retire after 1992 except that the corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003 these plans are not funded until the year in which payments are made for benefit claims 

  

the corporation’s contributions to the plans were 665 million in 2005 compared with 594 million in 2004 the increase was due to a change in the timing of contributions to the plans to better align with the payments of benefit claims the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans are discussed in the pension benefit section above if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 025 percent our annual other postretirement benefit expense would increase by approximately 1 million and the december 31 2005 benefit liability would increase by about 21 million 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

prior to 2004 certain us plans limited the corporation’s cost of future annual per capita retiree medical benefits to no more than 200 percent of the 1992 annual per capita cost these plans reached this limitation the “cap” and were amended during 2003 among other things the amendments index the cap by 3 percent annually beginning in 2005 for certain employees retiring on or before april 1 2004 and limit the corporation’s future cost for retiree health care benefits to a defined fixed per capita cost for certain employees retiring after april 1 2004 

  

the health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including the corporation’s recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace the annual increase in the consolidated weightedaverage health care cost trend rate is expected to be 991 percent in 2006 886 percent in 2007 and to gradually decline to 519 percent in 2011 and thereafter see item 8 note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate 

  

retained insurable risks 

  

selected insurable risks are retained primarily those related to property damage workers’ compensation and product automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events principally related to workers’ compensation and automobile liability are based upon loss development factors provided to the corporation by external insurance brokers and are not discounted 

  

excess and obsolete inventory 

  

all excess obsolete damaged or offquality inventories including raw materials inprocess finished goods and spare parts are required to be adequately reserved for or to be disposed of this process requires an ongoing tracking of the aging of inventories to be reviewed in conjunction with current marketing plans to ensure that any excess or obsolete inventories are identified on a timely basis this process also requires judgments be made about the salability of existing stock in relation to sales projections the evaluation of the adequacy of provision for obsolete and excess inventories is performed on at least a quarterly basis no provisions for future obsolescence damage or offquality inventories are made 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

the allowance for doubtful accounts represents the corporation’s best estimate of the accounts receivable that will not be collected the estimate is based on among other things historical collection experience a review of the current aging status of customer receivables and a review of specific information for those customers that are deemed to be higher risk at the time the corporation becomes aware of a customer whose continued operating success is questionable collection of their receivable balance is closely monitored and the customer may be required to prepay for shipments if a customer enters a bankruptcy action the progress of that action is monitored to determine when and if an additional provision for noncollectibility is warranted the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated on at least a quarterly basis the allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2005 and 2004 was 358 million and 425 million respectively and the writeoff of uncollectible accounts was 150 million and 136 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

property and depreciation 

  

estimating the useful lives of property plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment and actual lives may differ from these estimates changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate property plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such longlived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines future sales volumes growth rates for selling prices and costs alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount the determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

  

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans including the competitive improvement initiatives and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge actual outcomes may differ from the estimates for example if the corporation’s products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and additional impairment charges may be recognized 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of the corporation’s businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes selling prices and costs are also tested if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated if a possible impairment is indicated the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments the corporation’s annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and it has been determined that none of its 27 billion of goodwill is impaired 

  

the corporation has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december 31 2005 the corporation has other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately 277 million and a net carrying amount of about 164 million these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities “vie” 

  

the determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities under fin 46r requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie using a computer simulation model and determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie requires the exercise of significant management judgment the resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each vie in accordance with their beneficial interests the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie under fin 46r 

  

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

  

as of december 31 2005 the corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards totaling 7894 million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 4740 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 3154 million as of december 31 2004 the net deferred tax asset was 2671 million these income tax losses and credits are in nonus taxing jurisdictions in the us for excess foreign tax credits and in certain states within the us in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets the corporation considers many factors including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence the corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2005 united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 37 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 23 accounting for income taxes special areas these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate see item 8 note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of previously unremitted earnings that were repatriated in 2005 under the provisions of the american jobs creation act 

  

the corporation accrues liabilities in current income taxes for potential assessments which at december 31 2005 and 2004 aggregated to 2688 million and 3564 million respectively the accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations the corporation’s us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2003 irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 1998 refund actions are pending with the irs examination division or appeals office for the years 1993 through 1998 management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

loss contingencies 

  

the outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against the corporation are subject to uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies requires that an estimated loss contingency be accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a

business outlook 

  

under its global business plan the corporation expects net sales to continue to benefit from new and improved products and strong growth in developing and emerging markets the corporation is also confident that it will generate additional cost savings in 2006 and beyond and while it is anticipated that inflationary pressures will continue the corporation is intent on delivering sustainable growth in net income the corporation will also remain focused on increasing cash flow from operations and further improving return on invested capital 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain matters discussed in this form 10k or related documents a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference concerning among other things the business outlook including new product introductions cost savings anticipated costs and savings related to the competitive improvement initiatives anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation’s results will be as estimated 

  

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices and availability of the corporation’s raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation’s products energy costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business could impact the realization of such estimates 

  

the factors described under item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k or in our other securities and exchange commission filings among others could cause the corporation’s future results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

as a multinational enterprise the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions the corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 

  

presented below is a description of the corporation’s most significant risks foreign currency risk interest rate risk and commodity price risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect management’s view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward option and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure prior to 2004 foreign currency risk was managed by the selective rather than the systematic use of foreign currency forward option and swap contracts management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2005 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 63 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2005 rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2005 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation’s foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

stockholders’ equity by approximately 528 million these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2005 exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2005 the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 51 percent variablerate debt and 49 percent fixedrate debt the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and is designed to balance the corporation’s cost of financing with its interest rate risk 

  

two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation’s financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2005 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 91 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation’s current level of variablerate debt with respect to commercial paper and other variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the corporation is subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations as previously discussed under item 1a “risk factors” increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

in addition the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in its manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of this risk in accordance with the corporation’s risk management policy 

  

management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation’s business or its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

kimberlyclark corporation 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that kimberlyclark corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

recent developments 

  

the corporation is a global health and hygiene company focused on building its personal care consumer tissue and businesstobusiness operations since 2000 the corporation has completed 14 acquisitions each of which was accounted for as a purchase in its core businesses and three strategic divestitures including the following transactions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in january 2004 the corporation announced changes to reorganize its personal care and consumer tissue businesses into two separate north atlantic personal care and consumer tissue groups and to put its operations in developing and emerging markets into one group the wet wipes business became part of the personal care segment instead of the consumer tissue segment in addition the corporation’s north american pulp operations

continued 

  

were included in its businesstobusiness segment the corporation continues to have three global businesses led by individuals who have the accountability and the authority to make global decisions the goal of this new structure is to help increase the corporation’s speed in translating consumer and customer insights into innovative products to streamline decision making and to help deliver cost reductions on a sustainable basis 

  

primarily as a result of significant productivity gains the corporation had available diaper manufacturing capacity in north america and europe therefore the corporation executed a plan to cease diaper manufacturing and scaleback distribution operations at its facility in new milford conn which now is focused solely on the production of tissue products some diaper production capacity was also redeployed from the bartonuponhumber facility in the uk diaper machines from these locations will now support growth in other markets thereby reducing the capital spending required for this business these steps are consistent with the corporation’s strategies to drive growth in developing and emerging markets and improve its cost structure in north america and europe costs to implement this plan total approximately 40 million before tax including about 37 million recorded in 2004 the balance of the plan costs will be recorded in 2005 as they are incurred

employees

factors that may affect future results 

  

certain matters discussed in this form 10k or documents a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference concerning among other things the business outlook including new product introductions cost savings anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking statements and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation’s results will be as estimated 

  

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices and availability of the corporation’s raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation’s products energy costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business also could impact the realization of such estimates 

  

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10k or in other sec filings among others could cause the corporation’s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation 

  

these factors are described in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 which encourages companies to disclose such factors 

  

competitive environment the corporation experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets both domestically and internationally the corporation’s products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label products which are typically sold at lower prices the corporation has several major competitors in most of its markets some of which are larger and more diversified than the corporation the principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty product innovation quality and performance price and marketing and distribution capabilities inherent risks in the corporation’s competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of recent consolidations of retailers and distribution channels and competitive reaction aggressive competitive reaction may lead to increased advertising and promotional spending by the corporation in order to maintain market share increased competition with respect to pricing would reduce revenue and could have an adverse impact on the corporation’s financial results in addition the corporation relies on the development and introduction of new or improved products as a means of achieving andor maintaining category leadership in order to maintain its competitive position the corporation must develop technology to support its products 

  

cost savings strategy the corporation’s anticipated cost savings are expected to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments the corporation’s strategic investments in its information systems should also allow further cost savings through streamlining of its back office operations there can be no assurance that such cost savings will be achieved

continued 

  

raw materials cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered pulp is used extensively in the corporation’s tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the pulp markets recycled fiber accounts for approximately 28 percent of the corporation’s overall fiber requirements 

  

on a worldwide basis prior to the spinoff the corporation supplied approximately 40 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations the spinoff has reduced the internal pulp supply to approximately 10 percent this reduction in pulp integration could increase the corporation’s commodity price risk specifically increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

a number of the corporation’s products such as diapers training and youth pants and incontinence care products contain certain materials which are principally derived from petroleum these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices availability and other factors the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials 

  

although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could materially affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials 

  

energy costs the corporation’s manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to ensure that it uses all forms of energy cost effectively the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites the corporation’s contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration kimberlyclark’s energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of natural gas price risk when management deems it prudent to do so 

  

volume forecasting the corporation’s anticipated financial results reflect forecasts of future volume increases in the sales of its products challenges in such forecasting include anticipating consumer preferences estimating sales of new products estimating changes in population characteristics such as birth rates and changes in per capita income anticipating changes in technology and competitive responses and estimating the acceptance of the corporation’s products in new markets as a result there can be no assurance that the corporation’s volume increases will occur as estimated 

  

foreign market risks because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries the corporation’s results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries the extremely competitive situation in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic environments in argentina brazil colombia mexico venezuela and developing countries in eastern europe asia and elsewhere in latin america may slow the corporation’s sales growth and earnings potential in addition the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar exposures arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currencies are systematically hedged through foreign currency forward option and swap contracts see item 7a “management’s discussion and analysis – risk sensitivity” translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations is not hedged there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations

contingencies the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with certainty although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

one of the corporation’s north american tissue mills has an agreement to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next 12 years in the event that the mill was shut down the corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of its owner the local utility company the net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of december 31 2004 is estimated to be approximately 120 million management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote

additional income statement commentary 

  

synthetic fuel partnerships 

  

in april 2003 the corporation acquired a 495 percent minority interest in a synthetic fuel partnership in october 2004 the corporation acquired a 49 percent minority interest in an additional synthetic fuel partnership these partnerships are variable interest entities that are subject to the requirements of fin 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51 “fin 46r” although these partnerships are variable interest entities “vies” the corporation is not the primary beneficiary and the entities have not been consolidated synthetic fuel produced by the partnerships is eligible for synthetic fuel tax credits through 2007 

  

the production of synthetic fuel results in pretax losses in 2004 and 2003 these pretax losses totaled 1584 million and 1055 million respectively and are reported as nonoperating expense on the corporation’s 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

income statement the synthetic fuel tax credits as well as tax deductions for the nonoperating losses reduce the corporation’s income tax expense in 2004 and 2003 the corporation’s participation in the synthetic fuel partnership resulted in 1444 million and 941 million of tax credits respectively and the nonoperating losses generated an additional 554 million and 372 million respectively of tax benefits which combined to reduce the corporation’s income tax provision by 1998 million and 1313 million respectively the effect of these benefits increased net income by 414 million 08 per share in 2004 and 258 million 05 per share in 2003 the effects of these tax credits are shown separately in the corporation’s reconciliation of the us statutory rate to its effective income tax rate in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

because the partnerships have received favorable private letter rulings from the irs and because the partnerships’ test procedures conform to irs guidance the corporation’s loss exposure under the synthetic fuel partnerships is minimal

part ii 

continued 

  

obligations commentary 

  

   

   

the above table does not include future payments that the corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions including expected future service to project the future obligations based upon those projections the corporation anticipates making payments for these obligations within a range from approximately 80 million in 2005 to more than 90 million by 2014 

  

the table also does not include anticipated payments related to the synthetic fuel partnerships such payments will only be made if the partnerships produce synthetic fuel in future years the corporation estimates that it will make payments to these partnerships of approximately 160 million in 2005 2006 and 2007 and will receive income tax benefits and credits in excess of these amounts 

  

deferred taxes minority interest and payments related to pension plans are also not included in the table 

  

a consolidated financing subsidiary has issued preferred securities that are in substance perpetual and are callable by the subsidiary in november 2008 and each 20year anniversary thereafter management currently anticipates that these securities will not be called in november 2008 the next call date and therefore they are not included in the above table see financing commentary below and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail regarding these securities

financing commentary 

  

   

   

part ii

management believes that the corporation’s ability to generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue shortterm and longterm debt are adequate to fund working capital capital spending payment of dividends repurchases of common stock and other needs in the foreseeable future 

  

variable interest entities 

  

the corporation has variable interests in the following financing and real estate entities and in the synthetic fuel partnerships described above 

  

financing entities 

  

the corporation holds a significant variable interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize longterm notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets which were sold in 1999 and 1989 to nonaffiliated buyers these transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in sfas 66 accounting for sales of real estate  these sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of 617 million and a fair value of approximately 593 million at the date of sale the notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks which aggregated 617 million at december 31 2004 

  

because the corporation desired to monetize the 617 million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains in 1999 the corporation transferred the notes received from the 1999 sale to a noncontrolled financing entity and in 2000 it transferred the notes received from the 1989 sale to another noncontrolled financing entity the corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

collectively the “financing entities” the transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the financing entities were made at fair value were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss in conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets the financing entities became obligated for 617 million in thirdparty debt financing a nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the financing entities has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the financing entities the corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating 662 million and intercompany preferred stock of 50 million to the financing entities which serve as secondary collateral for the thirdparty lending arrangements in the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit the corporation could experience a maximum loss of 617 million under these arrangements 

  

the corporation has not consolidated the financing entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity rather it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting the corporation retains equity interests in the financing entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes as a result the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the corporation’s equity interests in the financing entities for financial reporting purposes 

  

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation’s luxembourgbased financing subsidiary which is consolidated because the corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity 

  

real estate entities 

  

effective march 31 2004 the corporation adopted fin 46r for its real estate entities described below in 1994 the corporation began participating in the us affordable and historic renovation real estate markets investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the united states congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations accordingly these investments generate income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the corporation’s income tax liabilities the corporation has invested in these markets through i partnership arrangements in which it is a limited partner ii limited liability companies “llcs” in which it is a nonmanaging member and iii investments in various funds in which the corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors these entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects 

  

adoption of fin 46r required the corporation to consolidate ten apartment projects and two hotels because it was the primary beneficiary of each of these real estate ventures the carrying amount of the assets that serve as collateral for 984 million of obligations of these ventures was 1475 million at december 31 2004 and these assets are classified as property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet the corporation also has guaranteed 146 million of the obligations of these ventures 

  

the corporation accounts for its interests in real estate entities that are not consolidated under fin 46r by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method as appropriate and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in its income tax provision as of december 31 2004 the corporation had a net equity of 212 million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities the corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately 718 million 593 million and 499 million for december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively as of december 31 2004 total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was 2219 million a total of 76 million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the corporation and the remainder of this debt is not supported or guaranteed by the corporation except for the guaranteed portion permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the corporation from time to time temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

corporation in general the corporation’s interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained at december 31 2004 279 million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the corporation 

  

if the corporation’s investments in its nonconsolidated real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings as of december 31 2004 this recapture risk is estimated to be 311 million the corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need accordingly the recapture risk is considered to be remote 

  

at december 31 2004 the corporation’s maximum loss exposure for its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be 878 million and was comprised of its net equity in these entities of 212 million its permanent financing guarantees of 76 million its interim financing guarantees of 279 million and the income tax credit recapture risk of 311 million

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the corporation’s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals pension benefits retained insurable risks excess and obsolete inventory allowance for doubtful accounts useful lives for depreciation and amortization future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments and contingencies the corporation’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

promotion and rebate accruals 

  

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable end of aisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the corporation’s products promotion accruals as of december 31 2004 and 2003 were 2633 million and 2220 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2004 and 2003 were 1630 million and 1364 million respectively

pension benefits 

  

the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation “abo” subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in such countries 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 1548 million in 2004 compared with 1659 million for 2003 pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 832 percent in 2004 compared with 842 percent in 2003 and will be 829 percent in 2005 the expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors including input from our pension investment consultants and projected longterm returns of broad equity and bond indices we also considered our us plan’s historical 10year and 15year compounded annual returns of 1092 percent and 966 percent respectively which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices we anticipate that on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the principal plans will generate annual longterm rates of return of at least 85 percent our expected longterm rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers with expected longterm rates of return of approximately 10 percent and 30 percent with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of about 6 percent we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate also when deemed appropriate we execute hedging strategies using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level we executed such hedging strategies in 2003 and 2002 no hedging instruments are currently in place we will continue to evaluate our longterm rate of return assumptions at least annually and will adjust them as necessary 

  

we determine pension expense on the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets we recognize the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets in pension expense more rapidly than we would if we used a calculated value for plan assets as of december 31 2004 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately 17 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns or ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” determined under sfas 87 employers’ accounting for pensions 

  

the discount or settlement rate we used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligations at december 31 2004 was based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years each year’s expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rate for our us pension obligations for our nonus principal plans we established discount rates 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

using the longterm local government bond rates increased by the interest rate spread between the us discount rate and longterm us government bond rates the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans decreased to 577 percent at december 31 2004 from 597 percent at december 31 2003 

  

we estimate that our consolidated pension expense will approximate 160 million in 2005 this estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 850 percent a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 577 percent and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2005 will depend on future investment performance the corporation’s contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

  

if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for our principal plans was lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 9 million if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 13 million and our december 31 2004 minimum pension liability would increase by about 147 million 

  

the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was 40 billion at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 lower discount rates have caused the projected benefit obligations the “pbo” of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately 12 billion at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 primarily due to the lower discount rates the abo of our defined benefit plans exceeded plan assets by about 9 billion at the end of 2004 at the end of 2003 the abo exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about 8 billion on a consolidated basis the corporation contributed about 200 million to pension trusts in 2004 compared with 1819 million in 2003 in addition the corporation made direct benefit payments of 214 million in 2004 compared to 297 million in 2003 while the corporation is not required to make a contribution in 2005 to the us plan the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated about 38 million will be contributed to plans outside the us in 2005 

  

the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is identical to the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation’s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

retained insurable risks 

  

we retain selected insurable risks primarily related to property damage workers’ compensation and product automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability are based upon loss development factors provided to us by our external insurance brokers 

  

excess and obsolete inventory 

  

we require all excess obsolete damaged or offquality inventories including raw materials inprocess finished goods and spare parts to be adequately reserved for or to be disposed of our process requires an ongoing tracking of the aging of inventories to be reviewed in conjunction with current marketing plans to ensure that any excess or obsolete inventories are identified on a timely basis this process requires judgments be made about the salability of existing stock in relation to sales projections the evaluation of the adequacy of provision for obsolete and excess inventories is performed on at least a quarterly basis no provisions for future obsolescence damage or offquality inventories are made 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents our best estimate of the accounts receivable that will not be collected we base our estimate on among other things historical collection experience a review of the current aging status of customer receivables and a review of specific information for those customers that are deemed to be higher risk when we become aware of a customer whose continued operating success is questionable we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for current shipments if a customer enters a bankruptcy action we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for noncollectibility is warranted we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis the allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2004 and 2003 was 425 million and 479 million respectively and our writeoff of uncollectible accounts was 136 million and 155 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

property and depreciation 

  

estimating the useful lives of property plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment and actual lives may differ from these estimates changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate property plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such longlived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines future sales volumes growth rates for selling prices and costs alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

  

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge actual outcomes may differ from the estimates for example if our products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized then our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

we test the carrying amount of goodwill annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes growth rates of selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate we also test the sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes selling prices and costs if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

impairment would be indicated if a possible impairment is indicated we would estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be recorded we also use judgment in assessing whether we need to test more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments we have completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and have determined that none of our 27 billion of goodwill is impaired 

  

we have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives we have other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately 276 million and a net carrying amount of about 185 million these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows we use judgment in assessing whether the carrying amount of our intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

  

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities 

  

the determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities under fin 46r requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie using a computer simulation model determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie requires the exercise of significant management judgment the resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each vie in accordance with their beneficial interests the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie under fin 46r 

  

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

  

as of december 31 2004 the corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards totaling 5195 million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 2524 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 2671 million as of december 31 2003 the net deferred tax asset was 2201 million these income tax losses and credits are in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states within the us in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets the corporation considers many factors including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence the corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2004 united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 40 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion 23 accounting for income taxes special areas these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate the

corporation currently is evaluating the effect of the american jobs creation act on the unremitted earnings of its nonus subsidiaries and expects to complete that evaluation by june 30 2005 at this time it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of unremitted earnings that may be repatriated and the income tax effects of such repatriation 

  

the corporation records liabilities in current income taxes for potential assessments the accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations the corporation’s us federal income tax returns have been audited through 2001 irs assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 1998 refund actions are pending in federal district court or the irs appeals office for the years 1987 through 1998 management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

contingencies and legal matters 

  

litigation 

  

the following is a brief description of certain legal and administrative proceedings to which the corporation or its subsidiaries is a party or to which the corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ properties are subject in management’s opinion none of the legal and administrative proceedings described below individually or in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

as of december 31 2004 the corporation along with many other nonaffiliated companies was a party to lawsuits with allegations of personal injury resulting from asbestos exposure on the defendants’ premises and allegations that the defendants manufactured sold distributed or installed products which cause asbestosrelated lung disease these general allegations are often made against the corporation without any apparent evidence or identification of a specific product or premises of the corporation the corporation has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of these asbestos cases all asbestos claims have been tendered to the corporation’s insurance carriers for defense and indemnity the financial statements reflect appropriate accruals for the corporation’s portion of the costs estimated to be incurred in connection with resolving these claims 

  

contingency 

  

one of the corporation’s north american tissue mills has an agreement to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next 12 years in the event that the mill was shut down the corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of its owner the local utility company the net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of december 31 2004 is estimated to be approximately 120 million management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote 

  

environmental matters 

  

the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of which individually or in the aggregate in management’s opinion is likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

new accounting standards 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas 151 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses freight handling costs and spoilage it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the normal capacity of production facilities sfas 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 adoption of sfas 151 will not have a material effect on the corporation’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” which revises sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  sfas 123r also supersedes apb 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas 95 statement of cash flows  in general the accounting required by sfas 123r is similar to that of sfas 123 however sfas 123 gave companies a choice to either recognize the fair value of stock options in their income statements or to disclose the pro forma income statement effect of the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements sfas 123r eliminates that choice and requires the fair value of all sharebased payments to employees including the fair value of grants of employee stock options be recognized in the income statement generally over the option vesting period sfas 123r must be adopted no later than july 1 2005 early adoption is permitted 

  

sfas 123r permits adoption of its requirements using one of two transition methods 

  

1 a modified prospective transition “mpt” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 

  

2 a modified retrospective transition “mrt” method which includes the requirements of the mpt method described above but also permits restatement of financial statements based on the amounts previously disclosed under sfas 123’s pro forma disclosure requirements either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 

  

the corporation is currently evaluating the timing and manner in which it will adopt sfas 123r 

  

as permitted by sfas 123 the corporation currently accounts for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25’s intrinsic value method and as such has recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method will have a slight effect on results of operations although it will have no impact on overall financial position the impact of adoption of sfas 123r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of sharebased payments granted in the future however had sfas 123r been adopted in prior periods the effect would have approximated the sfas 123 pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures shown in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption while those amounts cannot be estimated for future periods because they depend on among other things when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of the corporation’s stock at the time of exercise the amount of operating cash flows generated in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was 309 million 74 million and 99 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

business outlook 

  

for 2005 the corporation is targeting sales growth of 3 to 5 percent consistent with its longterm objective based on plans to drive innovation the gain is expected to come largely from improvement in sales volumes 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

with price mix and currency assumed to be about flat the corporation is targeting to deliver 150 million in cost savings which should help improve operating profit margin by up to 20 basis points despite inflationary cost increases the corporation expects to deliver earnings of 370 to 385 per share for the year representing mid to high singledigit growth compared with net income from continuing operations of 355 in 2004 

  

cash flow is expected to continue to be strong which will enable the corporation to again return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in 2005 common share repurchases are currently targeted to be at least 1 billion during the year and dividends on common stock have been increased by 125 percent effective with the april payment capital spending is estimated to be 800 million in 2005 which should be toward the low end of the corporation’s longterm target of 5 to 6 percent of net sales 

  

for the first quarter of 2005 earnings are expected to be in a range of 92 to 94 cents per share compared with earnings per share from continuing operations of 88 cents in 2004 this would represent growth of approximately 5 to 7 percent similar to the expected level of improvement for the full year the corporation is planning to step up its marketing spending in the quarter compared with the prior year to support a very active schedule of product launches including huggies toiletries new pullups training pants with wetness indicators and scott extra soft bathroom tissue the corporation also expects to face continued cost increases in the first quarter particularly for fiber as well as resin and other oilbased materials 

  

information concerning forwardlooking statements 

  

certain matters discussed in this report concerning among other things the business outlook including new product introductions cost savings anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking statements and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation’s results will be as estimated 

  

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices and availability of the corporation’s raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation’s products and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business also could impact the realization of such estimates 

  

for a description of these and other factors that could cause the corporation’s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forwardlooking statements see item i of this annual report on form 10k entitled “factors that may affect future results”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

as a multinational enterprise the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions the corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to these agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

presented below is a description of our most significant risks foreign currency risk interest rate risk and commodity price risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward option and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure prior to 2004 foreign currency risk was managed by the selective rather than the systematic use of foreign currency forward option and swap contracts management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we perform an annual test to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current yearend the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2004 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 43 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2004 rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of our nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently we perform an annual test to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2004 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders’ equity by approximately 638 million these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2004 exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

deems appropriate at december 31 2004 the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 35 percent variablerate debt and 65 percent fixedrate debt the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a target mix of fixed and floating rate debt the corporation’s target for variable rate debt is 40 percent to 50 percent and is designed to balance the corporation’s cost of financing with its interest rate risk 

  

we perform two separate tests to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on our consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on our fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2004 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 110 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variablerate debt with respect to commercial paper and other variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the corporation is subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined by industry supply and demand on a worldwide basis prior to the spinoff the corporation supplied approximately 40 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations the spinoff has reduced the internal pulp supply to approximately 10 percent as previously discussed under factors that may affect future results increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

in addition the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in its manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of this risk when it is deemed prudent to do so by management 

  

management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation’s business or its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

as of december 31 2004 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the corporation’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures based on that evaluation the corporation’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2004 

  

internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on the financial statements 

  

kimberlyclark corporation’s management is responsible for all aspects of the business including the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report the consolidated financial statements have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles considered appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis management also has prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements 

  

as can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment some financial statement amounts are based on estimates and judgments even though estimates and judgments are used measures have been taken to provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial information contained in this annual report these measures include an effective controloriented environment in which the internal audit function plays an important role and an audit committee of the board of directors that oversees the financial reporting process 

  

the consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp during their audits deloitte  touche llp was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data including minutes of all meetings of stockholders and the board of directors and all committees of the board management believes that all representations made to the independent registered public accountants during their audits were valid and appropriate 

  

audit committee oversight and the corporation’s code of conduct

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition use or disposition this system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial statements and safeguarding of the corporation’s assets this system is supported with written policies and procedures contains selfmonitoring mechanisms and is audited by the internal audit function appropriate actions are taken by management to correct deficiencies as they are identified all internal control systems have inherent limitations including the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial statement preparation and such asset safeguarding 

  

the corporation has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making this assessment it used the criteria described in “internal control—integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2004 the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

kimberlyclark corporation 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that kimberlyclark corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

patents and trademarks  the corporation owns various patents and trademarks registered domestically and in many foreign countries the corporation considers the patents and trademarks which it owns and the trademarks under which it sells certain of its products to be material to its business consequently the corporation seeks patent and trademark protection by all available means including registration 

  

raw materials  superabsorbent materials are important components in disposable diapers training and youth pants and incontinence care products polypropylene and other synthetics and chemicals are the primary raw materials for manufacturing nonwoven fabrics which are used in disposable diapers training and youth pants wet wipes feminine pads incontinence and health care products and awayfromhome wipers 

  

cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or fiber recycled from recovered pulp is the primary raw material for the corporation’s tissue and paper products and is an important component in disposable diapers training pants feminine pads and incontinence care products 

  

most recovered paper and synthetics are purchased from third parties pulp and recycled fiber are produced by the corporation and purchased from others the corporation considers the supply of such raw materials to be adequate to meet the needs of its businesses see “factors that may affect future results—raw materials” 

  

the corporation owns or controls approximately 59 million acres of forestland in canada principally as a fiber source for pulp production which is consumed internally for tissue products approximately 10 million acres in the province of nova scotia are owned by the corporation and approximately 49 million acres principally in the province of ontario are held under longterm crown rights or leases as part of the pulp and paper spinoff described above the corporation is evaluating divesting its interest in the canadian forestlands 

  

competition  for a discussion of the competitive environment in which the corporation conducts its business see “factors that may affect future results—competitive environment”

total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material effect on the corporation’s total capital and operating expenditures consolidated earnings or competitive position however current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in the corporation’s plans changes in legal requirements or other factors 

  

employees  in its worldwide consolidated operations the corporation had nearly 62000 employees as of december 31 2003 

  

factors that may affect future results 

  

certain matters discussed in this form 10k or documents a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference concerning among other things the business outlook including new product introductions cost savings anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking statements and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation’s results will be as estimated 

  

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices of the corporation’s raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation’s products and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business also could impact the realization of such estimates 

  

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10k or in other sec filings among others could cause the corporation’s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation 

  

such factors are described in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 which encourages companies to disclose such factors 

  

competitive environment  the corporation experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets both domestically and internationally the corporation’s products compete with widely advertised wellknown branded products as well as private label products which are typically sold at lower prices the corporation has several major competitors in most of its markets some of which are larger and more diversified than the corporation the principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty product innovation quality and performance price and marketing and distribution 

  

part i 

continued 

  

capabilities inherent risks in the corporation’s competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the effects of recent consolidations of retailers and distribution channels and competitive reaction aggressive competitive reaction may lead to increased advertising and promotional spending by the corporation in order to maintain market share increased competition with respect to pricing would reduce revenue and could have an adverse impact on the corporation’s financial results in addition the corporation relies on the development and introduction of new or improved products as a means of achieving andor maintaining category leadership in order to maintain its competitive position the corporation must develop technology to support its products 

  

cost savings strategy  the corporation’s anticipated cost savings are expected to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments the corporation’s strategic investments in its information systems should also allow further cost savings through streamlining of its back office operations there can be no assurance that such cost savings will be achieved 

  

raw materials  cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered pulp is used extensively in the corporation’s tissue and paper products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the pulp markets recycled fiber accounts for approximately 28 percent of the corporation’s overall fiber requirements on a worldwide basis the corporation’s internally manufactured pulp supplies approximately 40 percent of its virgin fiber requirements 

  

the corporation still intends to reduce its level of pulp integration when market conditions permit and such a reduction in pulp integration if accomplished could increase the corporation’s commodity price risk if the pulp and paper spinoff described above in recent developments occurs it would significantly reduce the level of the corporation’s pulp integration specifically increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 

  

polymer resins principally polypropylene are used extensively in the corporation’s products such as diapers training and youth pants and incontinence care products polymer resins which are principally derived from petroleum may be subject to price fluctuations the corporation purchases polymer resins from a number of suppliers significant increases in resin prices could adversely affect the corporation’s earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in resin prices 

  

energy costs  the corporation’s manufacturing operations utilize electricity natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to insure that it uses all forms of energy costeffectively the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites and also provides expert staff assistance to operating units in negotiating favorable utility and other energy supply agreements the corporation’s contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price payment terms quantities and duration kimberlyclark’s energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources derivative instruments are used to hedge natural gas price risk when management deems it prudent to do so 

  

volume forecasting  the corporation’s anticipated financial results reflect forecasts of future volume increases in the sales of its products challenges in such forecasting include anticipating consumer preferences estimating sales of new products estimating changes in population characteristics such as birth rates and changes in per capita income anticipating changes in technology and competitive responses and estimating the 

  

part i 

continued 

  

acceptance of the corporation’s products in new markets as a result there can be no assurance that the corporation’s volume increases will occur as estimated 

  

foreign market risks  because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 41 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries the corporation’s results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries the extremely competitive situation in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic environments in argentina brazil colombia mexico venezuela and developing countries in eastern europe asia and elsewhere in latin america may slow the corporation’s sales growth and earnings potential in addition the corporation is subject to the strengthening and weakening of various currencies against each other and versus the us dollar transaction exposure arising from transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currency is selectively hedged through foreign currency forward option and swap contracts see item 7a “management’s discussion and analysis—risk sensitivity” translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations is generally not hedged there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations 

  

contingencies  the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with certainty although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected see item 3 “legal proceedings” 

  

one of the corporation’s north american tissue mills has an agreement to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next 15 years in the event that the mill was shut down the corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of its owner the local utility company the net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of december 31 2003 is estimated to be approximately 100 million management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote

in 2002 we established a team to investigate and to pursue actions to recover these losses in the second quarter of 2002 evidence was discovered to suggest fraud by at least one employee of our affiliates and possibly several others in connection with the tax credit purchases we determined that the remaining purchased tax credits were invalid and that the collateral backing them was worthless we had previously concluded during the december 2001 review based on the advice of our outside advisors that these credits represented legitimate tax credits accordingly in the second quarter of 2002 we recorded a charge of 265 million to other expense for losses associated with these tax credits we have no remaining financial exposure for purchased tax credits 

  

we have implemented various corrective actions to prevent this matter from recurring in the future including terminating all the employees responsible for the decisions to purchase these tax credits

we have also filed civil and criminal actions against a former employee third parties ie intermediaries who sold or arranged for our affiliates’ purchase of tax credits tax credit sellers and legal counsel associated with the purchase of the tax credits

additional income statement commentary 

  

synthetic fuel partnership 

  

in april 2003 the corporation entered into an agreement whereby it acquired a 495 percent minority interest in a synthetic fuel partnership the partnership is a variable interest entity that will become subject to the requirements of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation fin 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51 “fin 46r” as of march 31 2004 the transaction was subject to the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the partnership is eligible for synthetic fuel tax credits the partnership received the favorable letter ruling on october 31 2003 the partnership’s test procedures are in compliance with the requirements outlined by the irs these tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel produced after 2007 

  

the production of synthetic fuel results in pretax losses in 2003 these pretax losses totaled 1055 million and are reported as nonoperating expense on the corporation’s income statement the production of synthetic fuel results in tax credits as well as tax deductions for the nonoperating losses which reduce the corporation’s income tax expense in 2003 the corporation’s participation in the synthetic fuel partnership resulted in 941 million of tax credits and the nonoperating losses generated an additional 372 million of tax benefits which combined to reduce the corporation’s income tax provision by 1313 million the tax benefits and credits related to the operation of the partnership increased net income by 258 million or 05 per share the tax credits are shown as a reconciling item in the corporation’s reconciliation of the us statutory rate to its effective income tax rate in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

because the partnership has received the favorable private letter ruling from the irs and because the partnership’s test procedures conform to irs procedures the corporation believes its loss exposure under the synthetic fuel partnership is minimal application of fin 46r to this entity is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation’s consolidated financial statements

on december 29 2003 the corporation announced the repurchase of 40 million of industrial revenue development bonds to be effective february 2 2004 at december 31 2003 the corporation classified the 40 million as debt payable within one year and reduced longterm debt by that same amount 

  

   

variable interest entities 

  

the corporation has variable interests in the following financing and real estate entities and a synthetic fuel partnership see synthetic fuel partnership 

  

financing entities 

  

the corporation holds a significant variable interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize longterm notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets which were sold in 1999 and 1989 to nonaffiliated buyers these transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in sfas 66 accounting for sales of real estate  these sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of 617 million and a fair value of approximately 593 million at the date of sale the notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks which aggregated 617 million at december 31 2003 

  

because the corporation desired to monetize the 617 million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains in 1999 the corporation transferred the notes received from the 1999 sale to a noncontrolled financing entity and in 2000 it transferred the notes received from the 1989 sale to another 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

noncontrolled financing entity the corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities collectively the “financing entities” the transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the financing entities were made at fair value were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss in conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets the financing entities became obligated for 617 million in thirdparty debt financing a nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the financing entities has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the financing entities the corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating 662 million and intercompany preferred stock of 50 million to the financing entities which serve as secondary collateral for the thirdparty lending arrangements in the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit the corporation could experience a maximum loss of 617 million under these arrangements 

  

the corporation has not consolidated the financing entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity rather it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting the corporation retains equity interests in the financing entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes as a result the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the corporation’s equity interests in the financing entities for financial reporting purposes 

  

see financing commentary above for a description of the corporation’s luxembourgbased financing subsidiary which is consolidated because the corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity 

  

real estate entities 

  

the corporation holds a significant variable interest in certain real estate entities that will become subject to the requirements of fin 46r as of march 31 2004 following is a description of these real estate entities in 1994 the corporation began participating in the us affordable and historic renovation real estate markets investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the united states congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations accordingly these investments generate income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the corporation’s income tax liabilities the corporation has invested in these markets through i partnership arrangements in which it is a limited partner ii limited liability companies “llcs” in which it is a nonmanaging member and iii investments in various funds in which the corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors these entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects 

  

the corporation is still evaluating the effect of fin 46r on its real estate entities if the corporation is determined to be the primary beneficiary of any of these real estate entities it will consolidate such entity as of march 31 2004 in the december 31 2003 financial statements the corporation has accounted for its interests in the real estate entities by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method as appropriate and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in the income tax provision as of december 31 2003 the corporation had a net equity of 1325 million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities income tax credits totaling approximately 115 million will be claimed on the corporation’s income tax returns through december 31 2003 as of december 31 2003 total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was 284 million a total of 312 million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the corporation and the remainder of this debt is not supported or guaranteed by the corporation except for the guaranteed portion permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the corporation from time to time temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the corporation in general the corporation’s interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained at december 31 2003 75 million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the corporation 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

if the corporation’s investments in these real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings as of december 31 2003 this recapture risk is estimated to be 57 million the corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need accordingly the recapture risk is considered to be remote 

  

at december 31 2003 the corporation’s maximum loss exposure for its real estate entities is estimated to be 228 million and was composed of its net equity in these entities of 1325 million its permanent financing guarantees of 312 million its interim financing guarantees of 75 million and the income tax credit recapture risk of 57 million management believes the likelihood of loss on these projects is not material due to the current economic returns on these projects 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates and changes in these estimates are recorded when known the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the corporation’s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals pension benefits retained insurable risks excess and obsolete inventory allowance for doubtful accounts useful lives for depreciation and amortization future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and longlived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments and contingencies the corporation’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors

among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions and rebates are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers and the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers generally we base our estimates for consumer coupon costs on historical patterns of coupon redemption influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions favorable end of aisle or instore product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the corporation’s products promotion accruals as of december 31 2003 and 2002 were 2220 million and 2277 million respectively rebate accruals as of december 31 2003 and 2002 were 1364 million and 1595 million respectively 

  

pension benefits 

  

the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the “principal plans” andor defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or in certain countries 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation “abo” subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements tax considerations investment opportunities and customary business practices in such countries 

  

consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was 168 million in 2003 compared with 32 million for 2002 pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans the weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 842 percent in 2003 compared with 919 percent in 2002 and will be 832 percent in 2004 the expected longterm rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors including input from our pension investment consultants and projected longterm returns of broad equity and bond indices we also considered our us plan’s historical 10year and 15year compounded annual returns of 101 percent and 103 percent respectively which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices we anticipate that on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the principal plans will generate annual longterm rates of return of at least 85 percent our expected longterm rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers with expected longterm rates of return of approximately 10 percent and 30 percent with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of about 6 percent we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate also when deemed appropriate we execute hedging strategies using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level we executed such hedging strategies in 2003 2002 and 2001 no hedging instruments are currently in place beyond january 2004 we will continue to evaluate our longterm rate of return assumptions at least annually and will adjust them as necessary 

  

we determine pension expense on the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses “calculated value” over a period of years investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets we recognize the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets in pension expense more rapidly than we would if we used a calculated value for plan assets as of december 31 2003 the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately 16 billion these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns or ii other factors including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the “corridor” determined under sfas 87 employers’ accounting for pensions 

  

the discount or settlement rate that we utilize for determining the present value of future pension obligations generally has been based in the us on the yield reported for the longterm aarated corporate bond indexes converted to an equivalent oneyear compound basis from timetotime and most recently at december 31 2002 we validated this practice by assembling a hypothetical portfolio of highquality debt securities where the portfolio cash flows correspond to expected future benefit payments we use similar techniques for establishing the discount rates for our nonus principal plans the weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans decreased to 597 percent at december 31 2003 from 668 percent at december 31 2002 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

we estimate that our consolidated pension expense will approximate 180 million in 2004 this estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weightedaverage longterm rate of return on assets in the principal plans of 850 percent a weightedaverage discount rate for the principal plans of 597 percent and various other assumptions pension expense beyond 2004 will depend on future investment performance the corporation’s contributions to the pension trusts changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

  

if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for our principal plans was lowered by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 9 million if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 025 percent our annual pension expense would increase by approximately 13 million and our december 31 2003 minimum pension liability would increase by about 142 million 

  

the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans increased from 34 billion at december 31 2002 to 40 billion at december 31 2003 primarily due to investment gains and plan contributions exceeding payments for pension benefits and plan expenses lower discount rates have caused the projected benefit obligations the “pbo” of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately 12 billion at december 31 2003 compared with approximately 10 billion at december 31 2002 primarily due to the lower discount rates the abo of our defined benefit plans exceeded plan assets by about 8 billion at the end of 2003 at the end of 2002 the abo exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about 7 billion on a consolidated basis the corporation contributed about 184 million to pension trusts in 2003 compared with 126 million in 2002 in addition the corporation made direct benefit payments of 297 million in 2003 compared to 122 million in 2002 we estimate that the corporation will contribute about 100 million to pension trusts in 2004 

  

the discount rate used for each country’s pension obligation is identical to the discount rate used for that country’s other postretirement obligation the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation’s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weightedaverage discount rates 

  

retained insurable risks 

  

we retain selected insurable risks primarily related to property damage workers compensation and product automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management’s judgment of cost effective risk retention accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability are based upon loss development factors provided to us by our external insurance brokers 

  

excess and obsolete inventory 

  

we require all excess obsolete damaged or offquality inventories including raw materials inprocess finished goods and spare parts to be adequately reserved for or to be disposed of our process requires an ongoing tracking of the aging of inventories to be reviewed in conjunction with current marketing plans to ensure that any excess or obsolete inventories are identified on a timely basis this process requires judgments be made about the salability of existing stock in relation to sales projections the evaluation of the adequacy of provision for obsolete and excess inventories is performed on at least a quarterly basis no provisions for future anticipated obsolescence damage or offquality inventories are made 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents our best estimate of the accounts receivable that will ultimately not be collected we base our estimate on among other things historical collection 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

experience a review of the current aging status of customer receivables and a review of specific information for those customers that are deemed to be higher risk when we become aware of a customer whose continued operating success is questionable we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for current shipments if a customer enters a bankruptcy action we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for noncollectibility is warranted we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis the allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2003 and 2002 was 479 million and 484 million respectively and our writeoff of uncollectible accounts was 155 million and 120 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

property and depreciation 

  

estimating the useful lives of property plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment and actual lives may differ from these estimates changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate property plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such longlived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines future sales volumes growth rates for selling prices and costs alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

  

the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge actual outcomes may differ from the estimates for example if our products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized then our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

we test the carrying amount of goodwill annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes growth rates of selling prices and costs changes in working capital investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate we also test the sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes selling prices and costs if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value a possible impairment would be indicated if a possible impairment is indicated we would estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment charge would be 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

recorded we also use judgment in assessing whether we need to test more frequently for impairment than annually factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions competition product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments we have completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and have determined that none of our 26 billion of goodwill is impaired 

  

we have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives we have other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately 267 million and a net carrying amount of about 192 million these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss would be indicated the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows we use judgment in assessing whether the carrying amount of our intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 

  

primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities 

  

the determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities “vies” under fin 46r requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie using a computer simulation model determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie requires the exercise of significant management judgment the resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each vie in accordance with their beneficial interests the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie under fin 46r 

  

deferred income taxes and potential assessments 

  

as of december 31 2003 the corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credits totaling 4680 million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of 2479 million thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 2201 million as of december 31 2002 the net deferred tax asset was 2426 million these income tax losses and credits are in nonus taxing jurisdictions and in certain states within the us in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets the corporation considers many factors including the specific taxing jurisdiction the carryforward period income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence the corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

as of december 31 2003 united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 37 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us in accordance with apb 23 accounting for income taxes special areas these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely however they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings we periodically determine whether our nonus subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate following this assessment we would provide deferred income taxes on any earnings that were determined to no longer be indefinitely invested 

  

in addition we have recorded a liability for potential income tax assessments although management believes this liability for potential exposure to be adequate the liability may be affected by new laws new 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

interpretations of existing laws and rulings by tax authorities accordingly actual payments may differ from estimates at which time our income tax expense would be adjusted the internal revenue service is currently examining our consolidated income tax returns for 1999 through 2001 the examination is expected to be completed by the end of 2004 

  

contingencies and legal matters 

  

litigation 

  

the following is a brief description of certain legal and administrative proceedings to which the corporation or its subsidiaries is a party or to which the corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ properties are subject in management’s opinion none of the legal and administrative proceedings described below individually or in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

as of december 31 2003 safeskin was a party to product liability lawsuits seeking monetary damages in most cases of an unspecified amount safeskin is typically one of several defendants who manufacture or sell natural rubber latex gloves these lawsuits allege injuries ranging from dermatitis to severe allergic reactions caused by the residual chemicals or latex proteins in gloves worn by health care workers and other individuals while performing their duties safeskin has referred the defense of these lawsuits to its insurance carriers and management believes its insurance coverage is adequate for these types of claims 

  

as of december 31 2003 the corporation along with many other nonaffiliated companies was a party to lawsuits with allegations of personal injury resulting from asbestos exposure on the defendants’ premises and allegations that the defendants manufactured sold distributed or installed products which cause asbestosrelated lung disease these general allegations are often made against the corporation without any apparent evidence or identification of a specific product or premises of the corporation the corporation has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of these asbestos cases all asbestos claims have been tendered to the corporation’s insurance carriers for defense and indemnity the financial statements reflect appropriate accruals for the corporation’s portion of the costs estimated to be incurred in connection with resolving these claims 

  

contingency 

  

one of the corporation’s north american tissue mills has an agreement to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next 15 years in the event that the mill was shut down the corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of its owner the local utility company the net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of december 31 2003 is estimated to be approximately 100 million management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote 

  

environmental matters 

  

the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or analogous state statutes at a number of waste disposal sites none of which individually or in the aggregate in management’s opinion is likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

new accounting standards 

  

in december 2003 fasb issued fin 46r fin 46r requires consolidation of entities in which the corporation is the primary beneficiary despite not having voting control likewise it does not permit 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

consolidation of entities in which the corporation has voting control but is not the primary beneficiary the corporation adopted fin 46r for its luxembourgbased financing subsidiary described in financing commentary and the financing entities described in variable interest entities  as permitted by fin 46r the corporation has deferred application of fin 46r to march 31 2004 for its real estate entities and the synthetic fuel partnership described above 

  

on december 8 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” became law among other things the act provides a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d the corporation could amend its retiree health care benefit plans to better align the plans with the new act in accordance with fasb staff position 1061 the corporation has elected to defer recognizing the effects of the act because authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy provided by the act is pending such guidance when issued by the fasb may require the corporation to change previously reported information consequently the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement cost presented in the financial statements and accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued sfas 132 revised 2003 employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  “sfas 132r” sfas 132r revises the disclosures for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the corporation adopted sfas 132r’s 2003 annual disclosure requirements sfas 132r will require certain additional disclosures in 2004 including disclosure of interim period information the corporation will adopt the additional disclosure requirements of sfas 132r in accordance with its prescribed effective dates 

  

business outlook 

  

the corporation’s priorities for 2004 are to deliver top and bottomline growth in line with the longterm global business plan objectives that were announced in july 2003 those targets are 3 to 5 percent topline growth and mid to high singledigit bottomline growth the corporation also intends to deliver the benefits from its new capital allocation process namely to reduce capital spending and to focus on improving working capital as a percent of net sales the expectation that net sales will grow 3 to 5 percent assumes that volume growth will be the key driver based on current exchange rates currency effects are expected to be somewhat positive but less than 1 percent for 2004 as a whole however the currency effect will be offset by lower pricing as the corporation is expecting continued intense competition net income growth is anticipated to be achieved with the improved net sales helping to drive earnings growth as well as a continued focus on sustainable cost reduction the corporation has set an aggressive target for 2004 to reduce costs by approximately 150 million these cost savings should more than offset anticipated inflationary cost increases in fiber energy and employee health care in 2004 along with a modest increase in pension expense in addition the corporation foresees improved results from kc de mexico in 2004 building on the strong sales volume momentum in that company’s consumer business in the second half of 2003 including the impact of a slightly higher effective tax rate the corporation anticipates that diluted earnings per share will be in a range of 355 to 365 for 2004 

  

the corporation expects that capital spending will be about 750 million in 2004 toward the low end of its longterm target of 5 to 6 percent of net sales the corporation believes that its cash flows will remain strong which will allow it to spend approximately 500 million to repurchase about 2 percent of its outstanding common stock depending on market conditions also the corporation’s solid cash flow has enabled it to raise its dividend by nearly 18 percent in 2004 marking the 32 nd consecutive annual increase in its dividend 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

the corporation expects that the synthetic fuel partnership transaction entered into in 2003 will result in expenses federal income tax benefits and additional net income annually through 2007 the corporation anticipates that the benefit in 2004 will be slightly higher than in 2003 while 2005 and 2006 will be similar to 2003 and 2007 is expected to be somewhat lower than 2003 however the benefits from this transaction in those subsequent years are expected to be partially offset by the expiration of benefits from other tax savings initiatives 

  

in january 2004 the corporation announced changes to reorganize its personal care and consumer tissue businesses into two separate north atlantic personal care and consumer tissue groups and to put its operations in developing and emerging markets into one group the corporation’s businesstobusiness segment will now include its north american pulp operations in addition the wet wipes business will be part of the personal care segment instead of the consumer tissue segment the corporation will continue to have three global businesses led by individuals who have the accountability and the authority to make global decisions this new structure is expected to help increase the corporation’s speed in translating consumer and customer insights into innovative products streamlining decision making and helping to deliver cost reductions on a sustainable basis 

  

on february 25 2004 the corporation announced that it was evaluating the possible taxfree spinoff of its neenah paper and technical paper businesses along with its pulp and timber assets in pictou nova scotia and terrace bay ontario the “pulp and paper operations” the transaction is subject to approval by the board of directors and if approved is expected to occur in the second half of 2004 

  

the following supplementary information presents the historical net sales of the corporation excluding the pulp and paper operations and the historical net sales on a standalone basis of the pulp and paper operations the combination of the net sales of the corporation excluding the pulp and paper operations and the net sales of the pulp and paper operations on a standalone basis will not equal the corporation’s consolidated net sales because intercompany transactions are eliminated in the preparation of the corporation’s consolidated financial statements the net sales of the pulp and paper operations may not be indicative of its net sales in the future or what they would have been if the pulp and paper operations had been a separate company during the periods presented 

  

the corporation’s historical net sales excluding the pulp and paper operations were 139511 million and 131499 million for 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

the historical net sales of the pulp and paper operations on a standalone basis were approximately 650 million and 640 million for 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

intercompany transfers of pulp from the pulp and paper operations to the corporation pulp sales by the pulp business and pulp purchases by the corporation are included in the corporation’s consolidated financial statements at cost if the spinoff of the pulp and paper operations occurs any pulp purchased by the corporation from the standalone pulp and paper operations will be based on market prices which could be more or less than historical costs 

  

information concerning forwardlooking statements 

  

certain matters discussed in this report concerning among other things the business outlook including new product introductions cost savings anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking statements and are based upon management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation’s results will be as estimated 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases in addition many factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices of the corporation’s raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation’s products and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business also could impact the realization of such estimates 

  

for a description of these and other factors that could cause the corporation’s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forwardlooking statements see item i of this annual report on form 10k entitled “factors that may affect future results”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

as a multinational enterprise the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks including operating and financing activities and where deemed appropriate the use of derivative instruments derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions the corporation’s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to the fair value of the agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 

  

in accordance with sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended the corporation records all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value changes in the fair value of derivatives are either recorded in income or other comprehensive income as appropriate the gain or loss on derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur the gain or loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is included in other comprehensive income in the period that changes in fair value occur and is reclassified to income in the same period that the hedged item affects income the gain or loss on derivatives that have not been designated as hedging instruments is included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur 

  

presented below is a description of our most significant risks foreign currency risk interest rate risk and commodity price risk together with a sensitivity analysis performed annually of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices these analyses reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a oneyear period 

  

foreign currency risk 

  

foreign currency risk is managed by the use of foreign currency forward option and swap contracts the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset in whole or in part losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure management of foreign currency transactional exposures was not changed during 2003 and management does not foresee or expect any significant change in such exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future 

  

foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we perform an annual test to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current yearend the effect is 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

calculated by multiplying each affiliate’s net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2003 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately 49 million these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31 2003 rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the translation of the balance sheets of our nonus operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently we perform an annual test to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our nonus operations into us dollars these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments “uta” within stockholders’ equity the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these nonus operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 

  

as of december 31 2003 a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders’ equity by approximately 285 million these hypothetical increases in uta are based on the difference between the december 31 2003 exchange rates and the assumed rates in the view of management the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation’s consolidated financial position 

  

interest rate risk 

  

interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixedrate debt composed of short and longterm instruments the objective is to maintain a costeffective mix that management deems appropriate at december 31 2003 the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 35 percent variablerate debt adjusted for the effect of variablerate assets and 65 percent fixedrate debt the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations did not change significantly during 2003 and management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 

  

we perform two separate tests to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations both tests are based on our consolidated debt levels at the time of the test the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on our fixedrate debt interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixedrate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments with respect to fixedrate debt outstanding at december 31 2003 a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixedrate debt by about 120 million the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variablerate debt with respect to commercial paper and other variablerate debt a 10 percent increase in interest rates would have had no material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the corporation is subject to commodity price risk the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp selling prices of tissue products are influenced in part by the market price for pulp which is determined 

  

part ii 

continued 

  

by industry supply and demand on a worldwide basis the corporation supplies approximately 40 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations 

  

management still intends to reduce its level of pulp integration when market conditions permit and such a reduction in pulp integration if accomplished could increase the corporation’s commodity price risk specifically increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks management does not believe that commodity price risk is material to the corporation’s business or its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in addition the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities primarily natural gas which are used in its manufacturing operations derivative instruments are used to hedge this risk when it is deemed prudent to do so by management

in the us typically have a term of 5 to 6 years and provide for wage and
fringe benefit increases during the term the agreements have staggered
termination dates

insurance the corporation maintains coverage consistent with industry practice
for most risks that are incident to its operations

factors that may affect future results

certain matters discussed in this form 10k or documents a portion of which are
incorporated herein by reference concerning among other things the business
outlook including new product introductions cost savings and acquisitions
anticipated financial and operating results strategies contingencies and
contemplated transactions of the corporation constitute forwardlooking
statements and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning
future events impacting the corporation there can be no assurance that these
events will occur or that the corporations results will be as estimated

the assumptions used as a basis for the forwardlooking statements include many
estimates that among other things depend on the achievement of future cost
savings and projected volume increases furthermore the corporation has assumed
that it will continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates in those
product markets where it intends to grow by acquisition in addition many
factors outside the control of the corporation including the prices of the
corporations raw materials potential competitive pressures on selling prices
or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporations products and
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as general economic
conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business also could
impact the realization of such estimates

the following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10k
or in other sec filings among others could cause the corporations future
results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking
statements made by or on behalf of the corporation

such factors are described in accordance with the provisions of the private
securities litigation reform act of 1995 which encourages companies to disclose
such factors

competitive environment the corporation experiences intense competition for
sales of its principal products in its major markets both domestically and
internationally the corporations products compete with widely advertised
wellknown branded products as well as private label products which are
typically sold at lower prices the corporation has several major competitors in
most of its markets some of which are larger and more diversified than the
corporation the principal methods and elements of competition include brand
recognition and loyalty product innovation quality and performance price and
marketing and distribution capabilities inherent risks in the corporations
competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer
acceptance the effects of recent consolidations of retailers and distribution
channels and competitive reaction aggressive competitive reaction may lead to
increased advertising and promotional spending by the corporation in order to
maintain market share increased competition with respect to pricing would
reduce revenue and could have an adverse impact on the corporations financial
results in addition the corporation relies on the development and introduction
of new or improved products as a means of achieving andor maintaining category
leadership in order to maintain its competitive position the corporation must
develop technology to support its products

cost savings strategy the corporations anticipated cost savings are expected
to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing
productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business
segments the corporations strategic investments in its information systems
should also allow further cost savings through streamlining of its back office
operations there can be no assurance that such cost savings will be achieved

raw materials cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber is
used extensively in the corporations tissue and paper products and is subject
to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the pulp
markets recycled fiber accounts for approximately 30 percent of the
corporations overall fiber requirements on a worldwide basis the
corporations internally manufactured pulp supplies approximately 40 percent of
its virgin fiber requirements

the corporation still intends to reduce its level of pulp integration when
market conditions permit to approximately 20 percent and such a reduction in
pulp integration if accomplished could increase the corporations commodity
price risk specifically increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the
corporations earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not
adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp
prices derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks

polymer resins principally polypropylene are used extensively in the
corporations products such as diapers training and youth pants and
incontinence care products polymer resins which are principally derived from
petroleum may be subject to price fluctuations the corporation purchases
polymer resins from a number of suppliers significant increases in resin prices
could adversely affect the corporations earnings if selling prices for its
finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the
increases in resin prices

energy costs the corporations manufacturing operations utilize electricity
natural gas and petroleumbased fuels to insure that it uses all forms of
energy costeffectively the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency
improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites and also provides expert
staff assistance to operating units in negotiating favorable utility and other
energy supply agreements the corporations contracts with energy suppliers vary
as to price payment terms quantities and duration kimberlyclarks energy
costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of
supplies of particular forms of energy energy prices and local and national
regulatory decisions there can be no assurance that the corporation will be
fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of
energy sources derivative instruments are used to hedge natural gas price risk
when management deems it prudent to do so

acquisition strategy the corporations anticipated financial results and
business outlook are in part dependent upon the availability of suitable
acquisition candidates the corporation could encounter significant challenges
in locating suitable acquisition candidates that are consistent with its
strategic objectives and will contribute to its longterm success furthermore
there can be no assurance that any such acquired business can or will be
successfully integrated with the corporations businesses in order to provide
anticipated synergies and earnings growth

volume forecasting the corporations anticipated financial results reflect
forecasts of future volume increases in the sales of its products challenges in
such forecasting include anticipating consumer preferences estimating sales of
new products estimating changes in population characteristics such as birth
rates and changes in per capita income anticipating changes in technology and
competitive responses and estimating the acceptance of the corporations
products in new markets as a result there can be no assurance that the
corporations volume increases will occur as estimated

foreign market risks because the corporation and its equity companies have
manufacturing facilities in 42 countries and their products are sold in more
than 150 countries the corporations results may be substantially affected by
foreign market risks the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and
political instability in developing countries the extremely competitive
situation in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging
economic environments in argentina brazil mexico venezuela and developing
countries in eastern europe asia and latin america may slow the corporations
sales growth and earnings potential in addition the corporation is subject to
the strengthening and weakening of various currencies against each other and
local currencies versus the us dollar transaction exposure arising from
transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currency is selectively
hedged through foreign currency forward and swap contracts see managements
discussion and analysis  risk sensitivity contained in the 2002 annual report
to stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference translation exposure
for the corporation with respect to foreign operations is generally not hedged
there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against
substantial foreign currency fluctuations

contingencies the costs and other effects of pending litigation and
administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with
certainty although management believes that no such proceedings will have a
material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the
outcome of such proceedings will be as expected see item 3 legal

cases filed in 1999 prior to the acquisition of safeskin by the corporation

laws and the other is a shareholder derivative action alleging breach of

with a stock repurchase program undertaken by safeskin in december 2002 a
settlement agreement was entered into pursuant to which all claims against
safeskin and the other defendants in these two cases are to be released and
dismissed with prejudice and without admission of liability or wrongdoing by any
party in exchange for 55 million most of which is covered by insurance the
corporation recorded a charge of 21 million in the fourth quarter of 2002

approval by the us district court for the southern district of california

time  period  after  closing  and  are limited to a specified dollar amount of
coverage    the  corporation  has established appropriate accrued liabilities
with  respect thereto and does not otherwise consider these obligations to be

provide for wage and fringe benefit increases during the term  the agreements
have  staggered  termination  dates

insurance    the  corporation  maintains  coverage  consistent  with industry
practice  for  most  risks  that  are  incident  to  its  operations


factors  that  may  affect  future  results

certain  matters  discussed in this form 10k or documents a portion of which
are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  concerning among other things the
business  outlook  anticipated  financial  and operating results strategies
contingencies  and  contemplated  transactions  of  the corporation constitute
forwardlooking  statements  and  are based upon managements expectations and
beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation  there can be no
assurance that  these  events  will  occur  or that the corporations results
will be as estimated

the  following  factors  as  well as factors described elsewhere in this form
10k  or  in  other  sec filings among others could cause the corporations
future  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in  any
forwardlooking  statements  made  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  corporation

such  factors  are  described in accordance with the provisions of the private
securities  litigation  reform  act  of  1995  which  encourages companies to
disclose  such  factors

competitive  environment  the corporation experiences intense competition for
sales  of  its  principal products in its major markets both domestically and
internationally    the corporations products compete with widely advertised
wellknown  branded  products  as  well as private label products which are
typically sold at lower prices  the corporation has several major competitors
in most of its markets some of which are larger and more diversified than the

recognition  and  loyalty product innovation quality and performance price
and  marketing  and  distribution  capabilities    inherent  risks  in  the
corporations

competitive  strategy  include  uncertainties  concerning  trade  and consumer
acceptance the effects of recent consolidations of retailers and distribution
channels  and competitive reaction  aggressive competitive reaction may lead
to  increased advertising and promotional spending by the corporation in order
to  maintain market share increased competition with respect to pricing would
reduce revenue and could have an adverse impact on the corporations financial
results    in  addition  the  corporation  relies  on  the  development  and
introduction  of  new  or  improved  products  as  a means of achieving andor
maintaining  category  leadership    in  order  to  maintain  its competitive
position  the  corporation  must  develop technology to support its products

cost  saving strategy  a significant portion of the corporations anticipated
cost  savings  are  expected  to result from operating efficiencies including
those  anticipated  to  be  derived  from  the  corporations  gotomarket
initiatives  that  are  intended  to drive costs out of its supply chain  the
corporations  information system upgrades are an integral part of that series
of  initiatives    there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such cost savings and
efficiencies  will  be  achieved

raw  materials  cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber
is  used  extensively  in  the  corporations tissue and paper products and is
subject  to  significant  price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the
pulp  markets    recycled  fiber accounts for approximately 25 percent of the
corporations  overall  fiber  requirements    on  a  worldwide  basis  the
corporation  has  reduced  its  internal  supply  of  pulp to approximately 40
percent  of  its  virgin  fiber  requirements

the  corporation  still  intends to reduce its level of pulp integration when
market conditions permit to approximately 20 percent and such a reduction in
pulp  integration if accomplished could increase the corporations commodity
price risk  specifically increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the
corporations  earnings  if  selling  prices for its finished products are not
adjusted  or  if  such  adjustments  significantly trail the increases in pulp
prices    derivative  instruments  have  not been used to manage these risks

polymer  resins  principally  polypropylene  are  used  extensively  in  the
corporations  products  such  as  diapers  training  and  youth  pants and
incontinence  care  products    polymer resins which are principally derived
from  petroleum  may  be  subject  to  price  fluctuations   the corporation
purchases polymer resins from a number of suppliers  significant increases in
resin  prices  could  adversely  affect  the corporations earnings if selling
prices  for  its  finished  products  are  not  adjusted  or  if  adjustments
significantly  trail  the  increases  in  resin  prices

energy costs  the corporations manufacturing operations utilize electricity
natural  gas  and  petroleumbased fuels  to insure that it uses all forms of
energy  costeffectively  the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency
improvement  programs  at  all  of  its  manufacturing sites and also provides
expert  staff  assistance  to operating units in negotiating favorable utility
and  other  energy supply agreements  the corporations contracts with energy
suppliers  vary  as  to  price  payment  terms quantities  and  duration
kimberlyclarks energy costs are also affected by various  market  factors
including  the  availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy
prices and local and national regulatory decisions  there can be no assurance
that  the  corporation  will be fully protected against substantial changes in
the  price or availability of energy sources  derivative instruments are used
to  hedge  natural  gas  price risk when management deems it prudent to do so

acquisition  strategy    the  corporations anticipated financial results and
business  outlook  are  dependent  in  part  upon the availability of suitable
acquisition  candidates    the  corporation  could  encounter  significant
challenges  in  locating  suitable  acquisition candidates that are consistent
with  its  strategic  objectives and will contribute to its longterm success
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any such acquired business can or
will  be successfully integrated with the corporations businesses in order to
provide  anticipated  synergies  and  earnings  growth

volume  forecasting   the corporations anticipated financial results reflect
forecasts of future volume increases in the sales of its products  challenges
in  such  forecasting  include  anticipating  consumer preferences estimating
sales  of new products estimating changes in population characteristics such
as  birth  rates  and  changes  in per capita income anticipating changes in
technology  and estimating the acceptance of the corporations products in new
markets  as a result there can be no assurance that the corporations volume
increases  will  occur  as  estimated

foreign  market  risks  because the corporation and its equity companies have
manufacturing  facilities  in 42 countries and their products are sold in more
than 150 countries the corporations results may be substantially affected by
foreign  market  risks   the corporation is subject to the impact of economic
and  political instability in developing countries  the extremely competitive
situation  in  european  personal care and tissue markets and the challenging
economic environments in argentina brazil mexico and developing countries in
eastern  europe  asia  and  latin  america  may slow the corporations sales
growth and earnings potential  in addition the corporation is subject to the
strengthening and weakening of various currencies against each other and local
currencies  versus  the  us  dollar    transaction  exposure  arising from
transactions and commitments denominated in nonlocal currency is selectively
hedged  through  foreign  currency  forward swap and option contracts  see
managements  discussion  and  analysis  risk sensitivity contained in the
2001 annual report to stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference
translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations is
generally  not hedged  there can be no assurance that the corporation will be
fully  protected  against  substantial  foreign  currency  fluctuations

contingencies    the  costs  and  other  effects  of  pending  litigation and
administrative  actions  against  the  corporation  cannot  be determined with
certainty   although management believes that no such proceedings will have a
material adverse effect on the corporation there can be no assurance that the
outcome  of  such  proceedings  will  be  as  expected    see  item 3 legal
proceedings

plaintiffs  seek  compensation  for  injuries  allegedly caused by exposure to
substances  allegedly  emitted  by  the defendants mills including two mills
formerly  owned  by  the  corporation  and  from  the  central maine disposal
landfill  in  fairfield  maine    the  corporation  is contesting the claims
asserted  by  the  plaintiffs

since  1998  the  corporation  has been involved in a series of complex legal
disputes  between  the  corporation and mobile energy services company llc
and  related  parties  mesc  these disputes arose from the closure of the
corporations  mobile  pulp  mill    mesc  owns  a  cogeneration complex that
provides  energy  services  to  the  corporations  mobile  mill

in 1998 the corporation decided to close its mobile pulp mill and gave notice
to  mesc of its intent to terminate a longterm energy services agreement  in
january  1999  mesc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and brought an
adversary  proceeding  in  the  united  states  bankruptcy  court  against the
corporation  claiming  unspecified  damages  arising from the mill closure and
termination  of  the  energy  services  agreement

in  march  2001  an  arbitration  ruling  was  issued    in that ruling the
arbitrator  rejected  mescs  claims  related to the pulp mill closure finding
that  the  corporation  had affected a proper pulp mill closure  however the
arbitrator  also ruled that the operation of certain assets by the corporation
after  the  pulp mill closure permitted mesc to reinstate the pulp mill energy
services  agreement  this reinstatement became subject to binding arbitration
brought by mesc in april 2001  a ruling issued in this arbitration on january
31  2002  resulted  in  the  corporation  recording  a  pretax  charge  of
approximately  27  million  in  its  2001  earnings

in  addition  mesc  submitted binding arbitration claims for reimbursement by
the  corporation  of  certain  capital  and  energy costs incurred by mesc  a
ruling  issued  in  this  arbitration  on  january  21  2002  resulted in the
corporation  recording  a  pretax  charge of approximately 17 million in its
2001  earnings

of the numerous allegations made against the corporation in the 1999 adversary
proceeding  only    fraudulent  transfer  claims  remain  pending  before the
bankruptcy  court    in  addition  mesc  subsequently filed three additional
adversary  proceedings and one arbitration proceeding against the corporation
the  corporation  continues  to  contest  vigorously  mescs  various  claims

companies  was  a party to approximately 105 lawsuits in california florida
georgia  illinois  louisiana  mississippi missouri pennsylvania and texas
state  courts  with  allegations  of  personal  injury resulting from asbestos

manufactured  sold  distributed  or  installed  products  which  cause
asbestosrelated  lung  disease  no specific product ever manufactured by the
corporation  or  its  subsidiaries  has  been  identified by the plaintiffs as
having  caused  or  contributed  to  any  asbestosrelated  lung  disease the
corporation  has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of
these  asbestos  cases  all  asbestos  cases  have  been  tendered  to  the
corporations  insurance  carriers  for  defense  and  indemnity

the  corporation  has  been  named  a  potentially responsible party under the
provisions  of  the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation
and  liability  act  or  analogous  state  statutes at  a  number  of  waste

factors  that  may  affect  future  results

certain  matters  discussed in this form 10k or documents a portion of which
are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  concerning among other things the
business  outlook  anticipated  financial  and operating results strategies
contingencies  and  contemplated  transactions  of  the corporation constitute
forward
looking  statements  and  are based upon managements expectations and beliefs
concerning future events impacting the corporation  there can be no assurance
that  these  events  will  occur  or that the corporations results will be as
estimated

the  following  factors  as  well as factors described elsewhere in this form
10k  or  in  other  sec filings among others could cause the corporations
future  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in  any
forwardlooking  statements  made  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  corporation

such  factors  are  described in accordance with the provisions of the private
securities  litigation  reform  act  of  1995  which  encourages companies to
disclose  such  factors

competitive  environment  the corporation experiences intense competition for
sales  of  its  principal products in its major markets both domestically and
internationally    the corporations products compete with widely advertised
wellknown  branded  products  as  well as private label products which are
typically sold at lower prices  the corporation has several major competitors
in most of its markets some of which are larger and more diversified than the
corporation   the principal methods and elements of competition include brand
recognition and loyalty product quality and performance price marketing and
distribution  capabilities    inherent risks in the corporations competitive
strategy  include  uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance the
effects  of  recent consolidations of retailers and distribution channels and
competitive  reaction   aggressive competitive reaction may lead to increased
advertising  and  promotional spending by the corporation in order to maintain
market  share  increased  competition  with  respect  to pricing would reduce
revenue  and  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on the corporations financial
results    in  addition  the  corporation  relies  on  the  development  and
introduction  of  new  or  improved  products  as  a means of achieving andor
maintaining  category  leadership    in  order  to  maintain  its competitive
position  the  corporation  must  develop technology to support its products

cost  saving strategy  a significant portion of the corporations anticipated
cost savings are expected to result from operating efficiencies  there can be
no  assurance  that  such  cost  savings  and  efficiencies  will be achieved

raw  materials  cellulose fiber in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber
is  used  extensively  in  the  corporations tissue and paper products and is
subject  to  significant  price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the
pulp  markets    recycled  fiber accounts for approximately 25 percent of the
corporations  overall  fiber  requirements    on  a  worldwide  basis  the
corporation  has  reduced  its  internal  supply  of  pulp to approximately 40
percent  of  its  virgin  fiber  requirements

the  corporation  still  intends to reduce its level of pulp integration when
market conditions permit to approximately 25 percent and such a reduction in
pulp  integration if accomplished could increase the corporations commodity
price risk  specifically increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the
corporations  earnings  if  selling  prices for its finished products are not
adjusted  or  if  such  adjustments  significantly trail the increases in pulp
prices    derivative  instruments  have  not been used to manage these risks

energy  costeffectively  the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency
improvement  programs  at  all  of  its  manufacturing sites and also provides
expert  staff  assistance  to operating units in negotiating favorable utility
and  other  energy supply agreements  the corporations contracts with energy
suppliers  vary  as  to  price  payment  terms quantities  and  duration
kimberlyclarks energy costs are also affected by various  market  factors
including  the  availability of supplies of particular forms of energy energy
prices and local and national regulatory decisions  there can be no assurance

the  price  or  availability  of energy sources especially in light of recent
instability  in  energy  markets    see  also  item  3 legal proceedings for
discussion  of  mobile  energy  services  company  llc

acquisition  strategy    the  corporations anticipated financial results and
business  outlook  are  dependent  in  part  upon the availability of suitable
acquisition  candidates    the  corporation  could  encounter  significant
challenges  in  locating  suitable  acquisition candidates that are consistent
with  its  strategic  objectives and will contribute to its longterm success
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any such acquired business can or
will  be successfully integrated with the corporations businesses in order to
provide  anticipated  synergies  and  earnings  growth

volume  forecasting   the corporations anticipated financial results reflect
forecasts of future volume increases in the sales of its products  challenges
in  such  forecasting  include  anticipating  consumer preferences estimating
sales  of new products estimating changes in population characteristics such
as  birth  rates  and  changes  in per capita income anticipating changes in
technology  and estimating the acceptance of the corporations products in new
markets  as a result there can be no assurance that the corporations volume
increases  will  occur  as  estimated

foreign  market  risks  because the corporation and its equity companies have
manufacturing  facilities  in 41 countries and their products are sold in more
than 150 countries the corporations results may be substantially affected by
foreign  market  risks   the corporation is subject to the impact of economic
and  political instability in developing countries  the extremely competitive
situation  in  european  personal care and tissue markets and the challenging
economic  environments  in  mexico and developing countries in eastern europe
asia  and  latin america may slow the corporations sales growth and earnings
potential    in addition the corporation is subject to the strengthening and
weakening of various currencies against each other and local currencies versus

commitments  denominated in nonlocal currency is selectively hedged through

the  corporation  will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency
fluctuations

contingencies    the  costs  and  other  effects  of  pending  litigation and
administrative  actions  against  the  corporation  cannot  be determined with
certainty   although management believes that no such proceedings will have a

item  3  legal  proceedings

the  following  is  a  brief  description  of certain legal and administrative
proceedings  to  which  the  corporation  or its subsidiaries is a party or to
which  the  corporations  or  its  subsidiaries  properties  are  subject

on  may  13  1997 the state of florida acting through its attorney general
filed  a  complaint  in the gainesville division of the united states district
court  for  the  northern  district  of florida alleging that manufacturers of
tissue  products  for awayfromhome use including the corporation and scott
agreed  to  fix  prices  by  coordinating  price  increases for such products
following  floridas complaint similar actions by the states of maryland new
york  and  west virginia as well as approximately 45 class action complaints
were  filed  in  various  federal  and  state courts around the united states

the  actions  by  the states of florida maryland new york and west virginia
the  private  plaintiffs  in  minnesota  and  the federal private class action
plaintiffs  were  dismissed  with  prejudice  pursuant  to  settlements  with
defendants    a  settlement  was  reached  in  the  california  class  action
litigation and was preliminarily approved by the judge in december 2000  with
respect  to  the  only remaining litigation filed in tennessee on behalf of a
purported class of indirect purchasers of commercial products the corporation
has answered the complaint and has denied the allegations contained therein as
well  as  any  liability

on  february  8  2000 the corporation completed the acquisition of safeskin
approximately 300 product liability lawsuits seeking monetary damages in most
cases  of  an  unspecified  amount  were  pending in federal and state courts
against  safeskin    safeskin  is  typically  one  of  several defendants who
manufacture  or  sell  natural  rubber  latex  gloves   these lawsuits allege
injuries  ranging  from  dermatitis to severe allergic reactions caused by the
residual chemicals or latex proteins in gloves worn by health care workers and
other  individuals  while  performing their duties  safeskin has referred the
defense  of  these  lawsuits  to  its  insurance  carriers

since  march  11  1999  numerous  lawsuits  collectively  the  securities
actions have been filed in the us district court for the southern district
of  california  against  safeskin  and  certain  of its officers and directors
alleging violations of sections 10b and 20a of the securities and exchange
act  of  1934  and rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder  the securities actions
were  brought  by plaintiffs in their individual capacities and on behalf of a
purported  class  of  persons  who  purchased  or  otherwise acquired safeskin
publicly  traded  securities  during  various  periods  occurring prior to the
corporations  acquisition  of  safeskin    the  suits allege that plaintiffs
purchased  safeskin  securities at prices artificially inflated by defendants
misrepresentations and omissions concerning safeskins financial condition and
prospects  and  seek  an unspecified amount of damages  defendants motion to
dismiss  was  denied  and  discovery  is  proceeding

in addition a shareholder derivative action has been filed against certain of
safeskins  directors  and  safeskin  as  a nominal defendant in the supreme
court  of the state of california san diego county the derivative action
the  derivative  action  alleges  breach of fiduciary duty waste of corporate
assets  and  gross  negligence  in connection with safeskins stock repurchase
program  and  seeks  an  unspecified  amount of damages  the court has stayed
discovery  in  the  derivative  action  so  that  it  can  be coordinated with
discovery in the securities actions  safeskin has referred the defense of the
derivative  action  and  the  securities  actions  to  its insurance carriers

item  3  legal  proceedings  continued

on  april  14  2000  a complaint was filed by anne meader and others against
kctc  and  others  in  the state of maine superior court  nineteen plaintiffs
seek  compensation  for  injuries  allegedly  caused by exposure to substances
emitted  by  the  defendants mills including two former kctc mills and from
the  central  maine  disposal  landfill  in  fairfield  maine

the  corporation  intends  to  contest the foregoing claims vigorously and in
managements opinion they are not individually or in the aggregate expected
to  have  a  material  adverse effect on the corporations business financial
condition  or  results  of  operations

in  connection  with  the  mobile  pulp  mill  closure  on  may  5 1998 the
corporation  gave notice to mobile energy services company llc mesc of
its  intent to terminate a longterm energy services contract  on january 14
1999 mesc and related parties the debtors filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection  and  instituted an action in the united states bankruptcy court in
mobile  alabama  against kctc claiming unspecified damages in connection with
the  pulp  mill  closure    the  debtors  as  debtorsinpossession  own  a
cogeneration  complex that provides energy services to kctcs mobile facility
the  complaint  alleges that i the sale of the cogeneration complex by kctc
to  mesc in december 1994 was a fraudulent transfer ii kctc cannot effect a
pulp  mill  closure  while  it  continues  to operate the wastewater treatment
facility  and  produce  pulp  at the mobile facility iii kimberlyclarks
announced  pulp  mill  closure  was  a  repudiation  of  the  site  operating
agreements  iv  kctc  breached the master operating agreement by failing to
give  mesc  reasonable assistance in developing new business opportunities for
the  energy  complex after kimberlyclark announced the pulp mill closure v
kctc  failed  to  allow  the  sale  of  the  mobile pulp mill and vii kcs
announcement  of  the pulp mill closure in may 1998 was a fraudulent transfer
the  complaint  does  not  specify  the  amount  of  damages  demanded

on  december  31  1999 a joint motion the motion was filed with the us
bankruptcy  court the court seeking approval of a settlement agreement
and  compromise of claims and pending litigation against kctc arising from the
closure  of  the  pulp  mill  and termination of the energy services contract
under  the  proposed  settlement agreement kctc agreed to pay mesc at closing
approximately  30 million subject to certain adjustments  the court granted
the  motion  on january 24 2000   closing of the settlement would be subject
to  among  other conditions the debtors filing a plan of reorganization from
bankruptcy  and  the  ultimate  approval  of  that  plan  by  the  court  the
approximate 30 million payment which will be accrued when the conditions for
settlement  are met is in addition to 243 million previously accrued by the
corporation    in  addition  the  proposed  settlement provides among other
things  an  agreement  by  mesc to provide energy to the corporations mobile
tissue  mill  at  market  rates

in august 2000 the debtors filed a plan of reorganization with the court that
would  implement the settlement agreement  during the fourth quarter of 2000
several  crucial  elements of the debtors plan became no longer viable  as a
result  the  debtors  have  sought  and  received  from  the  court  and  the
corporation  several  extensions  of  deadlines  contained  in  the settlement
agreement

because  of  uncertainty  involving  the  debtors  business  prospects  the
corporation  has developed contingency plans seeking to minimize disruption to
its  mobile operations in the event that mesc is unable or unwilling to supply
energy to the mobile tissue mill  in the absence of the settlement agreement
the litigation and arbitration proceedings between the corporation and debtors
could resume  the outcome of the mesc litigation arbitration and settlement
is not expected  to  have  a  material  adverse effect on the corporations
business financial  condition  or  results  of  operations
