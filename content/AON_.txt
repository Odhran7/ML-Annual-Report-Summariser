funds held on behalf of clients 

we typically hold funds on behalf of clients including premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit to and from insurers certain funds held on behalf of clients are invested in interestbearing premium trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect and remit cash the principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes although we may earn interest on these accounts

seasonality 

due to buying patterns and delivery of certain products and services in the markets we serve revenues recognized tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year

regulatory authorities in the us and most other countries in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individuals entities and related service providers to obtain a license from a government agency including but not limited to licenses to operate as insurance producers brokers agents and consultants reinsurance brokers or managing general agents 

certain jurisdictions issue licenses only to resident entities or individuals in such jurisdictions if the company has no licensed subsidiary we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process 

our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are enforced by the fca in the uk by federal and state agencies in the us and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business the licensing of agents the monitoring of trade practices policy form approval limits on commission rates and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements 

insurance authorities in the uk us and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

investment securities and futures licensing authorities also govern certain business activities for example in the us we use aon securities llc an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of aon and a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member of finra and securities investor protection corporation for investment banking capital advisory services and other brokerdealer activities similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the us

human capital management 

our culture 

our culture is driven by our values – committed as one firm to our purpose united through trust as one inclusive diverse team and passionate about making our colleagues and clients successful our colleagues are the cornerstone of aons success collaboration and innovation drive our culture bringing the best of aon to clients in a holistic and seamless manner our delivering aon united strategy defines how aon colleagues work together to deliver value to clients setting a new standard for client leadership delivering aon united is brought to life through our common client value creation model which scales strategies from across the firm to bring the best of aon to clients 

colleagues 

as of december 31 2021 we employed approximately 50000 employees and conducted our operations in more than 120 countries and territories our colleagues’ diverse talents expertise and insights contribute to the success of both our firm and our clients and we seek to attract grow and retain the best talent in the industry our inclusive people leadership strategy is a central part of our aon united blueprint and is a key enabler to realizing our aspirations and purpose as a firm at aon all colleagues are called upon to be leaders in embracing and modelling our aon united values and behaviors inclusive people leadership at aon ensures that all colleagues – at every stage of their career journey – are equipped and motivated to deliver on our purpose and able to achieve their full potential 

training and development 

we invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make aon an attractive employer colleagues are invited to complete a variety of curricula to meet their career stage goals and developmental needs we provide our colleagues what they need to learn grow and become the leaders our clients seek from selfguided aon university courses to advanced learning programs the curriculum is aligned to the aon united blueprint and inclusive people leader strategy while the covid19 pandemic changed how our colleagues work and collaborate it did not slow us down aon’s investment in technology and use of virtual based learning and development programs during the pandemic has allowed us to continue these efforts despite much of our workforce remaining virtual during 2021 

colleague engagement and retention 

providing an engaging and rewarding colleague experience is a top priority for our firm and understanding colleagues’ feedback helps us reach that goal we use a variety of channels to facilitate open ongoing and direct communication with colleagues these channels include open forums and town halls with executives surveys and engagement through our business resource groups business resource groups are our independent voluntary nonprofit associations that provide input take action and help identify opportunities for our firm to further its diversity and inclusion commitments 

in response to the challenging events of 2020 we updated our engagement survey process by offering more frequent pulse surveys to understand how colleagues are engaging with their teams the firm and clients this outreach effort allows us to gather insights more rapidly and take timely action to address feedback our current practice is to conduct pulse surveys with subsets of the overall colleague population approximately six to eight times per year on timely or targeted issues as well as an annual allcolleague engagement survey the pulse surveys for 2021 were focused on topics such as manager and leadership support especially in how we serve clients colleague wellbeing inclusion and diversity and performance  rewards aon’s workforce feedback provides management a better understanding of evolving colleague viewpoints and ensures we are taking appropriate steps to drive colleague engagement and retention for discussion of the risks related to the attraction and retention of senior management and other professional personnel see the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this report 

rewards 

in addition to an inspired purpose and culture we are proud to offer our colleagues a total rewards program that combines competitive pay incentive opportunities and benefits our compensation programs including salary recognition cash and equity incentives connect to our formal performance management and career development approach these programs serve to reward colleagues for their impact both in what they accomplish for clients colleagues and shareholders and how they achieve those results we maintain a global commitment to colleague wellbeing and play a key role in supporting colleagues across the physical emotional financial and social spectrum our comprehensive benefit programs are competitive for the markets in which we operate and aligned with our values and culture 

in recognition of our colleagues’ role in growing the firm we introduced the aon united growth ownership plan in 2021 through the plan all eligible colleagues that were active on september 24 2021 received a onetime stockbased award enabling aon colleagues to share in the future success of our aon united mission 

our compensation philosophy aligns with our aon united strategy and delivering longterm shareholder value creation our executive incentives are based on driving results delivery of strategic initiatives and leadership beginning in 2021 20 of the shortterm incentives for senior executives are based on quantifiable performance against firmwide inclusion and diversity initiatives 

inclusion and diversity 

we believe that diverse inclusive teams produce better insight better solutions and ultimately the best outcomes for clients and aon’s longterm success 

we are focused on being a firm that is representative of the communities in which we operate we achieve this by aligning id actions to the following pillars recruitment education promotion and representation we strongly believe that only when colleagues can be their authentic selves will they reach their full potential 

our commitment to id starts from the top with our board of directors including its id subcommittee our global inclusive leadership council is sponsored by our chief executive officer and chief people officer regional inclusive leadership councils and our executive leadership teams drive actions to increase the diversity of our teams and colleagueled business resource groups support execution and provide additional opportunities for colleagues to enhance our inclusive environment

our apprenticeship program 

apprenticeship programs help build a talent pipeline of highly skilled and diverse professionals while providing apprentices with advanced education and work experience by removing some of the traditional barriers to entrylevel employment aon can contribute to local workforce development and cultivate talent while improving retention rates in these entrylevel roles as a founding member of six apprentice networks within the us we partner with companies and organizations to assist them in building their own programs through sharing best practices and learnings across these networks we have over 100 organizations committed as of december 31 2021 

aons twoyear apprenticeship program which was implemented in the uk and us in 2012 and 2017 respectively serves as an alternate route into a permanent role that normally requires a specific degree or professional experience aon provides motivated highpotential individuals with the required training on the job and in the classroom professional skills development mentorship and experiential learning to bridge the gap over 440 aon apprentices have been hired since the inception of the program across the us and uk both programs are certified apprenticeship programs by the department of labor in the us and the department of education in the uk in 2021 we expanded our us program to include additional us cities outside of chicagos metropolitan area to the following six metropolitan areas hiring over 100 apprentices and partnering with seven additional community colleges houston minneapolis new york philadelphia san francisco and washington dc

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with our existing and potential businesses and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in the “business” section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report because our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere 

risks related to our business 

an overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business 

the results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns volatility or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets including as a result of endemics or pandemics climate change political unrest or otherwise may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our commercial risk solutions reinsurance solutions and wealth solutions lines the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenues and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients in addition certain discretionary services within our business such as human capital projectrelated work within commercial risk solutions and health solutions and transaction liability may see a decrease in activity if the overall level of economic activity results in a reduction to our clients’ discretionary spending insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business also error and omission claims against us which we refer to as eo claims may increase in economic downturns also adversely affecting our business 

we face significant competitive pressures from traditional and nontraditional competitors that could affect our business 

as a global professional services firm we compete with global national regional and local insurance companies that market and service their own products other financial services providers brokers and investment managers independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms we compete with respect to service delivery of insights product features price commission structure technology financial strength ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition our competitors may have better financial technical and marketing resources broader customer bases greater name recognition more comprehensive products stronger presence in certain geographies or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have 

in addition alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could affect our business and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop 

our competitors may be more successful in innovating and delivering services to meet new and existing client needs competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes innovate faster respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions or price their services more aggressively than we do they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for business more effectively than we do further new and non traditional competitors our clients’ increasing ability and determination to selfinsure and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our business this competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients elect to engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts if we fail to respond successfully to the to the evolving competition we face our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality advice and solutions if a client is not satisfied with our services it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability or lose the client relationship altogether moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance for example in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a 

client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums many of our clients are businesses that actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and existing and future employees which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us damage to our reputation including as a result of negative perceptions or publicity regarding environmental matters climate change workforce diversity pay equity harassment social justice cyber security or data privacy or our inability to meet commitments or client and stakeholder expectations with respect to such matters could affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders employees and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business financial condition and operating results 

revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 

• the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “selfinsure” the use of socalled “captive” insurers and the development of capital marketsbased solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity increase competition and put pressure on pricing 

• fluctuation in the need for or relevancy of insurance; 

• the level of compensation as a percentage of premium that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity; 

• the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and may not rise as much as commissionbased compensation; 

• competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers including online sales without the involvement of an insurance broker and 

• growing number of technologyenabled competitors offering new risktransfer solutions that eliminate the traditional brokerclient relationship in both commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

the profitability of our operations may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns inflation early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to changes in our business and the market adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the revenue generated from our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the 

prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments our ability to secure new business our ability to forecast demand for our services and consequently appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce employee attrition inflation including wage inflation and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors andor assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies; selection or removal of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select such as investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control including but not limited to uncertainty or volatility in financial markets due to economic political and regulatory conditions or pandemics plaintiffs have and may continue to file individual and class action lawsuits alleging investment consultants have charged excessive fees given improper advice due to conflicts of interest or recommended investments that underperformed other investments available at the time defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources if any lawsuit – against the company or any other investment consultant – results in a large adverse verdict the size of the verdict or resultant negative adverse publicity may prompt the filing of additional lawsuits furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions 

the anticipated benefits of the redomiciliation from the uk to ireland may not be realized 

in april 2020 we changed the jurisdiction of incorporation for our parent company from the uk to ireland by means of a scheme of arrangement under english law the “reorganization” at the time of the reorganization we expected and we continue to expect that the reorganization will among other things provide greater certainty around ongoing access to existing us treaties with other eu member countries from which we derive benefit however we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the reorganization which could have an adverse effect on our business 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the us these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows approximately 55 of our consolidated revenue is nonus attributed on the basis of where the services are performed and where products are sold and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a relative disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against certain adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and as a result changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results for example the strengthening of the value of the us dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to us dollar even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use were 836 million at december 31 2021 and are reported in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of the total balance 160 million was restricted to its use as of december 31 2021 funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 61 billion at december 31 2021 and are reported in fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2021 these longterm investments had a carrying value of 64 million adverse changes in interest rates performance and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results we may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and shortterm investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or fall below their current levels or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced as we have experienced in japan and certain jurisdictions in the eu on the other hand higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company in addition during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work 

our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in particular lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans in addition the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense as a result we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

our worldwide pension plans are significant and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market demographic and other factors these factors include equity and bond market returns fair value of pension assets the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes or developments and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year in addition contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us gaap 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2021 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 94 billion the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we also are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2021 we had two committed credit facilities outstanding each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities included customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business 

additionally we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital reduce our financial flexibility and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy our senior debt ratings at december 31 2021 were a with a stable outlook sp bbb with a stable outlook fitch and baa2 with a stable outlook moody’s our commercial paper ratings were a2 sp f2 fitch and p2 moody’s 

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities such changes could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies a change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that tax rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are and anticipate we will be subject to income taxes in ireland the uk the us and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation or regulations the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation our global mix of earnings the use of global funding structures the tax characteristics of our income the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments in addition we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among ireland the uk the us and other countries including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between and among such countries or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material 

the overall tax environment in the jurisdictions in which we are or may be subject to taxes is highly uncertain and increasingly complex countries around the world are considering changes in their tax laws and regulations in the us various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are under active consideration which could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition the oecd a global coalition of member countries proposed a plan to reform international taxation which includes the introduction of a global minimum tax there remains significant uncertainty as to if when and how the various oecd proposals will ultimately be enacted in the various countries in which aon is or may be subject to taxes including the eu member states and if enacted the extent of their impact some of the proposals if enacted could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are and anticipate we will be subject to tax audits conducted by ireland the uk the us and other tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other changes such as those in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements the tax laws and regulations in ireland the uk the us and the other tax jurisdictions in which the we operate are inherently complex and we will be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities which could result in administrative or judicial procedures actions or sanctions which could be material 

there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in tax laws and regulations including any changes in the interpretation of such tax authorities or from audits and other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of such actions could cause our global effective tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets 

and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those relating to revenue recognition pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables valuation of goodwill and intangibles contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments or changes in accounting principles or standards and other factors actual results could differ from these estimates or changes in assumptions estimates policies or developments in the business may change our initial estimates which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders’ equity and cash flows 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other longlived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other longlived assets future goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities as a holding company without significant operations of its own our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to eo claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we assist our clients with various matters including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters and providing actuarial investment consulting and asset management services eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or the failure to give errorfree consulting or investment advice it is not always possible to prevent and detect eo and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims additionally parts or all of an eo claim could fall within insurance deductibles selfinsured retentions or policy exclusions accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated 

statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others in the event of a default our potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification 

the ultimate outcome of claims lawsuits proceedings guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or subject us to legal and regulatory actions 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the irish companies act the us securities laws rules and regulations the rules and regulations promulgated by the fca and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection trade sanctions laws restrictions and export controls antimoney laundering wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we serve or enter the methods by which we sell our products and services the overall structure of our business units the type of services and prices we can charge for our services or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions proceedings or fines 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us and the bribery act of 2010 in the uk impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in several cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations or conflict between them also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity additionally our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services including through acquisitions we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include additional requirements respecting data privacy data security and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by  regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate 

governmental and public attention to climate change and environmental matters including new or enhanced reporting diligence or disclosure rules and regulations could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report these and other rapidly changing laws rules and regulations may increase the cost of our compliance and risk management and otherwise impact our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the shift toward a lowercarbon economy driven by changes in laws rules and regulations lowcarbon technology advancement consumer sentiment andor liability risks may negatively impact our business model andor the business models of our clients in addition as governments investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other esg topics governments and other stakeholders may impose new rules or expectations causing a shift in disclosure and other behaviors that may negatively impact our business 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance 

our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or general underwriting operations and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions and our failure to adhere to these rules and regulations can expose us to fines or other sanctions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client 

services provided in our health solutions and wealth solutions businesses are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients in particular our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the us insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans uncertainty regarding or any changes to state or federal law or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions in addition changes in laws government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans such as medical defined contribution plans such as 401k or defined benefit plans such as pension may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 

if we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations increased government involvement or enforcement actions which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations for instance increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities additionally we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest which exist or could exist any time we or any of our employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests this could occur for example when we are providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction we also provide services to advise and assist in satisfying all our clients’ needs from all our businesses creating a greater potential for conflicts with advisory services 

due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base we regularly address potential conflicts of interest including without limitation situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client if these are not adequately identified and managed this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests with consequential regulatory and reputational risks including litigation or enforcement actions that could adversely affect us and our operations identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses in addition we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest 

insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of insurance placements for clients or by fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers this revenue when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other nonmarket related services is commonly known as mdi mdi is another example of an area in which potential conflicts of interest may arise this revenue may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition conduct and antibribery laws 

and regulations mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing consulting services to carriers while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be fully effective 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates employees clients strategic partners and others as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property however the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further we operate in many jurisdictions and effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available or adequate in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services or employ our colleagues additionally our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

operational risks 

our results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the covid19 global pandemic 

the covid19 global pandemic and the emergence of covid19 variants has created significant public health concerns and significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region where we operate 

a number of evolving factors related to the global pandemic and the postpandemic recovery period may influence the duration nature and extent of the impact on our business and financial results such factors include worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates employment rates consumer confidence and spending gross domestic product property values and changes in client behavior and foreign exchange rates in each of the markets in which we operate business closures changes in laws regulations including those changes that may provide for extended premium payment terms and guidance court decisions and litigation trends a decline in business and the ability of counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all an increased number of eo claims in those areas impacted by the pandemic as well as an increase in the incidence or severity of eo claims against us and our market partners our ability to sell and provide our services including due to the impact of travel restrictions lockdowns quarantines social distancing and alternative work arrangements the health of and the effect of the pandemic on our employees political disruption potential effects on our internal controls and risk mitigation processes including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments for our employees and business partners resurgences of spread identification of new more contagious variants of the virus resulting “lockdowns” government restrictions mandates requirements or recommendations and uncertainties in vaccine adoption 

in addition the continuing covid19 pandemic may again create significant disruptions or volatility in the credit or financial markets or impact our credit ratings which could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all 

finally the impact of the covid19 pandemic may heighten other risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility 

we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency 

furthermore the uk formally withdrew from the eu commonly referred to as brexit the eu and uk ratified a trade cooperation agreement governing their future relationship in 2021 to address trade economic arrangements law enforcement judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution among other things because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and requires ongoing complex additional bilateral negotiations between the uk and the eu as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation significant political and economic uncertainty remains we have significant operations and a substantial workforce within the uk and we previously enjoyed certain benefits based on the uk’s membership in the eu and the lack of clarity around the future relationship between the uk and the eu creates uncertainty that may have a material impact on our business and operations we may also be required to incur additional expense as we adapt to and create the ability to operate within the new political and regulatory environment 

additionally any development that has the effect of devaluing the euro or british pound could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency us credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

our success depends on our ability to retain attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships the unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy additionally competition for experienced professional personnel is increasingly intense and we are constantly working to retain attract and develop these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected we may also become involved in disputes and litigation in connection with our efforts to retain and hire personnel which can be disruptive to our business while we have plans for key management succession and longterm compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively our business could be adversely affected 

we strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel  this includes our commitment to diversity and inclusion focus on colleague wellness and mental health and building a flexible work environment that meets colleague and client needs if we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment or adapting to colleague needs or expectations we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel which could have a negative impact on our business 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to regulatory legal economic and market risks associated with global operations and sourcing including 

• difficulties in staffing and managing our offices and overseeing joint venture operations and compliance in disparate jurisdictions including due to unexpected inflation including wage inflation or job turnover and the increased travel infrastructure and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations; 

• hyperinflation in certain countries; 

• conflicting regulations across the countries in which we do business; 

• imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by governments in certain countries; 

• longer payment cycles; 

• greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 

• insufficient demand for our services in certain jurisdictions; 

• our ability to execute effective and efficient crossborder sourcing of services on behalf of our clients; 

• the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the company; 

• disparate tax regimes; 

• restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and 

• trade barriers 

the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods tornadoes extreme weather or other climate events; pandemic health events and manmade disasters including acts of terrorism civil unrest violence military actions and cyberterrorism including but not limited to ransomware the continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger energy shortages public health issues or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations if access to underwriting markets for certain lines of coverage becomes unavailable or difficult due to the impact of climate change on the claims environment this may have a negative impact on our clients’ access to coverage which could in turn reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and negatively impact our business 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us climate change may increase the likelihood or severity of a natural or manmade disaster 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a security incident or attack a natural disaster climate event terrorist attack pandemic power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel and office facilities and the proper functioning of computer systems telecommunications and other related systems and operations in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges in particular areas of our operations we could potentially lose access to key executives personnel or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing support functions and administration that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers benefits administrators software and system vendors business process outsourcing providers health plan providers investment managers and providers of human resources among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions actions or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition we face risks as we transition from inhouse functions to third party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our business and reputation an 

interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures cybersecurity incidents including but not limited to ransomware capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are then remitted to the insureds consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients this function creates a risk of loss arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions errors relating to transaction processing or other cybersecurity events or security breaches we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives we face risks associated with among others the acquisition or disposition of businesses the integration and development of acquired businesses and the entry into new lines of business or products 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible transactions the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms secure regulatory approval of transactions where required complete transactions and in the case of acquisitions successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture if a proposed transaction is not consummated the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely impact employees clients and shareholders and the failure to consummate a proposed transaction could result in payment of termination fees and reimbursement of expenses reputational harm disputes and litigation and missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges will not be subject to postclosing liabilities obligations or restrictions will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets or will realize the intended benefits of the disposition 

we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiatives to generate organic revenue growth these new lines of business products and services present the company with additional risks particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business product or service integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture recruiting and retaining experienced professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants external factors such as compliance with new or revised regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business products or services failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the divested business 

on may 1 2017 the company completed the sale of the benefits administration and business process outsourcing business the “divested business to an entity controlled by affiliates of the blackstone group lp the “buyer” this transaction carries inherent risks including the risk that we will not earn the 500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction 

risks related to technology cybersecurity and data protection 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses security breaches and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees we are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including methods that take advantage of remote work scenarios due to covid19 because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventative measures or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack we regularly experience social engineering attempts attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems ransomware incidents data loss via malicious and nonmalicious methods and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access problems with the information technology systems of vendors including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties cyberattacks and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business additionally we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems including those of targets we acquire which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack these types of incidents affecting us our clients insurance carriers vendors or other thirdparties could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client or employee personal information or company data 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues additionally in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or harm to our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs fines loss of revenue and loss of clients the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

in many jurisdictions including in the eu and the us we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive additionally certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach these notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk in particular in 2021 there have been a number of new privacy laws around the globe including china brazil and significant privacy rulings in the eu relating to the “schrems ii” case which imposed significant changes to the way companies export personal data from the eu we have had to implement new requirements set out in these laws within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business this new guidance issued to firms by the european regulators has and will continue to require significant time to implement and may require significant effort to review and effect applicable changes to it systems and transfer methods noncompliance with new 

and existing laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith we expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt new privacy regulations and there to be amendments to existing regulations as governments continue to legislate in respect of personal data we have and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental entities or others or impair our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop implement update and enhance technologybased solutions to support our business operations or if we are not able to effectively drive value for our clients through innovation and technologybased solutions 

our success depends in part on our ability to enhance and implement the technology systems necessary to operate our businesses and to achieve intended efficiencies and improvements we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences the effort to gain technological expertise develop new technologies in our business and achieve internal efficiencies through technology require us to incur significant expenses 

we also make investments in technologybased solutions including data and analytics solutions for our clients if we cannot innovate as quickly as our competitors if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary data and analytics tools including repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process our competitors are developing competing data and analytics tools and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions innovations in software cloud computing data and analytics or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in the business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments 

risks related to being an irishincorporated company 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

in addition depending on the circumstances the acquisition ownership andor disposition of our ordinary shares may subject shareholders to different or additional tax consequences under irish law including but not limited to irish stamp duty dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax 

as an irish public limited company certain capital structure decisions regarding the company will require the approval of shareholders which may limit the company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure 

irish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares if authorized to do so by a company’s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders such authorization may 

be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution the company’s constitution authorizes our directors to allot shares up to the maximum of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from march 31 2020 this authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter under irish law an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of shares being sought or approved 

irish law also generally provides shareholders with statutory preemption rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for such statutory preemption rights to be disapplied in a company’s constitution or by a special resolution of shareholders such disapplication of preemption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution the company’s constitution disapplies statutory preemption rights up to the maximum of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from march 31 2020 this disapplication will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter under irish law a disapplication of statutory preemption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of unissued shares being sought or approved 

irish law requires us to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholder and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions 

under irish law we may only pay dividends and generally make share repurchases and redemptions from distributable profits distributable profits may be created through the earnings of the company or other methods including certain intragroup reorganizations involving the capitalization of the company’s undistributable profits and their subsequent reduction while it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable profits in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases there is no assurance that the company will maintain the necessary level of distributable profits to do so

termination of business combination agreement 

on march 9 2020 we and wtw entered into a business combination agreement with respect to a combination of the parties the “combination” the parties’ respective shareholders approved the combination on august 26 2020 

on june 16 2021 the doj filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against the company and wtw in the united states district court for the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the combination on july 26 2021 the company and wtw mutually agreed to terminate the business combination agreement the “termination agreement” pursuant to the termination agreement the business combination agreement was terminated and a termination fee of 1 billion the “termination fee” was paid to wtw following the termination the lawsuit by the doj was dismissed

covid19 pandemic 

the outbreak of the coronavirus which causes covid19 was declared by the world health organization to be a pandemic and has impacted almost all countries in varying degrees creating significant public health concerns and significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate the covid19 pandemic has resulted and may continue to result in significant economic disruption and volatility although in recent months progress has been made in the development and distribution of vaccines contributing to overall improved economic conditions globally despite recent developments as a result of the delta and omicron variants we continue to closely monitor the situation and its impacts on our business liquidity and capital planning initiatives we continue to be fully operational and to reoccupy certain offices in phases where deemed appropriate and in compliance with governmental restrictions considering the impact on health and safety of our colleagues their families and our clients and we have restricted or minimized access to offices where appropriate to support the health and safety of our colleagues we continue to deploy business continuity protocols to facilitate remote working capabilities to ensure the health and safety of our colleagues and to comply with public health and travel guidelines and restrictions 

as the situation continues to evolve the scale and duration of disruption cannot be predicted and it is not possible to quantify or estimate the full impact that covid19 will have on our business while we continue to focus on managing our cash flow to meet liquidity needs our results of operations particularly with respect to our more discretionary revenues may be adversely affected however for the year ended december 31 2021 the impacts of covid19 on our business results have lessened and we have seen overall strength across the firm we continue to monitor the situation closely

nongaap metrics 

in our discussion of consolidated results we sometimes refer to certain nongaap supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth decline adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation this nongaap supplemental information should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements 

organic revenue growth decline 

we use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth decline to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue growth decline is a nongaap measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates fiduciary investment income acquisitions divestitures transfers between revenue lines and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges this supplemental information related to organic revenue growth decline represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they may not make identical adjustments a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the reported total revenue is as follows in millions except percentages 





1 currency impact is determined by translating last year’s revenue at this year’s foreign exchange rates 

2 fiduciary investment income for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 8 million and 27 million respectively 

3 organic revenue growth decline includes the impact of intercompany activity changes in foreign exchange rates fiduciary investment income acquisitions divestitures transfers between revenue lines and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges 

adjusted operating margin 

we use adjusted operating margin as a nongaap measure of core operating performance of the company adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items as listed below because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance this supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported operating margins is as follows in millions except percentages 



1 as part of the terminated combination with wtw certain transaction costs have been incurred by us in 2021 these costs may include advisory legal accounting valuation and other professional or consulting fees related to the combination including planned divestitures that have been terminated as well as certain compensation expenses and expenses related to further steps on our aon united operating model as a result of the termination additionally this includes the 1 billion termination fee paid in connection with the termination of the combination 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above along with pension settlements and related income taxes because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings this supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows in millions except per share data and percentages

impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we conduct business in more than 120 countries foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year’s revenue expenses and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates 

currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of 017 on earnings per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2021 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of 003 on earnings per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2020 if 2019 results were translated at 2020 rates 

currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of 023 on adjusted earnings per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2021 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of 004 on adjusted earnings per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2020 if 2019 

results were translated at 2020 rates these translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in our financial statements 

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity our primary sources of liquidity in the nearterm include cash flows provided by operations and available cash reserves primary sources of liquidity in the longterm include cash flows provided by operations debt capacity available under our credit facilities and capital markets our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases pension obligations and shareholder dividends we believe that cash flows from operations available credit facilities available cash reserves and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including principal and interest payments on debt obligations capital expenditures pension contributions and anticipated working capital requirements in the next twelve months and over the longterm although there continues to be uncertainties around future economic conditions due to covid19 we have largely returned to normal levels of liquidity and will continue to monitor our needs as economic conditions change 

in the third quarter of 2021 the combination with wtw was terminated and on july 27 2021 we paid the termination fee of 1 billion refer to “termination of business combination agreement” within part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information the termination fee along with other payments made in the third and fourth quarters related to terminating the combination with wtw are reflected as an outflow to operating activities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap to prepare these financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 

in accordance with our policies we regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to those concerning revenue recognition pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes and base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we use to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services for arrangements where control is transferred over time an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation for arrangements that include variable consideration the company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained for arrangements that include multiple performance obligations the company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values 

costs incurred by the company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates considering anticipated renewals when applicable certain contract related costs including preplacement brokerage costs are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates which is generally less than one year 

commercial risk solutions includes retail brokerage specialty solutions global risk consulting and captives management and affinity programs revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy or policies or for a limited number of arrangements over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services 

to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services for arrangements recognized over time various output measures including units transferred and time elapsed are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period

health solutions includes consulting and brokerage human capital and voluntary benefits and enrollment solutions revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered for brokerage commissions revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy or policies or for a limited number of arrangements over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures including units delivered or time elapsed to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation for human capital revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of the services for arrangements recognized over time revenue is based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed revenue from voluntary benefits and enrollment solutions arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada which are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our us uk netherlands and canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted 

the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in other income we used a fullyield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the us uk netherlands and canada plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2021 our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or pbo to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our accumulated other comprehensive loss the number of years over which we are amortizing the loss and the estimated 2022 amortization of loss by country in millions except amortization period 



the us had no unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2021 the unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2021 was 40 million and 6 million for the uk and other plans respectively 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2021 the marketrelated value of assets was 22 billion we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2021 the fair value of plan assets was 24 billion our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of december 31 2021 



in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we surveyed multiple thirdparty financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the investment policy for uk and other nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and other nonus categories our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan target allocations are subject to change 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our pbo at december 31 2021 in millions 



1 increases to the pbo reflect increases to our pension obligations while decreases in the pbo are recoveries toward fullyfunded status a change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the pbo 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2022 pension expense in millions 



holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2022 pension expense in millions 



the net unfunded pension balance has continued to improve in 2021 reflecting continued progress in reducing the funded status at risk as a result the potential impact of a hypothetical adverse change in discount rates and return seeking asset exposures would have a less significant impact as compared to prior years a hypothetical discount rates decrease of 1 and return seeking assets decline of 10 would have resulted in expected balance sheet deterioration at 2021 of approximately 235 million as compared to approximately 410 million in 2019 an improvement of approximately 175 million this is largely due to greater amounts of liability matching assets and derisking actions 

estimated future contributions 

we estimate cash contributions of approximately 74 million to our pension plans in 2022 as compared with cash contributions of 87 million in 2021 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customerrelated and contractbased or technology and other 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a “component” a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component 

constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components are a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount then the goodwill impairment test becomes a quantitative analysis if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a dcf model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations  

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest for purposes of measuring sharebased compensation expense we consider whether an adjustment to the observable market price is necessary to reflect material nonpublic information that is known to us at the time the award is granted no adjustments were necessary for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 or 2019 we also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

rsus are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

psas are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation expense is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest plan is the lpp which has a threeyear performance period as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense the 2019 to 2021 performance period ended on december 31 2021 the 2018 to 2020 performance period ended on december 31 2020 and the 2017 to 2019 performance period ended on december 31 2019 the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2020 to 2022 and 2021 to 2023 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would not have increased our 2021 expense while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 76 million 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination 

we base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the indian rupee and the japanese yen we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars euro and japanese yen but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2021 we have hedged approximately 45 of our uk subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the us dollar euro and japanese yen transactions for the years ending december 31 2022 and 2023 we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward and option contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 48 million and 10 million at december 31 2022 and 2023 respectively 

the translated value of revenues and expenses from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if we were to translate prior year results at current year exchange rates diluted earnings per share would have a favorable 017 impact during the year ended december 31 2021 further adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure as defined and reconciled under the caption “review of consolidated results — adjusted diluted earnings per share” would have a favorable 023 impact during the year ended december 31 2021 if we were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the us and in continental europe a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 bps would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 64 million to each of 2022 and 2023 pretax income a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 bps would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 64 million to each of 2022 and 2023 pretax income 

we have longterm debt outstanding excluding the current portion with a fair market value of 92 billion and 88 billion as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively the fair value was greater than the carrying value by 09 billion at december 31 2021 and 14 billion greater than the carrying value at december 31 2020 a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 8 or an increase of 9 respectively at december 31 2021 

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

licensing and regulation 

our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate including us federal and state laws see the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

regulatory authorities in the countries and states in the us in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individual or company licenses to act as producers brokers agents thirdparty administrators managing general agents reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters under the laws of most countries and states regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting renewing and revoking producers’ brokers’ and agents’ licenses to transact business in the country or state the operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular country or state which may require among other things that a firm operates in the country or state through a local corporation in a few countries and states licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities in such cases our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the country or state 

our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are enforced by the financial conduct authority “fca” in the uk by federal and state agencies in the us and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business the licensing of agents the monitoring of trade practices policy form approval limits on commission rates and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements 

insurance authorities in the uk us and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

investment securities and futures licensing authorities also govern certain business activities for example in the us we use aon securities llc an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of aon and a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member of the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and securities investor protection corporation for capital management transaction and advisory services and other brokerdealer activities similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the us 

further pension and financial laws and regulations including oversight and supervision by the fca in the uk the sec in the us and regulators in other countries govern certain of the retirementrelated consulting services provided by aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates this includes aon subsidiaries that provide investment advisory services regulated by various us federal authorities including the sec and finra as well as authorities on the state level in addition other services provided by aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates such as trustee services and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services are subject in various jurisdictions to pension investment securities and insurance laws and regulations and supervision 

clientele 

our clients operate in many businesses and industries throughout the world no one client accounted for more than 2 of our consolidated total revenues in 2020 additionally we place insurance with many insurance carriers none of which individually accounted for more than 10 of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2020

pandemic response 

in 2020 we shifted the vast majority of our colleagues to remote work in response to the covid19 pandemic the historic steps we’ve taken to build our aon business services platform were instrumental in our response acting early we began offering tools and services for enabling remote work and avoiding disruption in client service while emphasizing our commitment to colleague health and wellbeing our programs and policies on flexible work leadership development learning telemedicine childcare sick leave social and emotional health rapidly evolved to meet the new normal and create a “new better” for our colleagues based on where they live and work

colleague engagement and retention 

providing an engaging and rewarding colleague experience is a top priority for our firm and understanding colleagues’ feedback helps us reach that goal we use a variety of channels to facilitate open ongoing and direct communication including open forums with executives pulse check surveys and engagement through our business resource groups which are our independent voluntary nonprofit associations that provide input take action and help identify opportunities for our firm to further its diversity equity and inclusion commitments in response to the challenging events of 2020 we updated our engagement survey process by offering more frequent pulse check surveys to understand how colleagues are engaging with their teams the firm and clients so we can gather insights more rapidly and take timely action to address feedback the pulse check surveys for 2020 have been focused on topics such as manager and leadership support especially in how we serve clients colleague wellbeing inclusion and diversity and the aon united blueprint this feedback provides management a better understanding of evolving colleague viewpoints and ensures we are taking appropriate steps to drive colleague engagement and retention for discussion of the risks related to the attraction and retention of senior management and other professional personnel see part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report 

rewards

our apprenticeship program 

apprenticeship programs help build a talent pipeline of highly skilled and diverse professionals while providing apprentices with advanced education and work experience by removing some of the traditional barriers to entrylevel employment aon can contribute to local workforce development and cultivate talent while improving retention rates in these entrylevel roles 

aons twoyear apprenticeship program which was implemented in the us and uk in 2017 and 2012 respectively serves as an alternate route into a permanent role that normally requires a specific degree or professional experience by providing motivated highpotential individuals with the required training on the job and in the classroom professional skills development mentorship and experiential learning to bridge the gap over 290 aon apprentices have been hired since the inception of the program across the us and uk both programs are certified apprenticeship programs by the department of labor in the us and the department of education in the uk in 2020 we announced our commitment to expand this program to include additional us cities outside of chicagos metropolitan area to the following six metropolitan areas hiring over 100 apprentices houston minneapolis new york philadelphia san francisco and washington dc

risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with our existing and potential businesses and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in the “business” section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report because our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually 

occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere 

risks related to our business 

an overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business 

the results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns volatility or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our commercial risk solutions reinsurance solutions and data and analytic service lines the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenues and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business also error and omission claims against us which we refer to as eo claims may increase in economic downturns also adversely affecting our business 

we face significant competitive pressures from traditional and nontraditional competitors that could affect our market share 

as a global professional services firm we compete with global national regional and local insurance companies that market and service their own products other financial services providers brokers and investment managers independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms we compete with respect to service delivery of insights product features price commission structure technology financial strength ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition our competitors may have better financial technical and marketing resources broader customer bases greater name recognition more comprehensive products stronger presence in certain geographies or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have 

in addition alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could affect our market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop 

our competitors may be more successful in innovating and delivering services to meet new and existing client needs competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes innovate faster respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions or price their services more aggressively than we do they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do further new and non traditional competitors our clients’ increasing ability and determination to selfinsure and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our market share this competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts if we fail to respond successfully to the to the evolving competition we face our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality advice and solutions if a client is not satisfied with our services it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability or lose the client relationship altogether moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance for example in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums many of our clients are businesses that actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and existing and future employees which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders employees and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business financial condition and operating results 

revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 

• the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their riskprotection needs including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “selfinsure” the use of socalled “captive” insurers and the development of capital marketsbased solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity increase competition and put pressure on pricing; 

• fluctuation in the need for insurance; 

• the level of compensation as a percentage of premium that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity; 

• the growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees which can negatively impact us as fees are not generally indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commissionbased compensation; and 

• competition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers including online sales without the involvement of an insurance broker 

• growing number of technologyenabled competitors offering new risktransfer solutions that eliminate the traditional brokerclient relationship in both commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

the profitability of our consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

our profitability with respect to consulting engagements is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to changes in our business and the market adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments our ability to secure new consulting engagements our ability to forecast demand for consulting services and consequently appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce employee attrition and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors andor assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies; selection or removal of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select such as investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control including but not limited to uncertainty or volatility in financial markets due to economic political and regulatory conditions or pandemics plaintiffs have and may continue to file individual and class action lawsuits alleging investment consultants have charged excessive fees given improper advice due to conflicts of interest or recommended investments that underperformed other investments available at the time defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources if any lawsuit – against the company or any other investment consultant – results in a large adverse verdict the size of the verdict or resultant negative adverse publicity may prompt the filing of additional lawsuits furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions 

the anticipated benefits of the redomiciliation from the uk to ireland may not be realized 

in april 2020 we changed the jurisdiction of incorporation for our parent company from the uk to ireland by means of a scheme of arrangement under english law the “reorganization” at the time of the reorganization we expected and we continue to expect that the reorganization will among other things provide greater certainty around ongoing access to existing us treaties with other eu member countries from which we derive benefit however we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the reorganization which could have an adverse effect on our business 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the us these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows approximately 55 of our consolidated revenue is nonus attributed on the basis of where the services are performed and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against certain adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and as a result changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results for example the strengthening of the value of the us dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to us dollar even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use were 1192 million at december 31 2020 and are reported in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of the total balance 102 million was restricted to its use as of december 31 2020 funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 57 billion at december 31 2020 and are reported in fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2020 these longterm investments had a carrying value of 74 million adverse changes in interest rates performance and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results we may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and shortterm investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or fall below their current levels or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced as we have experienced in japan and certain jurisdictions in the eu on the other hand higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company in addition during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work 

our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in particular lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans in addition the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense as a result we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

our worldwide pension plans are significant and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market demographic and other factors these factors include equity and bond market returns fair value of pension assets the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes or developments and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year in addition contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2020 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 77 billion the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we also are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2020 we had two committed credit facilities outstanding each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities included customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital reduce our financial flexibility and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy our senior debt ratings at december 31 2020 were a with a stable outlook standard  poor’s or “sp” bbb with a negative outlook fitch inc or “fitch” and baa2 with a stable outlook moody’s investor services or “moody’s” our commercial paper ratings were a2 sp f2 fitch and p2 moody’s 

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities such changes could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers a change in the agency’s view of us currently or as a combined company after the closing of the transaction with wtw or our industry or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies a change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that tax rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are and anticipate we will be subject to income taxes in ireland the uk the us and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation or regulations the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation our global mix of earnings the use of global funding structures the tax characteristics of our income the effect of 

complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments in addition we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among ireland the uk the us and other countries including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between and among such countries or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material 

we are and anticipate we will be subject to tax audits conducted by ireland the uk the us and other tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other changes such as those in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements the tax laws and regulations in ireland the uk the us and the other tax jurisdictions in which the we operate are inherently complex and we will be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities which could result in administrative or judicial procedures actions or sanctions which could be material 

there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in tax laws and regulations including any changes in the interpretation of such tax authorities or from audits and other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of such actions could cause our global effective tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

the global effective tax rate that will apply subsequent to brexit might become uncertain and may vary from expectations 

as further discussed below on january 31 2020 the uk withdrew as a member of the eu commonly referred to as brexit and the uk has since ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the eu which is being applied provisionally from january 1 2021 until it is also ratified by the european parliament and the council of the eu the changes which are ongoing in applicable law and regulatory oversight of our operations caused by brexit in the uk and the member states of the eu will impact how we conduct business in the uk within the eu and between the uk and the eu which may result in changes in the countries in which we derive a portion of our global earnings as a result our actual global effective tax rate may vary from expectations and that variance may be material as a result of brexit 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those relating to revenue recognition pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables valuation of goodwill and intangibles contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments or changes in accounting principles or standards and other factors actual results could differ from these estimates or changes in assumptions estimates policies or developments in the business may change our initial estimates which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders’ equity and cash flows 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other longlived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other longlived assets future goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities as a holding company without significant operations of its own our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying 

principal and interest on outstanding debt paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to eo claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we assist our clients with various matters including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters and providing actuarial investment consulting and asset management services eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or the failure to give errorfree consulting or investment advice it is not always possible to prevent and detect eo and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims additionally parts or all of an eo claim could fall within insurance deductibles selfinsured retentions or policy exclusions accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others in the event of a default our potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification 

the ultimate outcome of claims lawsuits proceedings guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or subject us to legal and regulatory actions 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the irish companies act the us securities laws rules and regulations the rules and regulations promulgated by the fca and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection trade sanctions laws restrictions and export controls antimoney laundering wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we serve or enter the methods by which we sell our products and services the overall structure of our business units the type of services and prices we can charge for our services or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions proceedings or fines 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us and the bribery act of 2010 in the uk impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in several cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations or conflict between them also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity additionally our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the 

type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services including through acquisitions we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include additional requirements respecting data privacy data security and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by  regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance 

our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or general underwriting operations and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client 

services provided in our health solutions and retirement solutions service lines are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients in particular our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the us insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans uncertainty regarding or any changes to state or federal law or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions in addition changes in laws government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans such as medical defined contribution plans such as 401k or defined benefit plans such as pension may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 

if we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations increased government involvement or enforcement actions which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations for instance increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities additionally we could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest which exist or could exist any time we or any of our employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests this could occur for example when we are providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction we also provide services to advise and assist in satisfying all our clients’ needs from all our businesses creating a greater potential for conflicts with advisory services 

due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base we regularly address potential conflicts of interest including without limitation situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict or are perceived to conflict with the interests of another client if these are not adequately identified and managed this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests with consequential regulatory and reputational risks including litigation or enforcement actions that could adversely affect us and our operations identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses in addition we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest 

insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of insurance placements for clients or by fees paid by clients intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers this revenue when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets as opposed to as corporate clients of the 

intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other nonmarket related services is commonly known as market derived income “mdi” mdi is another example of an area in which potential conflicts of interest may arise this revenue may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest antitrust unfair competition conduct and antibribery laws and regulations mdi takes a variety of forms including volume or profitbased contingent commissions facilities administration charges business development agreements and fees for providing consulting services to carriers while accepting mdi is a lawful and acceptable business practice we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be fully effective 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates employees clients strategic partners and others as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property however the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further we operate in many jurisdictions and effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available or adequate in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services or employ our colleagues additionally our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

operational risks 

our results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the covid19 global pandemic 

the covid19 global pandemic has created significant public health concerns and significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region where we operate 

a number of evolving factors related to the global pandemic and the postpandemic recovery period may influence the duration nature and extent of the impact on our business and financial results such factors include worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates employment rates consumer confidence and spending gross domestic product property values and changes in client behavior and foreign exchange rates in each of the markets in which we operate business closures changes in laws regulations including those changes that may provide for extended premium payment terms and guidance court decisions and litigation trends a decline in business and the ability of counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all an increased number of eo claims in those areas impacted by the pandemic as well as an increase in the incidence or severity of eo claims against us and our market partners our ability to sell and provide our services including due to the impact of travel restrictions lockdowns quarantines social distancing and alternative work arrangements the health of and the effect of the pandemic on our employees political disruption potential effects on our internal controls and risk mitigation processes including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments for our employees and business partners resurgences of spread identification of new more contagious variants of the virus resulting “lockdowns” government restrictions or recommendations and uncertainties in vaccine manufacturing accessibility and adoption 

in addition the continuing covid19 pandemic may again create significant disruptions in the credit or financial markets or impact our credit ratings which could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all 

finally the impact of the covid19 pandemic may heighten other risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency 

furthermore the uk formally withdrew from the eu commonly referred to as brexit and ratified a trade cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the eu the agreement which is being applied provisionally from january 1 2021 until it is ratified by the european parliament and the council of the eu addresses trade economic arrangements law 

enforcement judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution among other things because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the uk and the eu as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation significant political and economic uncertainty remains we have significant operations and a substantial workforce within the country and we enjoy certain benefits based on the uk’s membership in the eu and the lack of clarity around the future relationship between the uk and the eu creates uncertainty that may have a material impact on our business and operations we may also be required to incur additional expense as we adapt to and create the ability to operate within the new political and regulatory environment 

additionally any development that has the effect of devaluing the euro or british pound could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency us credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

our success depends on our ability to retain attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other professional personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships the unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy competition for experienced professional personnel is intense and we are constantly working to retain attract and develop these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected while we have plans for key management succession and longterm compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively our business could be adversely affected we also are committed to diversity and inclusion and strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel if we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel which could have a negative impact on our business 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to regulatory legal economic and market risks associated with operating in and sourcing from foreign countries including 

• difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices including due to unexpected wage inflation or job turnover and the increased travel infrastructure and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations; 

• hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; 

• conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business; 

• imposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by foreign governments; 

• longer payment cycles; 

• greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 

• insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions; 

• our ability to execute effective and efficient crossborder sourcing of services on behalf of our clients; 

• the reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the company; 

• disparate tax regimes; 

• restrictions on the import and export of technologies; and 

• trade barriers 

the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods tornadoes extreme weather or other climate events; pandemic health events and manmade disasters including acts of terrorism civil unrest violence military actions and cyberterrorism the continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger energy shortages public health issues or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these 

consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a security incident or attack a natural disaster climate event terrorist attack pandemic power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel and office facilities and the proper functioning of computer systems telecommunications and other related systems and operations in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges in particular areas of our operations we could potentially lose access to key executives personnel or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing support functions and administration that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers benefits administrators software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers and providers of human resources among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions actions or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition we face risks as we transition from inhouse functions to third party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our business and reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures cybersecurity incidents capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are then remitted to the insureds consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients this function creates a risk of loss arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions errors relating to transaction processing or other cybersecurity events or security breaches we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives we face risks associated with among others the acquisition or disposition of businesses the integration and development of acquired businesses and the entry into new lines of business or products 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible transactions the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms complete transactions and in the case of acquisitions successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture if a proposed transaction is not consummated the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration if we dispose of or otherwise exit 

certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets or will realized the intended benefits of the disposition 

we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiatives to generate organic revenue growth these new lines of business products and services present the company with additional risks particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business product or service integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture recruiting and retaining experienced professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants external factors such as compliance with new or revised regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business products or services failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the divested business 

on may 1 2017 the company completed the sale of the benefits administration and business process outsourcing business the “divested business to an entity controlled by affiliates of the blackstone group lp the “buyer” this transaction carries inherent risks including the risk that we will not earn the 500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction 

risks related to technology cybersecurity and data protection 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses security breaches and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees we are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack including methods that take advantage of remote work scenarios due to covid19 because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventative measures or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack we regularly experience social engineering attempts attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems data loss via malicious and nonmalicious methods and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access problems with the information technology systems of vendors including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties cyberattacks and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business additionally we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems including those of targets we acquire which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack these types of incidents affecting us or our thirdparty vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client or employee personal information or company data 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues additionally in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or harm to our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error 

employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs fines loss of revenue and loss of clients the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

in many jurisdictions including in the eu and the us we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive additionally certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach these notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk in particular in 2020 there have been a number of new privacy laws around the globe including brazil california south africa and dubai we have had to implement new requirements set out in these laws within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business additionally the us privacy shield was invalidated by the eu causing significant uncertainty for business transferring personal data from the eu to the us new guidance issued to firms will require time to implement and may require significant effort to review and effect applicable changes to it systems and transfer methods noncompliance with new and existing laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith we expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt new privacy regulations and there to be amendments to existing regulations as governments continue to legislate in respect of personal data we have and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental entities or others or impair our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement technologybased solutions to support our business operations or if we are not able to effectively drive value for our clients through innovation and technologybased solutions 

our success depends in part on our ability to enhance and implement the technology systems necessary to operate our businesses and to achieve intended efficiencies and improvements we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences the effort to gain technological expertise develop new technologies in our business and achieve internal efficiencies through technology require us to incur significant expenses 

we also make investments in technologybased solutions including data and analytics solutions for our clients if we cannot innovate as quickly as our competitors if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary data and analytics tools including repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process our competitors are developing competing data and analytics tools and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions innovations in software cloud computing data and analytics or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in the business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments 

risks related to the combination 

the combination is subject to customary closing conditions including conditions related to regulatory approvals and may not be completed on a timely basis or at all or may be completed on a basis that has a material impact on the value of the combined company 

the closing of the pending combination of the combination is subject to a number of customary conditions and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the combination will be satisfied or waived to the extent applicable the failure to satisfy the required conditions could delay the closing of the combination for a significant period of time or prevent the closing of the combination from occurring at all these closing conditions include among others the approval of the scheme by the irish high court and certain antitrust related clearances including under the hart–scott–rodino antitrust improvements act the “hsr act” the european commission merger regulation and the antitrust laws of the other required antitrust jurisdictions 

the governmental agencies from which the parties will seek certain approvals related to these conditions have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations as a condition to their approval of the combination agencies may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business after the closing of the combination such requirements limitations costs or restrictions could delay or 

prevent the closing of the combination or have a material adverse effect on the combined company’s business and results of operations following the closing of the combination 

in addition the closing conditions include other legal and regulatory conditions such as i the sanction by the irish high court of the scheme and the delivery of the court order to the irish registrar of companies ii the approval by the nyse of the listing of all of our class a ordinary shares to be issued in connection with the scheme and iii the absence of any law or order that restrains enjoins makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the closing of the combination 

the combination is also subject to other customary closing conditions including i the business combination agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms; ii the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties made in the business combination agreement subject to specified materiality standards; iii the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to each party since march 9 2020; and iv the performance and compliance by each party of all of its obligations and compliance with all of its covenants under the business combination agreement in all material respects there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the combination will be satisfied or waived or that the combination will be completed within the expected time frame or at all 

in addition if the combination is not completed by march 9 2021 or june 9 2021 or september 9 2021 if extended under the terms of the business combination agreement if applicable or such earlier date as may be specified by the irish takeover panel either we or wtw may choose not to proceed with the combination the parties can mutually decide to terminate the business combination agreement at any time 

failure to close the combination could negatively impact our share price and future business and financial results 

if the combination is not completed for any reason our ongoing business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the potential benefits of having closed the combination we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

• we will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the combination 

• if the business combination agreement is terminated under specified circumstances we may be obligated to reimburse certain combination expenses of wtw or if terminated under other circumstances related to a failure to obtain the required antitrust clearances pay to wtw a termination fee equal to 1 billion; 

• we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets including negative impacts on the market price of our securities; 

• the manner in which clients vendors business partners and other third parties perceive us may be negatively impacted which in turn could affect our ability to compete for new business or to obtain renewals in the marketplace; 

• matters relating to the combination including integration planning may require substantial commitments of time and resources by management which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us; 

• the business combination agreement restricts us without wtw’s consent and subject to certain exceptions from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the combination occurs or the business combination agreement terminates these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other business changes to our business that may arise prior to the closing of the combination or the termination of the business combination agreement; and 

• we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to close the combination or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the business combination agreement 

if the combination does not close these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our business financial results and share price 

while the combination is pending we are subject to business uncertainties related to our relationships with employees clients and suppliers which could adversely affect our business and operations these uncertainties could also adversely affect the combined company following the combination 

uncertainty about the effect of the combination on employees clients and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us and consequently on the combined company these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the closing of the combination and for a period of time thereafter and could cause clients suppliers and others who deal with us to seek to delay or defer business decisions to change or terminate existing business relationships with us or for potential clients to choose other partners instead of us or to take other actions as a result of the combination that could negatively impact the combined company’s andor our revenues earnings cash flows and the market price of our securities employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the combination because employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company if despite our retention efforts key employees 

depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company the combined company’s business could be harmed and its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination could be adversely affected further uncertainty around the timing of the closing may heighten risk of employee attrition 

if completed the combination may not achieve its intended results 

we entered into the business combination agreement with the expectation that the combination would result in various benefits including among other things synergies at the combined company a comprehensive and more innovative product portfolio diversified growth profile and broad geographic reach achieving the anticipated benefits of the combination is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether our and wtw’s businesses can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner failure to achieve a delay in achieving or an increase in the costs to achieve these anticipated benefits in whole or in part could result in increased costs or decreases in expected revenues and could adversely affect the combined company’s future business financial condition operating results and cash flows additionally if any governmental agencies in connection with the combination require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business after the closing of the combination such requirements or restrictions could reduce the anticipated benefits of the combination 

we and wtw may be unable to successfully integrate their operations failure to successfully integrate our and wtw’s businesses in the expected timeframe may adversely affect the future results of the combined company 

our and wtw’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination will depend to a large extent on the ability to integrate our and wtw’s business the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result significant management attention and resources will be devoted to integrating our and wtw’s business practices and operations the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full expected benefits a failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination could adversely affect the combined company’s results of operations 

in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships and diversion of management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others the diversion of management attention to integration matters; difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the businesses; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; unanticipated costs delays and other hardships to integration efforts including any such costs delays or hardships caused by pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease including covid19 and the resulting travel and operations restrictions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in retaining existing clients and obtaining new clients; and challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company in addition even if the operations of our and wtw’s businesses are integrated successfully the full benefits of the combination including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and wtw’s businesses all of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the combination and negatively impact the combined company’s results of operations 

we have incurred and will incur substantial combination fees and costs in connection with the combination 

we have incurred and expect to incur a number of nonrecurring substantial combinationrelated costs associated with the closing of the combination combining the operations of the two organizations and achieving desired synergies these fees and costs will be substantial and a portion of them will be incurred regardless of whether the combination closes nonrecurring combination costs include but are not limited to fees paid to legal financial and accounting advisors retention severance change in control and other integrationrelated costs filing fees and printing costs 

additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the closing and the integration of our and wtw’s businesses there can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the incremental combinationrelated costs over time thus any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term the long term or at all and these costs could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operation prior to the closing and of the combined company following the closing 

the global effective tax rate that will apply to the combined group subsequent to the combination is uncertain and may vary from expectations 

there can be no assurance that closing of the combination pursuant to the business combination agreement will allow the combined group to maintain any particular global effective corporate tax rate no assurances can be given as to what the 

combined group’s global effective tax rate will be after the closing of the combination because of among other things uncertainty regarding the jurisdictions in which the combined group will derive income and the amounts derived thereof uncertainty regarding the ability and the time necessary to integrate business operations and entities and uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which it will operate as a result the combined group’s actual global effective tax rate may vary from expectations following the combination and that variance may be material 

litigation filed against wtw andor aon could prevent or delay the completion of the transaction or result in the payment of damages following completion of the transaction 

wtw aon and members of the wtw board may in the future be parties among others to various claims and litigation related to the business combination agreement and the transaction the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner and could result in substantial costs to aon and wtw including but not limited to costs associated with the indemnification of their respective directors and officers 

one of the conditions to the closing of the transaction is that no order whether temporary or permanent has been issued promulgated made rendered or entered into by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction which restrains enjoins makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the transaction excluding certain laws and orders unrelated to the required antitrust clearances and the required regulatory clearances consequently if plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting wtw and aon from completing the transaction on the terms contemplated by the business combination agreement such an injunction may delay the completion of the transaction in the expected timeframe or may prevent the transaction from being completed altogether 

risks related to being an irishincorporated company 

we are incorporated in ireland and irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

in addition depending on the circumstances the acquisition ownership andor disposition of our ordinary shares may subject shareholders to different or additional tax consequences under irish law including but not limited to irish stamp duty dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax 

as an irish public limited company certain capital structure decisions regarding the company will require the approval of shareholders which may limit the company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure 

irish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares if authorized to do so by a company’s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders such authorization may be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution the company’s constitution authorizes our directors to allot shares up to the maximum of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from march 31 2020 this authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter under irish law an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of shares being sought or approved 

irish law also generally provides shareholders with statutory preemption rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for such statutory preemption rights to be disapplied in a company’s constitution or by a special resolution of shareholders such disapplication of preemption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a 

company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution the company’s constitution disapplies statutory preemption rights up to the maximum of the company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from march 31 2020 this disapplication will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter under irish law a disapplication of statutory preemption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of unissued shares being sought or approved 

irish law requires us to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholder and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions 

under irish law we may only pay dividends and generally make share repurchases and redemptions from distributable profits distributable profits may be created through the earnings of the company or other methods including certain intragroup reorganizations involving the capitalization of the company’s undistributable profits and their subsequent reduction while it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable profits in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases there is no assurance that the company will maintain the necessary level of distributable profits to do so

recent developments 

the outbreak of the coronavirus covid19 was declared by the world health organization to be a pandemic and has continued to spread across the globe impacting almost all countries in varying degrees creating significant public health concerns and significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate while countries are in various stages of business and travel restrictions to address the covid19 pandemic as well as related reopenings these policies have impacted and will continue to impact worldwide economic activity and may continue to adversely affect our business we continue to closely monitor the situation and our business liquidity and capital planning initiatives we continue to be fully operational and continue to reoccupy certain offices in phases where deemed appropriate and in compliance with governmental restrictions considering the impact on health and safety of our colleagues their families and our clients for other areas where restrictions remain in place or where we have started to see a resurgence of covid19 we are closely monitoring the situation and continuously reevaluating our plan to return to the workplace we continue to deploy business continuity protocols to facilitate remote working capabilities to ensure the health and safety of our colleagues and to comply with public health and travel guidelines and restrictions 

as the situation continues to evolve and the scale and duration of disruption cannot be predicted it is not possible to quantify or estimate the full impact that covid19 will have on our business we are focused on navigating these challenges and potential future impacts to our business presented by covid19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking proactive steps to enhance our ability to meet our shortterm liquidity needs and support a commitment to no layoffs of our colleagues due to covid19 such actions include but are not limited to issuing 1 billion of our new 10year senior unsecured notes on may 12 2020 and using the proceeds to repay shortterm debt and for other corporate purposes and reducing our discretionary spending including limiting discretionary spending on mergers and acquisitions we also temporarily suspended our share buyback program and temporarily reduced compensation for named executive officers 

directors and colleagues during the second quarter as a precautionary measure focusing on implementing cash and expense discipline measures after carefully monitoring the situation we determined it was appropriate based on macroeconomic conditions and business performance to resume share buyback during the third quarter in addition temporarily reduced salaries for nonexecutives were restored at the end of the second quarter and withheld salaries plus 5 of the withheld salary amounts were repaid in the third quarter temporarily reduced salaries for named executive officers and cash compensation reductions for nonexecutive directors were fully reinstated and the withheld amounts were paid in full during the fourth quarter 

while the ultimate public health and economic impact of the covid19 pandemic is highly uncertain we expect that our business operations and results of operations including our net revenues earnings and cash flows will be adversely impacted depending on the duration and severity of the downturn as well as governmental or other regulatory policies and actions that may impact our business or operations our revenues can be generalized into two categories core and more discretionary arrangements core revenues tend to be highlyrecurring and nondiscretionary where the services are typically regulated required or necessary costs of managing the risk of doing business as expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 our core revenues did not experience a significant decrease due to the impacts of covid19 however if the economic downturn becomes more severe we expect that certain services within our core business may be negatively impacted as well more discretionary revenues tend to include projectrelated services where as expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 we saw an impact from decreases in revenue due to the impacts of covid19 the impacts of the pandemic on our business operations and results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 are further described in the section entitled “review of consolidated results” and “liquidity and financial condition” contained in part ii item 7 of this report

nongaap metrics 

in our discussion of consolidated results we sometimes refer to certain nongaap supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth decline adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results this nongaap supplemental information should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements 

organic revenue growth decline 

we use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth decline to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue growth decline is a nongaap measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates fiduciary investment income acquisitions divestitures transfers between revenue lines and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges this supplemental information related to organic revenue growth decline represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they may not make identical adjustments a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the reported total revenue is as follows in millions except percentages 





1 currency impact is determined by translating prior periods revenue at this periods foreign exchange rates 

2 fiduciary investment income for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was 27 million 74 million and 53 million respectively 

3 organic revenue growth decline includes the impact of intercompany activity changes in foreign exchange rates fiduciary investment income acquisitions divestitures transfers between revenue lines and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges 

adjusted operating margin 

we use adjusted operating margin as a nongaap measure of core operating performance of the company adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items as listed below because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance this supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported operating margins is as follows in millions except percentages 



1 included in the twelve months ended december 30 2018 was a 176 million noncash impairment charge taken on certain assets and liabilities held for sale 

2 during the fourth quarter of 2019 we settled legacy litigation that had been reported in a prior year as an adjustment to gaap earnings in connection with the settlement we recorded a 13 million charge in 2019 which represents the difference between the amount accrued in the prior year and the final settlement amount of the legacy litigation 

3 certain transaction costs associated with the combination will be incurred prior to the expected completion of the combination in the first half of 2021 these costs may include advisory legal accounting valuation and other professional or consulting fees required to complete the combination 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above along with pension settlements and related income taxes because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings this supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows in millions except per share data and percentages 







1 adjusted other income expense excludes pension settlement charges of 37 million for the year ended 2018

free cash flow 

we use free cash flow defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations this supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of the consolidated financial statements the use of this nongaap measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows in millions 



impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between 

periods by translating the prior year’s revenue expenses and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a 003 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2020 currency fluctuations had a 019 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2019 when 2018 results were translated at 2019 rates currency fluctuations had a 008 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2018 when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a 004 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2020 currency fluctuations had a 023 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2019 when 2018 results were translated at 2019 rates currency fluctuations had a 009 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2018 when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates these translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under our credit facilities our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases pension obligations shareholder dividends and restructuring activities  we believe that cash flows from operations available credit facilities and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including principal and interest payments on debt obligations capital expenditures pension contributions and anticipated working capital requirements over the longterm 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have taken various proactive steps and continue to evaluate opportunities that will increase our liquidity and strengthen our financial position such actions include but are not limited to issuing 1 billion of 10year senior unsecured notes on may 12 2020 and using the proceeds to repay shortterm debt and for other corporate purposes and reducing our discretionary spending including limiting discretionary spending on mergers and acquisitions we also temporarily suspended our share buyback program and temporarily reduced compensation for named executive officers directors and colleagues during the second quarter as a precautionary measure to protect our liquidity focusing on implementing cash and expense discipline measures after carefully monitoring the situation we determined it was appropriate based on macroeconomic conditions and business performance to resume share buyback during the third quarter in addition temporarily reduced salaries for nonexecutives were restored at the end of the second quarter and withheld salaries plus 5 of the withheld salary amounts were repaid in the third quarter temporarily reduced salaries for named executive officers and cash compensation reductions for nonexecutive directors were fully reinstated and the withheld amounts were paid in full during the fourth quarter 

we expect to have the ability to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months and beyond through the use of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments funds available under our credit facilities and commercial paper programs and cash flows from operations shortterm investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash as deemed appropriate in the second quarter we issued 1 billion in 280 senior notes due may 2030 from which a portion of the proceeds were used to repay our 600 million 500 senior notes in june 2020 which were scheduled to mature in september 2020 additionally in the third quarter aon global holdings plc established the european commercial paper program for €625 million subsequently the previous european commercial paper program established by aon global limited for €525 million was withdrawn in the quarter increasing the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the european program by €100 million in february of 2021 we repaid the 400 million 280 senior notes that were due to mature in march 2021 which further reduced our debt obligations 

we believe our liquidity position at december 31 2020 remains strong as evidenced by strong cash flows in the quarter and significant cash cash equivalent and shortterm investment balances given the significant uncertainties of economic conditions due to covid19 we will continue to closely monitor and actively manage our liquidity as economic conditions change 

cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes as well as amounts restricted as to their use funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance 

premiums and claims in fiduciary assets in the consolidated statements of financial position with a corresponding amount in fiduciary liabilities 

in our capacity as an insurance broker or agent we collect premiums from insureds and after deducting our commission remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters we also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds which are then returned to the insureds unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity the levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums claims and refunds make payments to underwriters and insureds and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf and upon the impact of foreign currency movements fiduciary assets because of their nature are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated creditworthy financial institutions our fiduciary assets included cash and shortterm investments of 57 billion and 52 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and fiduciary receivables of 81 billion and 67 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively while we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes 

we maintain multicurrency cash pools with thirdparty banks in which various aon entities participate individual aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero at december 31 2020 nonus cash balances of one or more entities may have been negative however the overall balance was positive 

the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and fiduciary assets as of december 31 2020 in millions 



cash and cash equivalents increased 94 million in 2020 compared to 2019 a summary of our cash flows provided by and used for continuing operations from operating investing and financing activities is as follows in millions

other liquidity matters 

distributable profits 

the company is required under irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable profits are created through the earnings of the irish parent company and among other methods through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the high court of ireland distributable profits are not linked to a us gaap reported amount eg retained earnings following the ireland reorganization we must reestablish distributable profits of the parent entity and will regularly create distributable profits as required to meet our capital needs as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 associated with aon global limited we had distributable profits in excess of 02 billion and 324 billion respectively we believe that we have the ability to create sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future 

credit facilities 

we expect cash generated by operations for 2020 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations finance capital expenditures continue purchases of shares under the repurchase program and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed 

as of december 31 2020 we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding our 900 million multicurrency us credit facility expiring in february 2022 and our 750 million multicurrency us credit facility expiring in october 2023 effective february 27 2020 the 750 million multicurrency us credit facility was increased by 350 million from the original 400 million in aggregate these two facilities provide 165 billion in available credit

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap to prepare these financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 

in accordance with our policies we regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to those concerning revenue recognition pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes and base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we use to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services for arrangements where control is transferred over time an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation for arrangements that include variable consideration the company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained for arrangements that include multiple performance obligations the company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values 

costs incurred by the company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates considering anticipated renewals when applicable certain contract related costs including preplacement brokerage costs are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates which is generally less than one year 

commercial risk solutions includes retail brokerage cyber solutions global risk consulting and captives revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy or policies or for a limited number of arrangements over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services for arrangements recognized over time various output measures including units transferred and time elapsed are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada which are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our us uk netherlands and canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted 

the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in other income expense we used a fullyield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the us uk netherlands and canada plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2020 our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2021 amortization of loss by country in millions except amortization period 



the us had no unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2020 the unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2020 was 43 million and 7 million for the uk and other plans respectively 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2020 the marketrelated value of assets was 21 billion we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2020 the fair value of plan assets was 23 billion our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of december 31 2020 



in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we surveyed multiple thirdparty financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the investment policy for uk and other nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and other nonus categories our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan target allocations are subject to change 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point “bps” increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2020 in millions 



1 increases to the projected benefit obligation reflect increases to our pension obligations while decreases in the projected benefit obligation are recoveries toward fullyfunded status a change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the projected benefit obligation 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2021 pension expense in millions 



holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2021 pension expense in millions 



estimated future contributions 

we estimate cash contributions of approximately 122 million to our pension plans in 2021 as compared with cash contributions of 120 million in 2020 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customerrelated and contractbased or technology and other 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a “component” a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components are a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount then the goodwill impairment test becomes a quantitative analysis if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations  

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

restricted share units “rsus” are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

performance share awards “psas” are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation expense is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest plan is the leadership performance plan “lpp” which has a threeyear performance period as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense the 2018 to 2020 performance period ended on december 31 2020 the 2017 to 2019 performance period ended on december 31 2019 and the 2016 to 2018 performance period ended on december 31 2018 the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2019 to 2021 and 2020 to 2022 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2020 expense by approximately 72 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 72 million 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination 

we base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the indian rupee and the japanese yen we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars euro and japanese yen but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2020 we have hedged approximately 45 of our uk subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the us dollar euro and japanese yen transactions for the years ending december 31 2021 and 2022 we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward and option contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 28 million and 14 million at december 31 2021 and 2022 respectively 

the translated value of revenues and expenses from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if we were to translate prior year results at current year exchange rates diluted earnings per share would have an unfavorable 003 impact during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 further adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure as defined and reconciled under the caption “review of consolidated results — adjusted diluted earnings per share” would have an unfavorable 004 impact during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 if we were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the us and in continental europe a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 58 million to each of 2021 and 2022 pretax income a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 58 million to each of 2021 and 2022 pretax income 

we have longterm debt outstanding excluding the current portion with a fair market value of 88 billion and 74 billion as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively the fair value was greater than the carrying value by 1471 million at december 31 2020 and 815 million greater than the carrying value at december 31 2019 a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 7 or an increase of 8 respectively at december 31 2020 

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

seasonality 

due to buying patterns and delivery of certain products in the markets we serve revenues recognized tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year 

licensing and regulation 

our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate including united states “us” federal and state laws see the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

regulatory authorities in the countries and states in the us in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individual or company licenses to act as producers brokers agents thirdparty administrators managing general agents reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters under the laws of most countries and states regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting renewing and revoking producers’ brokers’ and agents’ licenses to transact business in the country or state the operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular country or state which may require among other things that a firm operates in the country or state through a local corporation in a few countries and states licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities in such cases our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the country or state 

our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are enforced by the financial conduct authority “fca” in the uk by federal and state agencies in the us and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business the licensing of agents the monitoring of trade practices policy form approval limits on commission rates and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements 

insurance authorities in the uk us and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

investment securities and futures licensing authorities also govern certain business activities for example in the us we use aon securities llc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member of the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and securities investor protection corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of aon for capital management transaction and advisory services and other brokerdealer activities similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the us 

further pension and financial laws and regulations including oversight and supervision by the fca in the uk the sec in the us and regulators in other countries govern certain of the retirementrelated consulting services provided by aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates this includes aon subsidiaries that provide investment advisory services regulated by various us federal authorities including the sec and finra as well as authorities on the state level in addition other services provided by aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates such as trustee services and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services are subject in various jurisdictions to pension investment securities and insurance laws and regulations and supervision

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with existing and potential business and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in the “business” section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere 

in addition you should consider the risks relating to the proposed reorganization which would result in an irish public limited company serving as the new publicly traded parent company of aon by means of a scheme of arrangement under english law we cannot assure you that the reorganization will be completed or if it is that we will realize the benefits we anticipate from the reorganization the risk factors relating to the reorganization are described under “risk factors” in our definitive proxy statement filed with the sec on december 20 2019 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

business risks 

an overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business 

the results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns volatility or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our commercial risk solutions reinsurance solutions and data and analytic service lines the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenues and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business also error and omission claims against us which we refer to as eo claims may increase in economic downturns also adversely affecting our business 

we face significant competitive pressures from traditional and nontraditional competitors that could affect our market share 

as a global professional services firm we compete with global national regional and local insurance companies that market and service their own products other financial services providers brokers and investment managers independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms we compete with respect to service product features price commission structure technology financial strength ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases greater name recognition more comprehensive products stronger presence in certain geographies or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have 

in addition alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could affect our market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes innovate faster respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions or price their services more aggressively than we do they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do further new and nontraditional competitors clients’ increasing ability and determination to selfinsure and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our market share this competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts if we fail to respond successfully to the to the evolving competition we face our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality advice and solutions focused on risk retirement and health if a client is not satisfied with our services it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums in addition claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to retain business or secure new business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it 

difficult for us to attract new clients and retain existing ones negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances including third parties the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and regulatory compliance damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business financial condition and operating results 

revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 

 the profitability of our consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

our profitability with respect to consulting engagements is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to changes in our business and the market adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments our ability to secure new consulting engagements our ability to forecast demand for consulting services and consequently appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce employee attrition and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors andor assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies selection or removal of investment managers the investment in different investment instruments and products and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select such as investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control including but not limited to uncertainty in financial markets due to economic political and regulatory conditions regardless of the cause 

clients including client employees participants or other thirdparty intended beneficiaries who experience losses or allege that we overcharge for such fiduciary services have in the past asserted claims against us and we anticipate future similar claims which could be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions additionally clients experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for our competitors 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the us these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows approximately 54 of our consolidated revenue is nonus attributed on the basis of where the services are performed and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and as a result changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results for example the strengthening of the value of the us dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to us dollar even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use were 928 million at december 31 2019 and are reported in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 52 billion at december 31 2019 and are reported in fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2019  these longterm investments had a carrying value of 53 million  adverse changes in interest rates performance and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results we may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and shortterm investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or fall below their current levels or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced as we have experienced in japan and certain jurisdictions in the eu on the other hand higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company in addition during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work 

our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in particular lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans in addition the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense as a result we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

our worldwide pension plans are significant and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market demographic and other factors these factors include equity and bond market returns fair value of pension assets the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes or developments and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes 

to our financial position and results of operations from year to year in addition contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2019  we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 73 billion  the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we also are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2019  we had two committed credit facilities outstanding each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities included customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital reduce our financial flexibility and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy our senior debt ratings at december 31 2019 were a with a stable outlook standard  poor’s or “sp” bbb with a stable outlook fitch inc or “fitch” and baa2 with a stable outlook moody’s investor services or “moody’s” our commercial paper ratings were a2 sp f2 fitch and p2 moody’s 

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities such changes could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies a change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position 

us federal income tax reform could create uncertainty and adversely affect our business and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 us federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” was signed into law significantly changing the us internal revenue code these changes include among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate subjecting certain future foreign subsidiary earnings whether or not distributed to us tax under a global intangible lowtaxed income provision imposing a new alternative “base erosion and antiabuse tax” on us corporations that limits deductions for certain deductible amounts payable to foreign affiliates imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest payable to related and unrelated lenders and further limiting deductible executive compensation the new provisions have been the subject of final regulations as well as proposed regulations and other guidance that if and when issued in final form could materially affect the application of the new statutory provisions in many cases the final and proposed regulations and other guidance will apply or are proposed to apply retroactively to the date of enactment of the tax reform act the government could also further modify the proposed rules when they are issued in final form we continue to analyze how the tax reform act and any regulations or other governmental action with respect thereto may impact our business and results of operations the changes effected pursuant to the tax reform act and the regulations or other governmental action thereunder may have an adverse or volatile effect on our tax rate in fiscal years 2020 and beyond thereby affecting our results of operations additionally the resulting uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and application of the new provisions and the risk that regulations or other governmental guidance including revisions to any such regulations or other governmental action 

that may change the application of the new statutory provisions may affect our assessment of the effect of the tax reform act on our business and operations as we continue to analyze it 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that tax rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are and anticipate we will be subject to income taxes in the uk us ireland and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation or regulations such as the enactment of the us tax reform act detailed above the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation our global mix of earnings the use of global funding structures the tax characteristics of our income the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments and the portion of the income of nonus subsidiaries that may be subject to us tax the portion of the income of nonuk subsidiaries that may be subject to uk tax or the portion of the income of nonirish subsidiaries that may be subject to irish tax whether or not distributed to the respective us uk or irish shareholders in addition we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among the uk the us ireland and other countries including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the uk and ireland and other jurisdictions including the us or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material 

we are and anticipate we will be subject to tax audits conducted by us uk ireland and other tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other changes such as those in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law audits and other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those relating to revenue recognition pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables valuation of goodwill and intangibles contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments or changes in accounting principles or standards and other factors actual results could differ from these estimates or changes in assumptions estimates policies or developments in the business may change our initial estimates which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders’ equity and cash flows 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other longlived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other longlived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other longlived assets future goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities as a holding company without significant operations of its own our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on 

outstanding debt paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to eo claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we assist our clients with various matters including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters and providing actuarial investment consulting and asset management services eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or the failure to give errorfree consulting or investment advice it is not always possible to prevent and detect eo and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims additionally parts or all of an eo claim could fall within insurance deductibles selfinsured retentions or policy exclusions accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others in the event of a default aon’s potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification 

the ultimate outcome of claims lawsuits proceedings guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or subject us to legal and regulatory actions 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the uk companies act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the fca the us securities laws rules and regulations and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection trade sanctions laws restrictions and export controls antimoney laundering wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we serve or enter the methods by which we sell our products and services the prices we can charge for our services or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions proceedings or fines 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in the us and the bribery act of 2010 in the uk 

impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in several cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity additionally our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services including through acquisitions we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include additional requirements respecting data privacy data security and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model or additional regulations promulgated by the fca in the uk or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past 

changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance for instance the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in 2018 created a range of new compliance obligations increased financial penalties for noncompliance and extended the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents wherever the company’s location we have incurred substantial operational costs to bring our practices into compliance with gdpr and as other jurisdictions enact their own privacy and data protection regulations we will incur further expenses to bring our practices in compliance with those regulations which may differ from gdpr 

our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or general underwriting operations and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client 

services provided in our health solutions and retirement solutions service lines are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients in particular our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the us insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans uncertainty regarding or any changes to state or federal law or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions in addition changes in laws government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans such as medical defined contribution plans such as 401k or defined benefit plans such as pension may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 

if we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations increased government involvement or enforcement actions which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations for instance increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing 

business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities additionally we operate in many different business lines which may occasionally intersect with each other such as placing both insurance and reinsurance or providing both investment consultancy and fiduciary management services if we fail to control possible resulting conflicts of interest we could be subject to civil litigation fines penalties and criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from participating in one or more lines of business as regulators and other government agencies continue to examine our operations there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future these and other initiatives from national state and local officials may subject us to judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause us to be required to restructure or divest operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues higher operational costs business disruption or loss thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition or operating results 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates employees clients strategic partners and others as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property however the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further we operate in many foreign jurisdictions and effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services additionally our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we have less flexibility as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

english law imposes additional restrictions on certain corporate actions for example english law provides that a board of directors may only allot securities with the prior authorization of shareholders with such authorization specifying a maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under it and lasting for a maximum period of five years each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2020 this authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting held while we remain a uk company 

english law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for the articles of association or shareholders in general meeting to exclude preemptive rights such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2020 this exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting held while we remain a uk company 

english law also requires us to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the uk parent company or other actions as of december 31 2019  we had distributable reserves in excess of 324 billion  while it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases there is no assurance that the parent company level will maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to do so 

english law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “offmarket purchases” without the prior approval of our shareholders such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years our shares are traded on the nyse which is not a recognized investment exchange in the uk consequently any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “offmarket purchase” the current authorization expires on june 22 2023 renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically 

the enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult 

because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in us courts than would have been the case for a us company in addition it may be more difficult or impossible to bring some types of claims against us in courts in england than it would be to bring similar claims against a us company in a us court 

it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us obtained in the us courts 

we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales therefore it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the us in order to enforce judgments of us courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 

there is doubt as to the enforceability in england and wales in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts of civil liabilities solely based on the us federal securities laws the english courts will however treat any amount payable by us under us judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the english courts to enforce this debt against us the following criteria must be satisfied in order for the english court to enforce the debt created by the us judgment 

 if an english court gives judgment for the sum payable under a us judgment the english judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose these methods generally permit the english court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement also note that in any enforcement proceedings the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in england unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the us proceedings 

operational risks 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate including the uk’s withdrawal from the eu could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency 

furthermore the uk’s withdrawal from the eu which took place on january 31 2020 “brexit” has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu the uk entered an 11month transition period until december 31 2020 giving the uk and the eu 11 months in which to negotiate and ratify the terms of what is often referred to as a “free trade deal” with formal trade deal negotiations expected to begin in late february there remains inevitable uncertainty about the scope 

of any such arrangement particularly in key areas such as the regulation of financial services tax immigration and employment laws our publicly traded parent is incorporated in the uk and we have significant operations and a substantial workforce within the country aon enjoys certain benefits based on the uk’s membership in the eu and the lack of clarity around the future relationship between the uk and the eu creates uncertainty that may have a material impact on our business and operations we may also be required to incur additional expense as we adapt to the new political and regulatory environment we have taken steps and enacted plans including the proposed reorganization to ensure that we are able to operate our business in the normal course following brexit however if one or more of such actions or plans is unsuccessful or ineffective or if we become noncompliant with any conditions attached to such plans or actions it may affect our business operations and financial condition additionally brexit has the potential to adversely affect global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally any development that has the effect of devaluing the euro or british pound could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency us credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

we may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives 

in 2017 we initiated a global restructuring plan the “restructuring plan” in connection with the sale of the divested business the restructuring plan was intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency insight and connectivity the restructuring plan and was completed on december 31 2019 and resulted in cumulative costs of approximately 1433 million over the threeyear period consisting of approximately 619 million in workforce reduction 119 million in technology rationalization costs 69 million in lease consolidation costs 53 million in noncash asset impairments and 573 million in other costs including certain separation costs associated with the sale of the divested business 

we estimate that our annualized savings from the restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately 580 million in 2020 actual total savings and timing may differ from our estimates and we cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings unrealized savings in connection with the restructuring plan could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other professional personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships the unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy competition for experienced professional personnel is intense and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected while we have plans for key management succession and longterm compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively our business could be adversely affected we also are committed to diversity and inclusion and strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel if we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel which could have a negative impact on our business 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to regulatory legal economic and market risks associated with operating in and sourcing from foreign countries including 



 the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods tornadoes extreme weather or other climate events pandemic health events and manmade disasters including acts of terrorism civil unrest violence military actions and cyberterrorism the continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger energy shortages public health issues or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a security incident or attack a natural disaster climate event terrorist attack pandemic power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel and office facilities and the proper functioning of computer systems telecommunications and other related systems and operations in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges in particular areas of our operations we could potentially lose access to key executives personnel or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses security breaches and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees we are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventative measures or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack we regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems data loss via malicious and nonmalicious methods and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access problems with the information technology systems of vendors including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties cyberattacks and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business additionally we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems including those of targets we acquire which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack these types of incidents affecting us or our thirdparty vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client or employee personal information or company data 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues additionally in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or harm to our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs fines loss of revenue and loss of clients the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

in many jurisdictions including in the eu and the us we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive additionally certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach these notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk in particular the eu’s gdpr which went into effect in may 2018 caused us to incur significant expenses in an effort to implement the applicable gdpr provisions within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business in addition noncompliance with gdpr could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith other jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted their own regulations governing personal data and information and we expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt regulations we have and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental entities or others or impair our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to gain internal efficiencies through the application of technology or effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through innovation and technologybased solutions conversely investments in internal systems or innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technologybased solutions that anticipate or keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis the effort to gain technological expertise develop new technologies in our business and achieve internal efficiencies through technology require us to incur significant expenses and attract talent with the necessary skills there is no assurance that our technological investments in internal systems will achieve the intended efficiencies and such unrealized savings or benefits could affect our results of operations additionally if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary databases repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process our competitors are developing competing databases and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions innovations in software cloud computing or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments 

we are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets nevertheless for those efforts to produce meaningful value we are reliant on a number of other factors 

some of which our outside of our control for example our health solutions revenue line has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the us manage their growing health care expenses in order for these exchanges to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing support functions and administration that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers benefits administrators software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers and providers of human resources among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions actions or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition we face risks as we transition from inhouse functions to thirdparty support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our business and reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures cybersecurity incidents capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are then remitted to the insureds consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients this function creates a risk of loss arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions errors relating to transaction processing or other cybersecurity events or security breaches we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives we face risks associated with among others the acquisition or disposition of businesses the integration and development of acquired businesses and the entry into new lines of business or products 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying analyzing and negotiating possible transactions the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms complete transactions and in the case of acquisitions successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture if a proposed transaction is not consummated the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets or will realized the intended benefits of the disposition 

we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiatives to generate organic revenue growth these new lines of business products and services present the company with additional risks particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed such risks include the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business product or service integrating the acquired business into 

our systems and culture recruiting and retaining experienced professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants external factors such as compliance with new or revised regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business products or services failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the divested business 

on may 1 2017 we sold the divested business to an entity controlled by affiliates of the blackstone group lp the “buyer” this transaction carries inherent risks including the risk that we will not earn the 500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction furthermore we have entered into ongoing commercial arrangements with the buyer if we do not realize the intended benefits of these arrangements it could affect our results of operations or adversely affect our relationship with clients partners colleagues and other third parties additionally if the divested business does not deliver the level of service to which our clients and partners are accustomed it could adversely affect our relationships with such third parties 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

transfers of the class a ordinary shares may be subject to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk which would increase the cost of dealing in the class a ordinary shares 

stamp duty reserve taxes “sdrt” are imposed in the uk on certain transfers of chargeable securities which include shares in companies incorporated in the uk at a rate of 05 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer certain transfers of shares to depositories or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 15 percent 

our class a ordinary shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of depository trust company “dtc” transfers of shares held in book entry form through dtc will not attract a charge to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk a transfer of the shares from within the dtc system out of dtc and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the dtc system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 05 percent of any consideration which is payable by the transferee of the shares any such duty must be paid and the relevant transfer document stamped by her majesty’s revenues and customs “hmrc” before the transfer can be registered in the share registers of aon if those shares are redeposited into dtc the redeposit will attract stamp duty or sdrt at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

we have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the dtc system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that sdrt may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository before the transfer can be registered in our share registers the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to sdrt which will be charged at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares

executive summary of 2019 financial results 

aon is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk retirement and health solutions underpinned by proprietary data and analytics management continues to lead its set of initiatives designed to strengthen aon and unite the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by proprietary data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight connectivity and efficiency 

financial results 

in the first quarter of 2019 aon adopted new accounting guidance related to the treatment of leases that was applied using the modified retrospective approach under this approach prior periods were not restated refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for further information surrounding the quantitative and qualitative impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance 

the following is a summary of our 2019 financial results from continuing operations 

 we focus on four key nongaap metrics that we communicate to shareholders organic revenue growth adjusted operating margins adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flows these nongaap metrics should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto the “consolidated financial statements” the following is our measure of performance against these four metrics from continuing operations for 2019  



 proposed reorganization 

in october 2019 we announced the proposed reorganization which would result in an irish public limited company serving as our new publicly traded parent company by means of a scheme of arrangement under english law the reorganization would effectively change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the publicly traded parent company of aon from the uk to ireland 

the reorganization requires shareholder approval which was obtained on february 4 2020 we are also required to make an application to the high court of justice of england and wales to seek approval of the reorganization this application is expected to be heard and we currently anticipate that the reorganization will be completed on march 31 2020 this expected date depends on a number of factors if this expected date is changed we will give adequate notice of such change by issuing an announcement that will be made available at our website 

upon completion of the reorganization each shareholder will own the same number of class a ordinary shares of the new irish parent company that such shareholder owned immediately prior to completion of the reorganization and each shareholder’s proportionate ownership and relative voting rights will remain unchanged we will continue to report earnings and other financial statements in accordance with sec regulations including us dollar denominated financial statements we expect that the shares of the new irish parent company will be listed on the nyse under the symbol “aon” the same symbol under which our class a ordinary shares are currently listed 

we believe the reorganization will have no material impact on the daytoday conduct of the various operating companies within aon the strategy of aon or the dividend policy of the new irish parent company the location of our future operations will depend on the needs of our business independent of legal domicile as per our practice prior to the reorganization

nongaap metrics 

in our discussion of consolidated results we sometimes refer to certain nongaap supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results this nongaap supplemental information should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements 

organic revenue growth 

we use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue growth is a nongaap measure that includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard changes in foreign exchange rates fiduciary investment income acquisitions divestitures transfers between revenue lines and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges this supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they may not make identical adjustments a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the reported total revenue is as follows in millions except percentages 







adjusted operating margin 

we use adjusted operating margin as a nongaap measure of core operating performance of the company adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items as listed below because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance this supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported operating margins is as follows in millions except percentages 



 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the items identified above along with pension settlements and related income taxes because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings this supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows in millions except per share data and percentages 







 free cash flow

impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

because we conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial 

results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year’s revenue expenses and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a 019 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2019  currency fluctuations had a 008 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2018  when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates currency fluctuations had a 012 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2017  when 2016 results were translated at 2017 rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a 023 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2019  currency fluctuations had a 009 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2018  when 2017 results were translated at 2018 rates currency fluctuations had a 008 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2017  when 2016 results were translated at 2017 rates these translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under our credit facilities our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments restructuring activities capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases pension obligations and shareholder dividends we believe that cash flows from operations available credit facilities and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including principal and interest payments on debt obligations capital expenditures pension contributions and anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes as well as amounts restricted as to their use funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums and claims in fiduciary assets in the consolidated statements of financial position with a corresponding amount in fiduciary liabilities 

in our capacity as an insurance broker or agent we collect premiums from insureds and after deducting our commission remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters we also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds which are then returned to the insureds unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity the levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums claims and refunds make payments to underwriters and insureds and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf and upon the impact of foreign currency movements fiduciary assets because of their nature are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated creditworthy financial institutions our fiduciary assets included cash and shortterm investments of  52 billion and  39 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively and fiduciary receivables of 67 billion and  63 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively while we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes 

we maintain multicurrency cash pools with thirdparty banks in which various aon entities participate individual aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero at december 31 2019  nonus cash balances of one or more entities were negative however the overall balance was positive

other liquidity matters 

distributable reserves 

as a company incorporated in england and wales we are required under uk law to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves are created through the earnings of the uk parent company and among other methods through a reduction in share capital approved by the high court of justice in england distributable reserves are not linked to a us gaap reported amount eg retained earnings as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had distributable reserves in excess of 324 billion and 22 billion  respectively on july 16 2019 we completed a reduction in share capital to create additional distributable reserves of 31 billion to support the payment of possible future dividends or future share repurchases if and to the extent declared by the directors in compliance with their duties under uk law we believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund shareholder dividends and make share repurchases for the foreseeable future additionally following the reorganization we would be required under irish law to have available “distributable profits” the equivalent to distributable reserves under uk law to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders 

credit facilities 

we expect cash generated by operations for 2019 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations finance capital expenditures continue purchases of shares under the repurchase program and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed 

as of december 31 2019  we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding our 900 million multicurrency us credit facility expiring in february 2022 and our 400 million multicurrency us credit facility expiring in october 2023 

each of these facilities includes customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda in each case tested quarterly at december 31 2019  we did not have borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended december 31 2019  

shelf registration statement 

on september 25 2018 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of among other securities debt securities preference shares class a ordinary shares and convertible securities our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand market conditions and other factors 

rating agency ratings 

the major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at february 14 2020 appear in the table below 



a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to debt capital reduce our financial flexibility or restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether andor impact future pension contribution requirements 

guarantees in connection with the sale of the divested business 

in connection with the sale of the divested business we guaranteed future operating lease commitments related to certain facilities assumed by the buyer we are obligated to perform under the guarantees if the divested business defaults on the leases at any time during the remainder of the lease agreements which expire on various dates through 2025 as of december 31 2019  the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the lease guarantee were 70 million  with an estimated fair value of 12 million  no cash payments were made in connection to the lease commitments during the year ended december 31 2019  

additionally we are subject to performance guarantee requirements under certain client arrangements that were assumed by the buyer should the divested business fail to perform as required by the terms of the arrangements we would be required to fulfill the remaining contract terms which expire on various dates through 2023 as of december 31 2019  the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the performance guarantees were 151 million  with an estimated fair value of 1 million  no cash payments were made in connection to the performance guarantees during the year ended december 31 2019  

letters of credit and other guarantees 

we have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit “loc” we had total locs outstanding of approximately 73 million at december 31 2019  compared to 83 million at december 31 2018  these locs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our us and canadian nonqualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program we also have obtained locs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries 

we have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies the maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately 110 million at december 31 2019  compared to  103 million at december 31 2018  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

apart from commitments guarantees and contingencies as disclosed herein and note 17 “claims lawsuits and other contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report the company had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity our cash flows from operations borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties see “information concerning forwardlooking statements” in part i item i of this report 

contractual obligations 

summarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2019  payments by year due are estimated as follows in millions 



pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the employee retirement income security act and other regulations as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed to with or required by the uk pension plan trustees nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments we may make additional discretionary contributions 

in 2019 our principal uk subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the uk plans to contribute £12 million 2 million at december 31 2019 exchange rates per annum to facilitate derisking the trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our uk subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined windingup deficit as of december 31 2019 the estimated windingup deficit was £64 million 83 million at december 31 2019 exchange rates the trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreedupon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the windingup deficit be paid 

purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered and the timing of the transactions most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts purchase obligations exclude 299 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the periods when potential cash settlements will be made 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap to prepare these financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 

in accordance with our policies we regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to those concerning revenue recognition restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes and base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we use to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services for arrangements where control is transferred over time an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation for arrangements that include variable consideration the company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained for arrangements that include multiple performance obligations the company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values 

costs incurred by the company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates considering anticipated renewals when applicable certain contract related costs including preplacement brokerage costs are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates which is generally less than one year 

commercial risk solutions includes retail brokerage cyber solutions global risk consulting and captives revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy or policies or for a limited number of arrangements over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services for arrangements recognized over time various output measures including units transferred and time elapsed are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period

restructuring 

workforce reduction costs 

the method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan which represents the majority of these costs or are considered onetime costs related to exit and disposal activities which are less frequent we account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts or we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula we recognize these costs when the likelihood of future settlement is probable and the amount of the related benefit is reasonably estimable or on a straightline basis over the remaining service period if applicable 

although less frequent than costs subject to our established severance policy when applicable we estimate our onetime workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated we recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated notify the employees who might be included in the termination and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period when employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period 

lease consolidation costs 

in the first quarter of 2019 aon adopted new accounting guidance related to the treatment of leases that was applied using the modified retrospective approach under this approach prior periods were not restated refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for further information surrounding the quantitative and qualitative impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance 

where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement we remove the associated rightofuse “rou” asset and the related lease liability including any additional termination penalties incurred that were not previously included within the liability to the extent that the associated rou assets and lease liabilities are removed a corresponding gain or loss is recorded 

for properties where we plan to permanently cease use of a space and have the intent and ability to sublease the property we will test the rou asset for impairment to determine if a loss has occurred the test for impairment will adjust the book value of the asset based on the net present value of the future cash flows expected from a sublease agreement using current market quotes for similar properties when we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee we may record an additional impairment to reflect actual outcomes 

for properties where we plan to permanently cease use of a space and have no intention of reoccupying or subleasing the property the amortization related to the rou asset will be accelerated and recognized on a straightline basis from the date that we commit to a plan to abandon the space through the date we permanently exit the property 

additionally a loss will also be recognized for lease related costs that are not reflected within the lease liability such as operating expenses taxes and insurance that we are obligated to pay to the landlord after we have permanently exited the property 

fair value concepts of onetime workforce reduction costs and lease losses 

accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability where material we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time so no discounting is necessary 

for the remaining lease term we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount if material the discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate which matches the lifetime of the liability significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded 

asset impairments 

asset impairments relate to fixed assets and are accounted for in the period when they become known furthermore we record impairments by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life 

other associated costs of exit and disposal activities 

we recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred including separation costs moving costs and consulting and legal fees 

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada which are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our us uk netherlands and canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted 

the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in other income expense we used a fullyield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the us uk netherlands and canada plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2019  our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2020 amortization of loss by country in millions except amortization period 



the unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2019 was 1 million  40 million  and 6 million for the us uk and other plans respectively 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2019  the marketrelated value of assets was 20 billion  we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2019  the fair value of plan assets was 21 billion  our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of december 31 2019  



in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we surveyed multiple thirdparty financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the investment policy for uk and other nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and other nonus categories our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan target allocations are subject to change 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point “bps” increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2019 in millions 



 holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2020 pension expense in millions 



holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2020 pension expense in millions 



estimated future contributions 

we estimate cash contributions of approximately  123 million to our pension plans in 2020 as compared with cash contributions of 135 million in 2019  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customerrelated and contractbased or technology and other 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others no events occurred during 2019 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a “component” a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components are a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount then the goodwill impairment test becomes a twostep analysis step 1 requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step 2 step 2 uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step 1 and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weightedaverage cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry based on tests performed in both 2019 and 2018  there was no indication of goodwill impairment and no further testing was required 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2019  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

restricted share units “rsus” are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

performance share awards “psas” are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation expense is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest plan is the leadership performance plan “lpp” which has a threeyear performance period as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense the 2017 to 2019 performance period ended on december 31 2019  the 2016 to 2018 performance period ended on december 31 2018  and the 2015 to 2017 performance period ended on december 31 2017  the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2018 to 2020 and 2019 to 2021  a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2019 expense by approximately 75 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 75 million 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination 

we base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the indian rupee and the japanese yen we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars euro and japanese yen but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2019  we have hedged approximately 45 of our uk subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the us dollar euro and japanese yen transactions for the years ending december 31 2020 and 2021  we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward and option contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 23 million and 6 million at december 31 2020 and 2021  respectively 

the translated value of revenues and expenses from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if we were to translate prior year results at current year exchange rates diluted earnings per share would have an unfavorable 019 impact during the twelve months ended december 31 2019  further adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure as defined and reconciled under the caption “review of consolidated results — adjusted diluted earnings per share” would have an unfavorable 023 impact during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 if we were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in north america continental europe and the asia pacific region a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 50 million to each of 2020 and 2021 pretax income a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 50 million to each of 2020 and 2021 pretax income 

we have longterm debt outstanding excluding the current portion with a fair market value of 74 billion and 62 billion as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  respectively the fair value was greater than the carrying value by 815 million at december 31 2019  and 166 million greater than the carrying value at december 31 2018  a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 7 or an increase of 8  respectively at december 31 2019  

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

licensing and regulation 

our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate including united states “us” federal and state laws see the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

regulatory authorities in the countries and states in the us in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individual or company licenses to act as producers brokers agents thirdparty administrators managing general agents reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters under the laws of most countries and states regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting renewing and revoking producers’ brokers’ and agents’ licenses to transact business in the country or state the operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular country or state which may require among other things that a firm operates in the country or state through a local corporation in a few countries and states licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities in such cases our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the country or state 

our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are enforced by the financial conduct authority “fca” in the united kingdom “uk” by federal and state agencies in the us and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business the licensing of agents the monitoring of trade practices policy form approval limits on commission rates and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements 

insurance authorities in the uk us and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

investment securities and futures licensing authorities also govern certain of our business activities for example in the us we use aon securities llc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member of the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and securities investor protection corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of aon for capital management transaction and advisory services and other brokerdealer activities similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the us 

further pension and financial laws and regulations including oversight and supervision by the fca in the uk the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the us and regulators in other countries govern certain of the retirementrelated consulting services provided by aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates this includes aon subsidiaries that provide investment advisory services regulated by various us federal authorities including the sec and finra as well as authorities on the state level in addition other services provided by aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates such as trustee services and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services are subject in various jurisdictions to pension investment securities and insurance laws and regulations and supervision 

clientele

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect material risks associated with existing and potential business and contain “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in the “business” section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur 

the following are material risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere 

business risks 

an overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business 

the results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns volatility or uncertainty in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our commercial risk solutions reinsurance solutions and data and analytic services revenue lines the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business also error and omission claims against us which we refer to as eo claims may increase in economic downturns also adversely affecting our business 

we face significant competitive pressures 

as a global professional services firm we compete with global national regional and local insurance companies that market and service their own products other financial services providers brokers and investment managers independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms we compete with respect to service product features price commission structure financial strength ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition 

our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases greater name recognition more comprehensive products stronger presence in certain geographies or more established relationships with their 

customers and suppliers than we have in addition new competitors alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster or price their services more aggressively they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do this competition is intensified by an industry trend where clients engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts if we fail to respond successfully to the competition we face our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected 

if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality advice and solutions focused on risk retirement and health if a client is not satisfied with our services it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums in addition claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to retain business or secure new business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and retain existing ones negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances including third parties the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and regulatory compliance damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely effecting our business financial condition and operating results 

revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 



 the profitability of our consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

our profitability with respect to consulting engagements is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to changes in our business adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments our ability to secure new consulting engagements our ability to forecast demand for consulting services and consequently appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce employee attrition and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors andor assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies selection or removal of investment managers the investment in different investment instruments and products and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select such as investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control including but not limited to uncertainty in financial markets due to economic political and regulatory conditions regardless of the cause clients experiencing losses or clients that allege that we overcharge for such fiduciary services have in the past asserted claims against us and we anticipate future similar claims which could be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions additionally clients experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for our competitors 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the us these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows approximately 57  of our consolidated revenue is nonus attributed on the basis of where the services are performed and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and as a result changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results for example the strengthening of the value of the us dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to us dollar even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use were 828 million  at december 31 2018  and are reported in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 39 billion  at december 31 2018  and are reported in fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2018  these longterm investments had a carrying value of 54 million  adverse changes in interest rates performance and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results we may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and shortterm investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced as we have experienced in japan and certain jurisdictions in the european union on the other hand higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company in addition during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work 

our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in particular lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans in addition the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense as a result we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

our worldwide pension plans are significant and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market demographic and other factors these factors include equity and bond market returns fair value of pension assets the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes or developments and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year in addition contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2018  we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 62 billion  the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we also are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2018  we had two committed credit facilities outstanding each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities included customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions or refinance any of our debt if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital reduce our financial flexibility and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy our senior debt ratings at december 31 2018  were a  with a stable outlook standard  poor’s or “sp” bbb  with a stable outlook fitch inc or “fitch” and baa2  with a stable outlook moody’s investor services or “moody’s” our commercial paper ratings were a2  sp f2  fitch and p2  moody’s 

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities such changes could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies a change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position 

us federal income tax reform could create uncertainty and adversely affect our business and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 us federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” was signed into law significantly changing the us internal revenue code these changes include among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate subjecting certain future foreign subsidiary earnings whether or not distributed to us tax under a global intangible lowtaxed income provision imposing a new alternative “base erosion and antiabuse tax” on us corporations that limits deductions for certain deductible amounts payable to foreign affiliates imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest payable to related and unrelated lenders further limiting deductible executive compensation and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries accumulations through the end of 2017 the new provisions have been the subject of proposed regulations and other guidance that if and when issued in final form could materially affect the application of the new statutory provisions in many cases the proposed regulations and other guidance proposed to apply retroactively to the date of enactment of the tax reform act the government could also further modify the rules when they are issued in final form we continue to analyze how the tax reform act and any regulations or other governmental action with respect thereto may impact our business and results of operations the changes effected pursuant to the tax reform act and the regulations or other governmental action thereunder may have an adverse or volatile effect on our tax rate in fiscal years 2019 and beyond thereby affecting our results of operations additionally the resulting uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and application of the new provisions and the risk that regulations or other governmental guidance including revisions to any such regulations or other governmental action that may change the application of the new statutory provisions may affect our assessment of the effect of the tax reform act on our business and operations as we continue to analyze it 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that tax rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the uk us and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation or regulations such as the enactment of the us tax reform act detailed above the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation our global mix of earnings the use of global funding structures the tax characteristics of our income the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments and the portion of the income of nonus subsidiaries that may be subject to us tax or the portion of the income of nonuk subsidiaries that may be subject to uk tax whether or not distributed to the respective us or uk shareholders in addition we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among the uk the us and other countries including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the uk and other jurisdictions including the us or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material 

we are subject to tax audits conducted by us uk and other tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other changes such as those in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law audits and other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those relating to revenue recognition restructuring pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables valuation of goodwill and intangibles contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments or changes in accounting principles or standards and other factors actual results could differ from these estimates or changes in assumptions estimates policies or developments in the business may change our initial estimates which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders’ equity and cash flows 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other longlived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other longlived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other longlied intangible assets future goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities as a holding company without significant operations of its own our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to eo claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the company as a whole 

we assist our clients with various matters including placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters and providing actuarial investment consulting and asset management services eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or the failure to give errorfree consulting or investment advice it is not always possible to prevent and detect eo and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims additionally parts or all of an eo claim could fall within insurance deductibles selfinsured retentions or policy exclusions accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the 

extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others in the event of a default aon’s potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification 

the ultimate outcome of claims lawsuits proceedings guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or increase competition 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the uk companies act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the fca the us securities laws rules and regulations and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection trade restriction and export controls antimoney laundering wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we serve or enter the methods by which we sell our products and services the prices we can charge for our services or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions proceedings or fines 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act “fatca” in the us and the bribery act of 2010 “uk bribery act” in the uk impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in several cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity additionally our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions could impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services or even cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions new regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include additional requirements respecting data privacy data security and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data additional changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate changes in accounting standards regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model or additional regulations promulgated by the fca in the uk or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past 

changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance for instance the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 created a range of new compliance obligations increased financial penalties for noncompliance and extended the scope of the european union data protection law to all companies processing data 

of european union residents wherever the company’s location we have incurred substantial operational costs to bring our practices into compliance with gdpr and where other jurisdictions enact privacy and data protection regulations we will incur further expenses to bring our practices in compliance with those regulations which may differ from gdpr 

our business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or general underwriting operations and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client 

services provided in our health solutions and retirement solutions revenue lines are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients in particular our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the us insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans uncertainty regarding or any changes to state or federal law or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies including the effects of health care reform by the us government could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions in addition changes in laws government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans such as medical defined contribution plans such as 401k or defined benefit plans such as pension may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 

if we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations increased government involvement or enforcement actions for instance increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities additionally we operate in many different business lines which may occasionally intersect with each other such as placing both insurance and reinsurance or providing both investment consultancy and fiduciary management services if we fail to control possible resulting conflicts of interest we could be subject to civil litigation fines penalties and criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from participating in one or more lines of business as regulators and other government agencies continue to examine our operations there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future these and other initiatives from national state and local officials may subject us to judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause us to be required to restructure or divest operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues higher operational costs business disruption or loss thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition or operating results 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates employees clients strategic partners and others however the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or 

require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we have less flexibility as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

english law imposes additional restrictions on certain corporate actions for example english law provides that a board of directors may only allot securities with the prior authorization of shareholders with such authorization specifying a maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under it and lasting for a maximum period of five years each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2019 this authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting 

english law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for the articles of association or shareholders in general meeting to exclude preemptive rights such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2019 this exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting 

english law also requires us to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the uk parent company or other actions as of december 31 2018 we had distributable reserves in excess of 22 billion  while it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases there is no assurance that the parent company level will maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to do so if at any time we do not have sufficient distributable reserves to declare and pay dividends we may undertake a reduction in capital of the company to reduce the amount of our share capital and nondistributable reserves and to create a corresponding increase in our distributable reserves out of which future distributions to shareholders could be made 

english law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “offmarket purchases” without the prior approval of our shareholders such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years our shares are traded on the nyse which is not a recognized investment exchange in the uk consequently any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “off market purchase” the current authorization expires on june 22 2023 renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically 

the enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult 

because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in us courts than would have been the case for a us company in addition it may be more difficult or impossible to bring some types of claims against us in courts in england than it would be to bring similar claims against a us company in a us court 

we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales therefore it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the us in order to enforce judgments of us courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 

there is doubt as to the enforceability in england and wales in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts of civil liabilities solely based on the us federal securities laws the english courts will however treat any amount payable by us under us judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the english courts to enforce this debt against us the following criteria must be satisfied in order for the english court to enforce the debt created by the us judgment 



 if an english court gives judgment for the sum payable under a us judgment the english judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose these methods generally permit the english court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement also note that in any enforcement proceedings the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in england unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the us proceedings 

operational risks 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate including the uk’s expected withdrawal from the european union could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency 

furthermore the uk’s withdrawal from the european union which is legally scheduled for march 29 2019 “brexit” has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the european union as the uk and european union continue to negotiate the terms of the uk’s withdrawal given the rejection of the proposed deal by the uk parliament on january 15 there remains inevitable uncertainty on topics such as financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements immigration laws and employment laws our publicly traded parent is incorporated in the uk and we have significant operations and a substantial workforce therein and therefore enjoy certain benefits based on the uk’s membership in the european union the lack of clarity about brexit and whether in the future uk laws and regulations are recognized in the eu creates uncertainty for us as the eventual outcome of negotiations may affect our business and operations we may be required to incur additional expense as we adapt to the political and regulatory environment postbrexit this may include legal entity structure changes adjusting the way we engage with some of our european and uk clients or choosing to relocate some of our staff we are currently examining the various impacts to our business and operating models in an effort to develop solutions to address any of the potential outcomes of the negotiations so our organization can continue to provide our clients with the services and expertise they require we also cannot be certain that regulators in other european union countries will grant us the permissions or licenses we seek to operate our business we have and will continue to invest significant time and resources as we navigate the effects of brexit and the uncertainty related thereto on our business and operations a less orderly brexit has the potential to adversely affect global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally any development that has the effect of devaluing the euro or british pound could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reducing the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency us credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

we may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives 

in 2017 we initiated a global restructuring plan the “restructuring plan” in connection with the sale of the divested business the restructuring plan is intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency insight and connectivity we expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations through the forth quarter of 2019 including an estimated 4800  to 5400  role eliminations the restructuring plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately 1225 million  through the end of the restructuring plan consisting of approximately 450 million  in 

employee termination costs 130 million  in it rationalization costs 65 million  in real estate realization costs 50 million  in asset impairment costs and 530 million  in other costs associated with the restructuring included in the estimated 1225 million  is 100 million of estimated noncash charges 

we estimate that our annualized savings from the restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately 500 million by the end of 2019 actual total costs savings and timing may vary from these estimates due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives we therefore cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings unanticipated costs or unrealized savings in connection with the restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other professional personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships the unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy competition for experienced professional personnel is intense and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected while we have plans for key management succession and longterm compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively our business could be adversely affected we also are committed to diversity and inclusion and strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel if we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel which could have a negative impact on our business 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to regulatory legal economic and market risks associated with operating in and sourcing from foreign countries including 

 the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods tornadoes extreme weather or other climate events pandemic health events and manmade disasters including acts of terrorism civil unrest violence military actions and cyberterrorism the continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger energy shortages public health issues or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as a security incident or attack a natural disaster climate event terrorist attack pandemic power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel and office facilities and the proper functioning of computer systems telecommunications and other related systems and operations in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges in particular areas of our operations we could potentially lose access to key executives personnel or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses security breaches and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees we are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through increasingly sophisticated methods of attack because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventative measures or respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack we regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems data loss via malicious and nonmalicious methods and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access problems with the information technology systems of vendors including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes cyberattacks and security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business additionally we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems including those of targets we acquire which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack these types of incidents affecting us or our thirdparty vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client or employee personal information or company data in addition we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense and divert resources to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues additionally in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or harm to our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs loss of revenue and loss of clients the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

in many jurisdictions including in the european union and the us we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive additionally certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach these notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk in particular the european union’s gdpr which went into effect in may 2018 caused us to incur significant expenses in an effort to implement the applicable gdpr provisions within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business in addition noncompliance with gdpr could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith we expect other jurisdictions in which we operate to adopt regulations governing personal data and information and we will have to continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with such future regulations our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impair our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools conversely investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary databases repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process our competitors are developing competing databases and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions innovations in software cloud computing or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments 

we are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets nevertheless for those efforts to produce meaningful value we are reliant on a number of other factors some of which our outside of our control for example our health solutions revenue line has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the us manage their growing health care expenses in order for these exchanges to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers benefits administrators software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers and providers of human resource among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions actions or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition we face risks as we transition from inhouse functions to thirdparty support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures cybersecurity incidents capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients or employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are then remitted to the insureds consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients this function creates a risk of loss arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions errors relating to transaction processing or other cybersecurity events or security breaches we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses the entry into new lines of business the integration of acquired businesses and the growth and development of these businesses 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms complete transactions and in the case of acquisitions successfully integrate them into our existing businesses if a proposed transaction is not consummated the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets 

from time to time either through acquisitions or internal development we enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business these new lines of business or new products and services present the company with additional risks particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed such risks include the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants external factors such as compliance with new or revised regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the divested business 

on may 1 2017 we sold the divested business to an entity controlled by affiliates of the blackstone group lp the “buyer” this transaction carries inherent risks including the risk that we will not earn the 500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction as well as risks connected with separating the divested business from aon we are party to a transition services agreement with the buyer and there are risks associated with this transition services agreement particularly as we transition off of the buyer’s systems and services and initiate our own new systems and processes which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

furthermore we have entered into ongoing commercial arrangements with the buyer if we do not realize the intended benefits of these arrangements it could affect our results of operations or adversely affect our relationship with clients partners colleagues and other third parties additionally if the divested business does not deliver the level of service to which our clients and partners are accustomed it could adversely affect our relationships with such third parties 

our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry 

in the past the attorney general of the state of new york brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community these actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices and the transparency and discourse to clients regarding brokers’ compensation it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future if they do so compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

transfers of the class a ordinary shares may be subject to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk which would increase the cost of dealing in the class a ordinary shares 

stamp duty reserve taxes “sdrt” are imposed in the uk on certain transfers of chargeable securities which include shares in companies incorporated in the uk at a rate of 05 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer certain transfers of shares to depositories or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 15 percent 

our class a ordinary shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of depository trust company “dtc” transfers of shares held in book entry form through dtc will not attract a charge to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk a transfer of the shares from within the dtc system out of dtc and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the dtc system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 05 percent of any consideration which is payable by the transferee of the shares any such duty must be paid and the relevant transfer document stamped by her majesty’s revenues and customs “hmrc” before the transfer can be registered in the share registers of aon if those shares are redeposited into dtc the redeposit will attract stamp duty or sdrt at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

we have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the dtc system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that sdrt may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository before the transfer can be registered in our share registers the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to sdrt which will be charged at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

if the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of dtc then transactions in our securities may be disrupted 

the facilities of dtc are a widely used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the dtc system which include many large banks and brokerage firms we believe that prior to our reincorporation in the uk in 2012 the “redomestication” approximately 99 of the outstanding shares of common stock of aon corporation were held within the dtc system the class a ordinary shares of aon plc are at present eligible for deposit and clearing within the dtc system in connection with the closing of the redomestication we entered into arrangements with dtc whereby we agreed to indemnify dtc for any stamp duty andor sdrt that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our class a ordinary shares in addition we have obtained a ruling from hmrc in respect of the stamp duty and sdrt consequences of the reorganization and sdrt has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of class a ordinary shares with the initial depository dtc will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the class a ordinary shares if dtc determines at any time that the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe the class a ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a us securities exchange or inclusion in the sp 500 and trading in the class a ordinary shares would 

be disrupted while we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the class a ordinary shares

impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties and because of this foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year’s revenue expenses and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a 008 favorable   impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2018  currency fluctuations had a 012 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2017  when 2016  results were translated at 2017  rates currency fluctuations had no impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2016  when 2015  results were translated at 2016  rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a 009 favorable   impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2018  currency fluctuations had a 008 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2017  when 2016  results were translated at 2017  rates currency fluctuations had a 004 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2016  when 2015  results were translated at 2016  rates these translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the financial statements

other liquidity matters 

distributable reserves 

as a company incorporated in england and wales we are required under uk law to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the uk parent company and among other methods through a reduction in share capital approved by the courts of england and wales distributable reserves are not linked to a us gaap reported amount eg retained earnings as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had distributable reserves in excess of 22 billion  and 12 billion  respectively we believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund shareholder dividends and make share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

credit facilities 

we expect cash generated by operations for 2018  to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations finance capital expenditures continue purchases of shares under the repurchase program and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed

restructuring 

workforce reduction costs 

the method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are onetime costs we account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts or we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula we recognize these costs when the likelihood of future settlement is probable and the amount of the related benefit is reasonably estimable or on a straightline basis over the remaining service period if applicable 

we estimate our onetime workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated we recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated notify the employees who might be included in the termination and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period when employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period 

lease consolidation costs 

where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it we recognize a loss the loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we provide notice of cancellation in accordance with contractual terms vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement to determine the loss we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties when we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee we adjust our sublease losses for actual outcomes 

fair value concepts of onetime workforce reduction costs and lease losses 

accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability where material we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time so no discounting is necessary 

for the remaining lease term we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount if material the discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate which matches the lifetime of the liability significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded 

asset impairments 

asset impairments relate to fixed assets and are accounted for in the period when they become known furthermore we record impairments by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life asset impairments are included in depreciation of fixed assets in the consolidated statements of income 

other associated costs of exit and disposal activities 

we recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred including separation costs moving costs and consulting and legal fees 

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada which are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our us uk netherlands and canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted 

the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in other income expense we used a fullyield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost 

components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the us uk netherlands and canada plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2018  our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2019  amortization of loss by country millions except amortization period 



the unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2018  was 3 million  30 million  and 7 million  for the us uk and other plans respectively 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2018  the marketrelated value of assets was 20 billion  we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2018  the fair value of plan assets was 18 billion  

our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of december 31 2018  



in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyze investmentcommunity forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we surveyed multiple thirdparty financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the investment policy for uk and other nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and other nonus categories our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan target allocations are subject to change 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point “bps” increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2018  in millions 



 holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2019  pension expense in millions 



holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 bps increase and decrease in our longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2019  pension expense in millions 



estimated future contributions 

we estimate cash contributions of approximately  145 million   to our pension plans in 2019  as compared with cash contributions of 252 million  in 2018  which includes our acceleration of contributions to the qualified us pension plan 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customerrelated and contractbased or technology and other 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others no events occurred during 2018  that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a “component” a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components are a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

when evaluating these assets for impairment we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount then the goodwill impairment test becomes a twostep analysis step 1 requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step 2 step 2 uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step 1 and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weightedaverage cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry based on tests performed in both 2018  and 2017  there was no indication of goodwill impairment and no further testing was required 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2018  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

restricted share units “rsus” are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

performance share awards “psas” are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation expense is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest plan is the leadership performance plan “lpp” which has a threeyear performance period as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense the 2016 to 2018 performance period ended on december 31 2018 the 2015 to 2017 performance period ended on december 31 2017 and the 2014 to 2016 performance period ended on december 31 2016 the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2017 to 2019 and 2018 to 2020 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2018  expense by approximately 21 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 60 million 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in this assessment significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination 

we base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the tax reform act was enacted into law and the new legislation contained several key tax provisions that impacted the company in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed registrants to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date since the tax reform act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation was expected certain items were considered provisional in the company’s financial statements for 2017 due to the forthcoming guidance and ongoing analysis of yearend data and tax positions in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company completed its analysis in accordance with sab 118 see note 11 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information and a detailed description of the impact of completing the accounting for 2017 

new accounting pronouncements 

note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the indian rupee and the japanese yen we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars euros and japanese yen but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2018  we have hedged approximately 45 of our uk subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the us dollar euro and japanese yen transactions for the years ending december 31 2019  2020  and 2021 respectively we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and shortterm assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 21 million  and 5 million  at december 31 2019  and 2020  respectively 

effective july 1 2018 argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy and therefore the functional currency for our argentina subsidiaries became the us dollar as a result the impact of argentine peso currency fluctuations in these subsidiaries is reported within the consolidated statements of income prospectively we are undergoing steps to limit this exposure and the impact to 2018 was insignificant revenue from our argentine operations was less than 1 of our consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the north america continental europe and the asia pacific region a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 42 million  to each of 2019  and 2020  pretax income a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 42 million  to each of 2019  and 2020  pretax income 

we have longterm debt outstanding with a fair market value of 62 billion  at both december 31 2018  and 2017  this fair value was greater than  the carrying value by 166 million  at december 31 2018  and 600 million   greater than  the carrying value at december 31 2017  a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 7  or an increase of 8  respectively at december 31 2018  

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

fiduciary funds 

we typically hold funds on behalf of clients including premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit to and from insurers these funds held on behalf of clients are generally invested in interestbearing premium trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients and when premiums are remitted to the insurance carriers the principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes though we earn interest on these accounts

seasonality 

due to buying patterns and delivery of certain products in the markets we serve revenues recognized tend to be higher in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 

licensing and regulation 

our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate including us federal and state laws see the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

regulatory authorities in the countries and states in the united states “us” in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individual or company licenses to act as producers brokers agents thirdparty administrators managing general agents reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters under the laws of most countries and states regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting renewing and revoking producers’ brokers’ and agents’ licenses to transact business in the country or state the operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular country or state which may require among other things that a firm operates in the country or state through a local corporation in a few countries and states licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities in such cases our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the country or state 

our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are enforced by the financial conduct authority “fca” in the united kingdom “uk” by federal and state agencies in the us and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business the licensing of agents the monitoring of trade practices policy form approval limits on commission rates and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements 

insurance authorities in the uk us and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

investment securities and futures licensing authorities also govern certain of our business activities for example in the us we use aon securities inc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member of the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and securities investor protection corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of aon for capital management transaction and advisory services and other brokerdealer activities similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the us 

further pension and financial laws and regulations including oversight and supervision by the fca in the uk the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the us and regulators in other countries govern certain of the retirementrelated consulting services provided by aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates this includes aon subsidiaries that provide investment advisory services regulated by various us federal authorities including the sec and finra as well as authorities on the state level in addition other services provided by aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates such as trustee services and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services are subject in various jurisdictions to pension investment securities and insurance laws and regulations and supervision

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect material risks associated with existing and potential business and contain “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in the “business” section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur 

the following are material risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere 

business risks 

an overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business 

the results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns volatility or uncertainty in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our commercial risk solutions reinsurance 

solutions and data and analytic services revenue lines the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business also error and omission claims against us which we refer to as errors and omissions “eo” claims may increase in economic downturns also adversely affecting our business 

we face significant competitive pressures 

as a global professional services firm we compete with global national regional and local insurance companies who market and service their own products other financial services providers brokers and investment managers independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms we compete with respect to service product features price commission structure financial strength ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition 

our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases greater name recognition more comprehensive products stronger presence in certain geographies or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have in addition new competitors alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster or price their services more aggressively they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do this competition is intensified by an industry trend where clients engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts if we fail to respond successfully to the competition we face our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected 

if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality advice and solutions focused on risk retirement and health if a client is not satisfied with our services it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups or trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums in addition claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones   negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and regulatory compliance this damage to our reputation could affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely effecting on our business financial condition and operating results 

revenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

revenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 

 the profitability of our consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

our profitability with respect to consulting engagements is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to changes in our business adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors cost of living adjustment provisions the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer our cost efficiencies may be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments our ability to secure new consulting engagements our ability to forecast demand for consulting services and consequently appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce employee attrition and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors andor assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies selection or removal of investment managers the investment in different investment instruments and products and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select such as investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control regardless of the cause clients experiencing losses may assert claims against us and these claims may be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions 

and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions additionally clients experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for our competitors 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the us these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows approximately 56  of our consolidated revenue is nonus attributed on the basis of where the services are performed and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and as a result changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results for example the strengthening of the value of the us dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to us dollar even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use were 1285 million  at december 31 2017  and are reported in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 37 billion  at december 31 2017  and are reported in fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2017  these longterm investments had a carrying value of 57 million  adverse changes in interest rates performance and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results we may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and shortterm investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced as we have experienced in japan and certain jurisdictions in the european union on the other hand higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company in addition during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work 

our pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in particular lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans in addition the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense as a result we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

our worldwide pension plans are significant and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market and demographic factors these factors include equity and bond market returns fair value of pension assets the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations in any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year in addition contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices which may differ from measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2017  we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 60 billion  the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we also are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2017  we had two committed credit facilities outstanding each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities included customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions or refinance any of our debt if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital reduce our financial flexibility and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy our senior debt ratings at december 31 2017  were a  with a stable outlook standard  poor’s or “sp” bbb  with a stable outlook fitch inc or “fitch” and baa2  with a stable outlook moody’s investor services or “moody’s” our commercial paper ratings were a2  sp f2  fitch and p2  moody’s 

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities such changes could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies a change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position 

the benefits of our redomestication may not be realized or may be offset in whole or in part by factors that we do not control 

in 2012 we reincorporated in the uk and moved our corporate headquarters to london the “redomestication” as a result of this reorganization of our corporate structure aon plc became the publiclyheld parent company of the aon group there can be no assurance that all of the goals of our redomestication will be achievable 

our effective tax rates and the benefits from our redomestication are subject to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our ability to control such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the uk the us and other countries the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions currency exchange rate fluctuations especially as between the british pound and the us dollar and significant changes in trade monetary or fiscal policies of the uk or the us including changes in interest rates the impact of these factors individually and in the aggregate is difficult to predict in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances may be interrelated and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or alternatively reduced offset or more than offset by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors 

on september 4 2013 we received from the internal revenue service the “irs” an executed closing agreement pursuant to which the company and the irs agreed that the merger pursuant to which the redomestication occurred did not cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes this agreement substantially reduced the risk that actions taken to date might cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes under the current tax statute and regulations however the us congress the irs the uk parliament or uk tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a nonus corporation or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past and there can be no assurance that any 

such provisions if enacted or promulgated would not have retroactive application to us the redomestication or any subsequent actions our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we were to be subject to us corporate income tax as a domestic corporation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the uk and other jurisdictions including the us or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties could subject us to increased taxation 

us federal income tax reform could create uncertainty and adversely affect our business and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 us federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” was signed into law significantly changing the us internal revenue code these changes include among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate subjecting certain future foreign subsidiary earnings whether or not distributed to us tax under a global intangible lowtaxed income provision imposing a new alternative “base erosion and antiabuse tax” on us corporations that limits deductions for certain amounts payable to foreign affiliates imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest payable to related and unrelated lenders further limiting deductible executive compensation and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries through the end of 2017 we continue to analyze how the tax reform act may impact our results of operations the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax reform act the company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts possibly materially due to among other things additional analysis of the law changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions the company may take as a result of the tax reform act this continued analysis and resulting uncertainty along with many of the changes effected pursuant to the tax reform act may have an adverse or volatile effect on our tax rate in fiscal years 2018 and beyond thereby affecting our results of operations 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that tax rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the uk us and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation such as the us tax reform act detailed above our global mix of earnings the use of global funding structures the tax characteristics of our income the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments and the portion of the income of nonus subsidiaries that may be subject to us tax whether or not distributed to us shareholders significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities 

we believe that our redomestication and related transactions should support our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the uk has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject nonuk earnings to uk tax when such earnings are repatriated to the uk in the form of dividends from nonuk subsidiaries this should allow us to optimize our capital allocation through global funding structures however we cannot provide any assurances as to what our tax rate will be in any period because of among other things uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions as well as changes in us and other tax laws treaties and regulations our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of the uk the us and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate 

we also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other changes such as those in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law audits and other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including 

but not limited to those relating to revenue recognition restructuring pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables valuation of goodwill and intangibles contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments in accounting principles and other factors actual results could differ from these estimates or changes in assumptions estimates policies or developments in the business may change our initial estimates which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders’ equity and cash flows 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other longlived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other longlived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other longlied intangible assets future goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

the company is organized as a holding company a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities as a holding company without significant operations of its own our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payment to us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to errors and omissions claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the company as a whole 

we assist our clients with various matters including placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters providing actuarial services investment consulting and asset management services eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or the failure to give errorfree advice in our consulting business it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others the maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications 

if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods any anticipated payment amounts under guarantees and indemnifications that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable are included in our consolidated financial statements these amounts may not represent actual future payments if any for these guarantees and indemnifications 

the ultimate outcome of these claims lawsuits proceedings guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or increase competition 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the uk companies act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the fca the us securities laws including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection trade restriction and export controls antimoney laundering wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we serve or enter the methods by which we sell our products and services the prices we can charge for our services or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act “fatca” in the us and the bribery act of 2010 “uk bribery act” in the uk impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in several cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity additionally our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions could impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services or even cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past 

in addition new regulatory or industry developments could result in changes that adversely affect us these developments include 



 changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance for instance the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” effective in may 2018 creates a range of new compliance obligations increases financial penalties for noncompliance and extends the scope of the european union data protection law to all companies processing data of european union residents wherever the company’s location complying with the gdpr will cause us to incur substantial operational costs and may require us to change our business practices 

our business’ regulatory oversight generally also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or general underwriting operations and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client 

services provided in our health solutions and retirement solutions revenue line are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients in particular our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the us insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans uncertainty regarding or any changes to state or federal law or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies including the effects of health care reform by the us government could delay client adoption of our healthcare exchanges impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our healthcare exchanges or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions in addition changes in laws government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans such as medical defined contribution plans such as 401k or defined benefit plans such as pension may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 

if we violate the laws and regulation to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

in addition our businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations increased government involvement or enforcement actions for instance increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities additionally we operate in many different business lines which may occasionally intersect with each other such as placing both insurance and reinsurance or providing both investment consultancy and fiduciary management services if we fail to control possible resulting conflicts of interest we could be subject to civil litigation fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from participating in one or more lines of business as regulators and other government agencies continue to examine our operations there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future these and other initiatives from national state and local officials may subject us to judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause us to be required to restructure or divest operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues higher operational costs business disruption or loss thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition or operating results 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates employees clients strategic partners and others however the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we have less flexibility as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

english law imposes additional restrictions on certain corporate actions for example english law provides that a board of directors may only allot or issue securities with the prior authorization of shareholders such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2018 this authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting 

english law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for the articles of association or shareholders in general meeting to exclude preemptive rights such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2018 this exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting 

english law also requires us to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the uk parent company or other actions as of december 31 2017 we had distributable reserves in excess of 12 billion  while it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases there is no assurance that the parent company level will continue to generate sufficient earnings in order to maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to do so 

english law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “off market purchases” without the prior approval of our shareholders such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years our shares are traded on the nyse which is not a recognized investment exchange in the uk consequently any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “off market purchase” the current authorization expires on june 17 2020 renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically 

the enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult 

because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in us courts than would have been the case for a us company in addition it may be more difficult or impossible to bring some types of claims against us in courts in england than it would be to bring similar claims against a us company in a us court 

we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales therefore it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the us in order to enforce judgments of us courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 

there is doubt as to the enforceability in england and wales in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts of civil liabilities solely based on the us federal securities laws the english courts will however treat any amount payable by us under us judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the english courts to enforce this debt against us the following criteria must be satisfied in order for the english court to enforce the debt created by the us judgment 



 if an english court gives judgment for the sum payable under a us judgment the english judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose these methods generally permit the english court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement also note that in any enforcement proceedings the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in england unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the us proceedings 

operational risks 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency 

furthermore the uk’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the european union as they negotiate the terms of the withdrawal as the uk and european union negotiate these terms we are uncertain about the agreements they will reach on topics such as financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements immigration laws and employment laws our publicly traded parent is incorporated in the uk and we have significant operations and a substantial workforce therein and therefore enjoy certain benefits based on the uk’s membership in the european union the lack of clarity about brexit and the future uk laws and regulations creates uncertainty for us as the outcome of these negotiations may affect our business and operations additionally there is also a risk that other countries may decide to leave the european union the uncertainty surrounding brexit not only potentially affects our business in the uk and the european union but may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reducing the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency us credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

we may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives 

in 2017 we initiated a global restructuring plan the “restructuring plan” in connection with the sale of the divested business the restructuring plan is intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency insight and connectivity we expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations through 2019 including an estimated 4200  to 4800  role eliminations the restructuring plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately 1025 million  through the end of the restructuring plan consisting of approximately 450 million  in employee termination costs 130 million  in it rationalization costs 85 million  in real estate realization costs 50 million  in asset impairment costs and 310 million  in other costs associated with the restructuring included in the estimated 1025 million  is 50 million of estimated noncash charges 

we estimate that our annualized savings from the restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately 450 million by the end of 2019 actual total costs savings and timing may vary from these estimates due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives we therefore cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings unanticipated costs or unrealized savings in connection with the restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other professional personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships the unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy competition for experienced professional personnel is intense and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected while we have plans for key management succession and longterm compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively our business could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in and sourcing from foreign countries including 

 the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods tornadoes climate events or weather patterns and pandemic health events as well as manmade disasters including acts of terrorism military actions and cyberterrorism the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breaches power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of existing new or upgraded computer 

systems telecommunications and other related systems and operations in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations we could potentially lose access to key executives personnel or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses security breaches unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees we are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through increasingly sophisticated methods of attack because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures we regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access while we select our third party vendors carefully problems with the information technology systems of those vendors including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes cyberattacks and security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business additionally we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack these types of incidents affecting us or our thirdparty vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data in addition we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues additionally in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or harm to our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information including confidential information about our clients’ employees’ compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs loss of revenue and loss of clients the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

in many jurisdictions including in the european union and the us we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive additionally certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach these notice provisions 

present operational challenges and related risk in particular the european union’s gdpr will go into effect in may 2018 despite our efforts to bring practices into compliance before the gdpr’s effective date we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors such as a lack of vendor cooperation noncompliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith we may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new european or multinational customers due to the compliance cost potential risk exposure and difficulty in negotiating the allocation of risk related to the handling of data compliance with the gdpr may also cause distraction from other aspects of our business our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impair our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools conversely investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary databases repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process our competitors are developing competing databases and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions innovations in software cloud computing or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments 

we are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets nevertheless for those efforts to produce meaningful value we are reliant on a number of other factors some of which our outside of our control for example our health solutions revenue line has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the us manage their growing health care expenses in order for these exchanges to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers benefits administrators software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers and providers of human resource among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions actions or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients andor employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

certain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are then remitted to the insureds consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients this function creates a risk of loss arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions errors relating to transaction processing or other 

cybersecurity events or security breaches we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses the entry into new lines of business the integration of acquired businesses and the growth and development of these businesses 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms complete transactions and in the case of acquisitions successfully integrate them into our existing businesses if a proposed transaction is not consummated the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets 

from time to time either through acquisitions or internal development we enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business these new lines of business or new products and services present the company with additional risks particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed such risks include the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants external factors such as compliance with new or revised regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of our benefits administration and hr business process outsourcing business 

on february 9 2017 we entered into a purchase agreement with tempo acquisition llc to sell our divested business to the buyer an entity controlled by affiliates of the blackstone group lp on may 1 2017 the transaction was consummated and the buyer purchased all of the outstanding equity interests in each of the divested business’s subsidiaries plus certain related assets for a purchase price of i 43 billion  in cash paid at closing subject to customary adjustments set forth in the purchase agreement and ii deferred consideration of up to 500 million  plus the assumption of certain liabilities cash proceeds from the sale before taxes and after customary adjustments as set forth in the purchase agreement were 42 billion  

this transaction carries inherent risks including the risk that aon will not earn the 500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction as well as risks connected with separating the divested business from aon because the divested business represented 19  of our gross revenues for the fiscal year 2016 our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected or may not be accretive to adjusted earnings per share as anticipated if we fail to effectively reduce our overhead costs to reflect the reduced scale of operations or fail to grow our other business as expected additionally the separation of the divested businesses from the rest of aon’s business requires significant resources which may disrupt operations or divert management’s attention from aon’s daytoday operations and efforts to grow our other businesses we are party to a transition services agreement with the buyer under which we provide certain services to the buyer and the buyer provides certain systems or services to us there are risks associated with this transition services agreement particularly as we transition off of the buyer’s systems and services and initiate our own new systems and processes which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

furthermore we have entered into ongoing commercial arrangements with the buyer if we do not realize the intended benefits of these arrangements it could affect our results of operations or adversely affect our relationship with clients partners colleagues and other third parties additionally if the divested business does not deliver the level of service to which our clients and partners are accustomed it could adversely affect our relationships with such third parties 

our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry 

in the past the attorney general of the state of new york brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community these actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future if they do so compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

transfers of the class a ordinary shares may be subject to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk which would increase the cost of dealing in the class a ordinary shares 

stamp duty reserve taxes “sdrt” are imposed in the uk on certain transfers of chargeable securities which include shares in companies incorporated in the uk at a rate of 05 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 15 percent 

our class a ordinary shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of depository trust company “dtc” transfers of shares held in book entry form through dtc will not attract a charge to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk a transfer of the shares from within the dtc system out of dtc and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the dtc system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 05 percent of any consideration which is payable by the transferee of the shares any such duty must be paid and the relevant transfer document stamped by her majesty’s revenues and customs “hmrc” before the transfer can be registered in the books of aon if those shares are redeposited into dtc the redeposit will attract stamp duty or sdrt at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

we have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the dtc system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that sdrt may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository before the transfer can be registered in our books the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to sdrt which will be charged at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

following the decision of the first tier tribunal tax chamber in hsbc holdings plc the bank of new york mellon corporation v hmrc  2012 ukftt 163 tc and the announcement by hmrc that it will not seek to appeal the decision hmrc is no longer enforcing the charge to sdrt on the issue of shares into either eu or noneu depository receipt or clearance systems 

if the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of dtc then transactions in our securities may be disrupted 

the facilities of dtc are a widelyused mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the dtc system which include many large banks and brokerage firms we believe that prior to the redomestication approximately 99 of the outstanding shares of common stock of aon corporation were held within the dtc system the class a ordinary shares of aon plc are at present eligible for deposit and clearing within the dtc system in connection with the closing of the redomestication we entered into arrangements with dtc whereby we agreed to indemnify dtc for any stamp duty andor sdrt that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our class a ordinary shares in addition we have obtained a ruling from hmrc in respect of the stamp duty and sdrt consequences of the reorganization and sdrt has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of class a ordinary shares with the initial depository dtc will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the class a ordinary shares if dtc determines at any time that the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe the class a ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a us securities exchange or inclusion in the sp 500 and trading in the class a ordinary shares would be disrupted while we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the class a ordinary shares

organic revenue growth

impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we conduct business in more than 120 countries and because of this foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the last year’s revenue expenses and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had an 012 favorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2017  currency fluctuations had no impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2016  when 2015  results were translated at 2016  rates currency fluctuations had a 043 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2015  when 2014  results were translated at 2015  rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a 008 favorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2017  currency fluctuations had a 004 unfavorable impact on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2016  when 2015  results were translated at 2016  rates currency fluctuations had a 044 unfavorable impact on net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2015  when 2014  results were translated at 2015  rates these translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

restructuring plan 

in 2017 we initiated a global restructuring plan the “restructuring plan” in connection with the sale of the divested business the restructuring plan is intended to streamline operations across the organization and deliver greater efficiency insight and connectivity we expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations through 2019 including an estimated 4200  to 4800  role eliminations we expect to result in cumulative costs of approximately 1025 million  through the end of the plan consisting of approximately 450 million  in employee termination costs 130 million  in technology rationalization costs 85 million  in real estate consolidation costs 50 million  in noncash asset impairments such as expense taken on software no longer in use and 310 million  in other costs including certain separation costs associated with the sale of the divested business we estimate that our annualized savings from the restructuring plan and other operational improvement initiatives will be approximately 450 million by the end of 2019 

from the inception of the restructuring plan through december 31 2017  the company has eliminated 2630  positions and incurred total expenses of 497 million  for restructuring and related separation costs these charges are included in compensation and benefits information technology premises depreciation of fixed assets and other general expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

the following table summarizes restructuring and separation costs by type that have been incurred through december 31 2017  and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring plan in millions estimated remaining costs may be revised in future periods as these assumptions are updated 





as of december 31 2017  our liabilities for the restructuring plan were as follows in millions 

competition and markets authority 

the uk’s competition regulator the competition and markets authority the “cma” is conducting a market investigation into the supply and acquisition of investment consulting and fiduciary management services including those offered by aon and its competitors in the uk the cma has indicated that it will assess whether any feature or combination of features in the target market prevents restricts or distorts competition the cma can impose a wide range of remedies to address uncompetitive markets the investigation is in its early stages thus we are not presently in a position to estimate the impact if any of this investigation on aon’s uk investment business

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under our credit facilities our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases pension obligations and shareholder dividends we believe that cash flows from operations available credit facilities and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including principal and interest payments on debt obligations capital expenditures pension contributions and anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes as well as amounts restricted as to their use funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in fiduciary assets in the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding amount in fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds generally cannot be used for general corporate purposes and are not a source of liquidity for us 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased   569 million  to 1285 million  in 2017  as compared to 2016  during 2017  sources of funds in 2017  included proceeds from the sale of businesses of 4246 million  during 2017  cash flow from operating activities decreased   1160 million  to 669 million  additional primary uses of funds in 2017  included share repurchases of 24 billion  acquisitions of businesses of 1029 million  dividends to shareholders of 364 million  repayments of debt net of issuances  of 345 million  and purchases of shortterm investments of 232 million  

to manage unforeseen situations we have committed credit lines of approximately 13 billion  and we endeavor to manage our obligations to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings at december 31 2017  we had no borrowings on these credit lines 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2017   decreased   1592 million  or 68  to 734 million  compared to 2016  net cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations during 2017   decreased   1160 million  or 63  from the prior year to 669 million  net cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations during 2017   decreased   432 million  or 87  from the prior year to 65 million  these amounts represent net income reported as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses financial instruments and foreign exchange and our noncash expenses which include sharebased compensation 

depreciation amortization and impairments as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the collection of receivables the total decrease  in operating cash from the prior year was primarily driven by higher cash tax charges largely related to the sale of the divested business and an increase in pension contributions 

pension cash contributions were 146 million  during 2017  as compared to 123 million  during 2016  in 2018  we expect to contribute approximately 177 million  to our pension plans with the majority attributable to nonus pension plans which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates on july 1 2017 the company made noncash contributions of approximately 80 million to its us pension plan 

we expect cash generated by operations for 2017  to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations finance capital expenditures repurchase shares under the repurchase program and pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities we have the ability to access commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows we have committed credit facilities of approximately 13 billion  all of which was available at december 31 2017  and can access these facilities on a sameday or nextday basis additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed

during 2017  the company repurchased 180 million shares at an average price per share of 13367  for a total cost of 24 billion  and recorded an additional 120 million  of costs associated with the repurchases to retained earnings included in the 180 million  shares were 118 thousand shares that did not settle until january 2018 these shares were settled at an average price per share of 13441 and total cost of 159 million during 2016  the company repurchased 122 million shares at an average price 

per share of 10266 for a total cost of 13 billion  and recorded an additional 60 million  of costs associated with the repurchases to retained earnings at december 31 2017  the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the repurchase program was 54 billion  under the repurchase program the company has repurchased a total of 1082 million  shares for an aggregate cost of approximately 96 billion  

for information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2017  see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” as previously described 

dividends 

during 2017  2016  and 2015  we paid dividends of 364 million  345 million  and 323 million  respectively to holders of our class a ordinary shares dividends paid per class a ordinary share were 141  129  and 115  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

distributable reserves 

as a company incorporated in england and wales we are required under uk law to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the uk parent company distributable reserves are not linked to a us gaap reported amount eg retained earnings as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had distributable reserves in excess of 12 billion  and 16 billion  respectively we believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund shareholder dividends if and to the extent declared for the foreseeable future 

borrowings 

total debt at december 31 2017  was 60 billion  a decrease  of 239 million  compared to december 31 2016  commercial paper activity during the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  is as follows 



the proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for shortterm working capital needs 

on may 27 2016 500 million  of 3125  senior notes due may 2016 issued by aon corporation matured and were repaid in full 

on march 1 2016 aon plc issued 750 million  of 3875  senior notes due december 2025 the company used the proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2017  we had two  committed credit facilities outstanding its 900 million  multicurrency us credit facility expiring in february 2021 the “2021 facility” and a 400 million  multicurrency us credit facility expiring in october 2022 the “2022 facility” the 2022 facility was entered into on october 19 2017 each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities includes customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to consolidated adjusted ebitda tested quarterly at december 31 2017  we did not have borrowings under either the 2021 or the 2022 facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended december 31 2017  

shelf registration statement 

on september 3 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of among other securities debt securities preference shares class a ordinary shares and convertible securities our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand market conditions and other factors 

rating agency ratings 

the major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at february 20 2018  appear in the table below 



a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to debt capital reduce our financial flexibility increase our commercial paper interest rates or restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether andor impact future pension contribution requirements 

guarantees and indemnifications 

sale of the divested business 

in connection with the sale of the divested business we guaranteed future operating lease commitments related to certain facilities assumed by the buyer we are obligated to perform under the guarantees if the divested business defaults on the leases at any time during the remainder of the lease agreements which expire on various dates through 2024 as of december 31 2017  the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the lease guarantee were 100 million  with an estimated fair value of 23 million  

additionally we are subject to performance guarantee requirements under certain client arrangements that were assumed by the buyer should the divested business fail to perform as required by the terms of the arrangements we would be required to fulfill the remaining contract terms which expire on various dates through 2023 as of december 31 2017  the undiscounted maximum potential future payments under the performance guarantees were 212 million  which an estimated fair value of 1 million  

letters of credit and other guarantee s 

we have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit “locs” we had total locs outstanding of approximately 96 million  at december 31 2017  compared to 90 million  at december 31 2016  these locs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our us and canadian nonqualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program we also have obtained locs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries 

we have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies the maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately 95 million  at december 31 2017  which is unchanged as compared to december 31 2016  

other liquidity matters 

we do not have material exposure related to off balance sheet arrangements our cash flows from operations borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties see item 1 “information concerning forwardlooking statements” and item 1a “risk factors” 

contractual obligations 

summarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2017  payments by year due are estimated as follows in millions 



pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the employee retirement income security act “erisa” and other regulations as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed to with or required by the uk pension plan trustees nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments we may make additional discretionary contributions 

in 2017 our principal uk subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the uk plans to contribute £44 million 59 million at december 31 2017 exchange rates through 2019 which is estimated to bring the plan to 100 funded basis contributions were based on the 2016 valuation and no further contributions are forecasted after 2019 the trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our uk subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined windingup deficit as of december 31 2017 the estimated windingup deficit was £122 million 163 million at december 31 2017 exchange rates the trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreedupon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the windingup deficit be paid 

purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered and the timing of the transactions most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts purchase obligations exclude 280 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the periods when potential cash settlements will be made 

financial condition 

at december 31 2017  our net assets representing total assets minus total liabilities were 46 billion  a decrease  from 55 billion  at december 31 2016  the decrease  was due primarily to share repurchases of 24 billion  and dividends to shareholders of 364 million  partially offset by net income of 13 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  and a decrease  in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 416 million  related primarily to foreign currency translation working capital increased  by 271 million  from 651 million  at december 31 2016  to 922 million  at december 31 2017  

accumulated other comprehensive loss 

accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased   416 million  to 3496 million  at december 31 2017  as compared to 3912 million  at december 31 2016  which was primarily driven by the following 



critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with us gaap to prepare these financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 

in accordance with our policies we regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to those concerning restructuring revenue recognition pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes and base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we use to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

restructuring 

workforce reduction costs 

the method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are onetime costs we account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts or we have an established pattern of paying by a specific formula we recognize these costs when the likelihood of future settlement is probable and the amount of the related benefit is reasonably estimable or on a straightline basis over the remaining service period if applicable 

we estimate our onetime workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated we recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated notify the employees who might be included in the termination and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period when employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period 

lease consolidation costs 

where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it we recognize a loss the loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we provide notice of cancellation in accordance with contractual terms vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement to determine the loss we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties when we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee we adjust our sublease losses for actual outcomes 

fair value concepts of onetime workforce reduction costs and lease losses 

accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability where material we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time so no discounting is necessary 

for the remaining lease term we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount if material the discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate which matches the lifetime of the liability significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded 

asset impairments 

asset impairments are accounted for in the period when they become known furthermore we record impairments by reducing the book value to the net present value of future cash flows in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life asset impairments are included in depreciation of fixed assets in the consolidated statements of income 

other associated costs of exit and disposal activities 

we recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred including separation costs moving costs and consulting and legal fees 

revenue recognition 

revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable the company considers revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when all of the following four conditions are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 3 delivery or performance has occurred and 4 collectability is reasonably assured 

for brokerage commissions revenue is typically recognized at the completion of the placement process or over a period of time based on the transfer of value to customers or as the remuneration becomes determinable assuming all four criteria required to recognize revenue have been met the placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data 

fees paid by clients for consulting or other nonbrokerage services are typically charged on an hourly project or fixedfee basis revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus arrangements are recognized as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met revenues from fixedfee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportionalperformance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement revenues from investment income on funds held on behalf of clients are recognized as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met reimbursements received for outofpocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues 

revenues from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants net of a reserve for estimated cancellations assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met 

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada which are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our us uk netherlands and canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted 

in 2016 and 2017 we used a fullyield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows in 2015 and prior years we had estimated these components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost by applying a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve and used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the us the netherlands canada and uk plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2017  our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2018  amortization of loss by country millions except amortization period 



the unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2017  was 5 million  19 million  and 7 million  for the us uk and other plans respectively 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2017  the marketrelated value of assets was 19 billion  we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2017  the fair value of plan assets was 20 billion  

our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of december 31 2017  



in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyze investmentcommunity forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we surveyed multiple thirdparty financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the investment policy for uk and other nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and other nonus categories our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan target allocations are subject to change 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2017  in millions 



 holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our estimated 2018  pension expense in millions 



holding other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2018  pension expense in millions 



estimated future contributions 

we estimate cash contributions of approximately 177 million  to our pension plans in 2018  as compared with cash contributions of 146 million  in 2017  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customerrelated and contractbased or technology and other 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we also test the acquired tradenames for impairment we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others no events occurred during 2017  that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a “component” a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components is a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

the goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value including goodwill of the corresponding reporting unit if the “more likely than not” threshold is not met then the goodwill impairment test becomes a twostep analysis step 1 requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step 2 step 2 uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step 1 and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weightedaverage cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry based on tests performed in both 2017  and 2016  there was no indication of goodwill impairment and no further testing was required 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2017  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

restricted share units “rsus” are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

performance share awards “psas” are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation cost is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest performancebased sharebased payment award plan is the leadership performance plan “lpp” which has a threeyear performance period the 2015 to 2017 performance period ended on december 31 2017 the 2014 to 2016 performance period ended on december 31 2016 and the 2013 to 2015 performance period ended on december 31 2015 the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2016 to 2018 and 2017 to 2019 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2017  expense by approximately 59 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 59 million as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in this assessment significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination 

we base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that impact the company including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings the “transition tax” among others the company is required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment including the determination of the transition tax and remeasuring of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date since the tax reform act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting 

interpretation is expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting for certain items to be provisional due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions the company expects to complete its analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 see note 10 in these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and a detailed description of the items for which the accounting is provisional 

new accounting pronouncements 

note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the indian rupee and the japanese yen we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars euros and japanese yen but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2017  we have hedged approximately 45 of our uk subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the us dollar euro and japanese yen transactions for the years ending december 31 2018  2019  and 2020 respectively we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and shortterm assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 31 million  and 14 million  at december 31 2018  and 2019  respectively 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the north america continental europe and the asia pacific region a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 416 million  to each of 2018  and 2019  pretax income a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 416 million  to each of 2018  and 2019  pretax income 

we have longterm debt outstanding with a fair market value of 63 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  this fair value was greater than  the carrying value by 600 million  at december 31 2017  and 395 million   greater than  the carrying value at december 31 2016  a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 8  or an increase of 9  respectively at december 31 2017  

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

licensing and regulation 

our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate as well as us federal and state laws see the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

risk solutions 

regulatory authorities in the countries or states in the us in which the operating subsidiaries of our risk solutions segment conduct business may require individual or company licensing to act as producers brokers agents thirdparty administrators managing general agents reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters 

under the laws of most countries and states regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting renewing and revoking producers’ brokers’ and agents’ licenses to transact business in the country or state the operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular country or state which may require among other things that a firm operates in the country or state through a local corporation in a few countries and states licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities in such cases our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the country or state 

our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are enforced by the financial conduct authority “fca” in the uk by federal and state agencies in the us and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business licensing of agents monitoring of trade practices policy form approval limits on commission rates and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements 

insurance authorities in the uk us and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

further certain of our business activities within the risk solutions segment are governed by other regulatory bodies including investment securities and futures licensing authorities for example in the us we use aon securities inc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member of the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and securities investor protection corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of aon for capital management transaction and advisory services and other brokerdealer activities similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the us

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect material risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in the “business” section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur 

the following are material risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere 

risks relating to the company generally 

competitive risks 

an overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our businesses 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our risk solutions business the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premium charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect our risk solutions business as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business also error and omission claims against us which we refer to as eo claims may increase in economic downturns also adversely affecting our brokerage business 

the results of our hr solutions business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected in addition our revenues from many of our outsourcing contracts depend upon the number of our clients’ employees or the number of participants in our clients’ employee benefit plans and could be adversely affected by layoffs we may also experience decreased demand for our services as a result of postponed or terminated outsourcing of human resources functions reduced demand for our services could increase price competition 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

we believe that competition in our risk solutions segment is based on service product features price commission structure financial strength ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition in this regard we compete with a large number of global national regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers 

our hr solutions segment competes with a large number of independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world many of our competitors in this area are expanding the services they offer or reducing prices in an attempt to gain additional business additionally some competitors have established and are likely to continue to establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs 

our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases greater name recognition stronger presence in certain geographies and more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than 

we have in addition new competitors alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster or price their services more aggressively they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower the cost of our services or decrease the level of service provided to clients which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the united states these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our five largest nonus dollar exposures are the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and indian rupee however we also have exposures to other currencies that can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and as a result changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results for example the strengthening of the value of the us dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to us dollar even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use were 721 million  at december 31 2016  and are reported in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 38 billion  at december 31 2016  and are reported in fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2016  these longterm investments had a carrying value of 119 million  adverse changes in interest rates performance and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and shortterm investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or if negative yields on deposits or investments as we have experienced in japan and certain jurisdictions in the european union continue or arise in the jurisdictions in which we operate on the other hand higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company in addition during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work 

our pension obligations could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in particular lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans in addition the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense as a result we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

our worldwide pension plans are significant therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market and demographic factors these factors include equity and bond market returns the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations in any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2016  we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 62 billion  the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we also are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2016  we had two committed credit facilities outstanding each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities included customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions or refinance any of our debt if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital reduce our financial flexibility and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy our senior debt ratings at december 31 2016  were a  with a stable outlook standard  poor’s bbb  with a stable outlook fitch inc and baa2  with a stable outlook moody’s investor services our commercial paper ratings were a2  sp f2  fitch and p2  moody’s 

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities such changes could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies a change in our credit rating could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency 

furthermore seemingly nationally or regionally localized political and economic changes could have a wider negative impact on our businesses that expands beyond our operations in the immediately affected jurisdiction the united kingdom’s anticipated formal initiation of a withdrawal process from the european union has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and has given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider withdrawal these developments have created uncertainty and may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets lack of clarity about future united kingdom laws and regulations including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements immigration laws and employment laws could also depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally the continued concerns regarding the ability of certain european countries to service their outstanding debt has led to questions regarding the future viability of the euro as the common currency for the area as various scenarios could result in some countries choosing to return to their former local currencies in an effort to regain control over their domestic economies and monetary policies this uncertainty has had a dampening effect on growth potential in europe and if it deteriorates may have a material negative impact on our european business as well as that of our clients further any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets or profitability denominated in that currency 

potentially result in charges to our statement of operations and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency us credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

the benefits of our redomestication may not be realized or may be offset in whole or in part by factors that we do not control 

in 2012 we reincorporated in the uk and moved our corporate headquarters to london as a result of this reorganization of our corporate structure aon plc became the publiclyheld parent company of the aon group there can be no assurance that all of the goals of our redomestication will be achievable particularly as the achievement of the benefits are in many important respects subject to factors that we do not control these factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors analysts and uk and us taxing and other authorities 

our effective tax rates and the benefits from our redomestication are also subject to a variety of other factors many of which are beyond our ability to control such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the uk the us and other countries the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions currency exchange rate fluctuations especially as between the british pound and the us dollar and significant changes in trade monetary or fiscal policies of the uk or the us including changes in interest rates the impact of these factors individually and in the aggregate is difficult to predict in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances may be interrelated and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or alternatively reduced offset or more than offset by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors 

on september 4 2013 we received from the internal revenue service the “irs” an executed closing agreement pursuant to which the company and the irs agreed that the merger pursuant to which the redomestication occurred did not cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes this agreement substantially reduced the risk that actions taken to date might cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes under the current tax statute and regulations however the united states congress the irs the united kingdom parliament or uk tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a nonus corporation or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past and there can be no assurance that any such provisions if enacted or promulgated would not have retroactive application to us the redomestication or any subsequent actions our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we were to be subject to us corporate income tax as a domestic corporation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the uk and other jurisdictions including the us or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties could subject us to increased taxation 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that tax rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the uk us and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation our global mix of earnings including the use of global funding structures the tax characteristics of our income the transfer pricing of revenues and costs acquisitions and dispositions and the portion of the income of nonus subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities 

we believe that our redomestication and related transactions should support our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the uk has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject nonuk earnings to uk tax when such earnings are repatriated to the uk in the form of dividends from nonuk subsidiaries this should allow us to optimize our capital allocation through global funding structures however we cannot provide any assurances as to what our tax rate will be in any period because of among other things uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions as well as changes in us and other tax laws treaties and regulations our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of the uk the us and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate 

we also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other changes such as those in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law audits and 

other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those relating to restructuring pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables contingencies sharebased payments income taxes and estimates and assumptions used for our long term outsourcing contracts we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments in accounting principles and other factors actual results could differ from these estimates or changes in assumptions estimates or policies or the developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to longterm contracts may change our initial estimates of future contract results which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders’ equity and cash flows 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under us gaap we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

our principal assets are the shares of capital stock and indebtedness of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligation paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that these subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payment to us in addition due to differences in tax rates repatriation of funds from certain countries into the uk through the us could have unfavorable tax ramifications for us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to eo claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the company as a whole 

we assist our clients with various matters including placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters providing actuarial services investment consulting and asset management services and outsourcing various human resources functions eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured the failure to give errorfree advice in our consulting business or the failure to correctly execute transactions in the human resources outsourcing and benefits administration businesses it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others the maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods any anticipated payment amounts under guarantees and indemnifications that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable are included in our consolidated financial statements these amounts may not represent actual future payments if any for these guarantees and indemnifications 

the ultimate outcome of these claims lawsuits proceedings guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or increase competition 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the uk companies act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the financial conduct authority the “fca” the us securities laws including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance by limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including training and employee expenses adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act “fatca” in the us and the bribery act of 2010 “uk bribery act” in the uk impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in a number of cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries 

for example fatca has resulted in and will likely continue to result in increased compliance costs fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties in addition regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our operations results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations changes in application or interpretation of laws and regulations and our continued operational changes and development into new jurisdictions and new service offerings also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject these changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or lines of businesses and other developments in our services 

we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past 

in addition new regulatory or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us these developments include 

 changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance likewise increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

with respect to our risk solutions segment our business’ regulatory oversight generally also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or general underwriting operations and thirdparty administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance broking and thirdparty administration in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client 

services provided in our hr solutions segment are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated thereby indirectly impacting the manner in which we provide services to those clients in particular our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the us insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans uncertainty regarding or any changes to state or federal law or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies including the effects of health care reform by the us government could delay client adoption of our healthcare exchanges impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our healthcare exchanges or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions in addition more generally within our hr solutions segment changes in laws government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans such as medical defined contribution plans such as 401k defined benefit plans such as pension or payroll delivery may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 

if we violate the laws and regulation to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

in addition our businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions as regulators and other government agencies continue to examine our operations there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future these and other initiatives from national state and local officials may subject us to judgments settlements fines or penalties or 

cause us to be required to restructure its operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues or higher operational costs thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition or operating results 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates employees clients strategic partners and others however the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we have less flexibility as a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

english law imposes some restrictions on certain corporate actions by which previously as a delaware corporation we were not constrained for example english law provides that a board of directors may only allot or issue securities with the prior authorization of shareholders such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2017 this authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting 

english law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for the articles of association or shareholders in general meeting to exclude preemptive rights such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2017 this exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting 

english law also requires us to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the uk parent company as of december 31 2016 we had distributable reserves in excess of 16 billion while it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases in accordance with our share repurchase program there is no assurance that the parent company level will continue to generate sufficient earnings in order to maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to do so 

english law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “off market purchases” without the prior approval of our shareholders such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years our shares are traded on the nyse which is not a recognized investment exchange in the uk consequently any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “off market purchase” the current authorization expires on june 17 2020 renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically 

the enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult 

because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in us courts than would have been the case for us judgments obtained against aon corporation in addition it may be more difficult or impossible to bring some types of claims against us in courts in england than it would be to bring similar claims against a us company in a us court 

we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales therefore it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the united states in order to enforce judgments of us courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 

there is doubt as to the enforceability in england and wales in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts of civil liabilities solely based on the us federal securities laws the english courts will however treat any amount payable by us under us judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the english courts to enforce this debt against us the following criteria must be satisfied in order for the english court to enforce the debt created by the us judgment 

 operational and commercial risks 

our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other professional personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy the unexpected loss of services of any of our senior management team could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy competition for experienced professional personnel is intense and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected while we have plans for key management succession and longterm compensation plans designed to retain our senior employees if our succession plans do not operate effectively our business could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in and sourcing from foreign countries including 

 the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods tornadoes climate events or weather patterns and pandemic health events as well as manmade disasters including acts of terrorism military actions and cyberterrorism the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our risk solutions professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breaches power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of existing new or upgraded computer systems telecommunications and other related systems and operations in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations we could potentially lose access to key executives personnel or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses and security breaches we regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access in the future these types of incidents could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data in addition we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues additionally in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information and in the case of our hr solutions clients confidential information about our clients’ employees’ compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs loss of revenue and loss of clients the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

in many jurisdictions including in the european union and the us we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive our failure to adhere 

to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools conversely investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of inpoint repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process our competitors are developing competing databases and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions likewise we have invested significantly in our hr bpo business and platform innovations in software cloud computing or other technologies that alter how these services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments 

we are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets nevertheless for those efforts to produce meaningful value we are reliant on a number of other factors some of which our outside of our control for example our hr solutions segment has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the us manage their growing health care expenses in order for these exchanges to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances 

if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality broking risk management and hr solutions so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to satisfy these needs if a client is not satisfied with our services it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups andor trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work especially our actuarial services in our hr solutions business involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance similarly in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums in addition claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones   negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and regulatory compliance this damage to our reputation could affect 

the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely effecting on our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients andor employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

our risk solutions business collects premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are then remitted to the insureds similarly part of our hr solutions’ outsourcing business handles payroll processing and retirement and pension administration for several of our clients consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients and in the case of hr solutions their employees while payroll retirement plan funds or pension payments are being processed this function creates a risk of loss arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions or errors relating to transaction processing or other cybersecurity events or security breaches we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses the entry into new lines of business the integration of acquired businesses and the growth and development of these businesses 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms complete transactions and in the case of acquisitions successfully integrate them into our existing businesses if a proposed transaction is not consummated the time and resources spent in researching it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets 

from time to time either through acquisitions or internal development we enter lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business these new lines of business or new products and services present the company with additional risks particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed such risks include the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful the possibility that marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants external factors such as compliance with new or revised regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating primarily to our risk solutions segment 

results in our risk solutions segment may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

results in our risk solutions segment have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 

 in addition our increasing focus on new product offerings within the risk solutions space exposes us to additional risks as our business like the economy as a whole becomes more technology focused the speed at which our products are subject to challenge or becoming outdated is consistently increasing 

our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry 

in the past the attorney general of the state of new york brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community these actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future if they do so compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business 

risks relating primarily to our hr solutions segment 

we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the pending sale of our benefits administration and hr business process outsourcing bpo platform 

on february 9 2017 aon entered into a purchase agreement the “purchase agreement” with tempo acquisition llc an affiliate of the blackstone group lp the “buyer” to sell our benefits administration and hr business process outsourcing bpo platform the “divested business” in a transaction valued at approximately 43 billion plus additional consideration of up to 500 million based on future performance of the divested business the “transaction” the completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including among others i the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hartscott rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and ii the receipt of all approvals and the filing of all applicable filings under any relevant foreign jurisdictions that are required to be made or obtained as set forth in the purchase agreement although the transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2017 we can make no assurances that the transaction will close in the anticipated timeframe or at all any delay or failure to close the transaction as planned could have a negative impact on aon’s financial condition and results of operations to the extent that our current stock price reflects the assumption that the transaction will be consummated in the timeframe and manner currently anticipated any delay in the closing of the transaction or failure to close at all could result in a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares 

aon intends to allocate part of the proceeds from this transaction to increase its share repurchases and our board of directors has authorized an additional 5 billion under our stock repurchase program in support of this intent any delay or failure to close the transaction as planned could result in the failure of aon to increase its share repurchases as anticipated 

our directors executive officers and other employees have expended extensive time and effort and experienced significant distractions from their daytoday work during the pendency of the transaction including not pursuing other opportunities that might have otherwise been beneficial to us additionally we will have incurred significant thirdparty transaction costs in connection with the transaction if the transaction is not consummated we will have experienced such distractions and incurred such costs without realizing the expected benefit of the transaction which may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations 

even if the transaction is consummated as expected it carries inherent risks including the risk that aon will not earn the 500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction as well as risks connected with separating the divested business from aon because the divested business represent 19  of our gross revenues for the fiscal year 2016 our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected or may not be accretive to adjusted earnings per share as anticipated if we fail to effectively reduce our overhead costs to reflect the reduced scale of operations or fail to grow our other business as expected additionally the separation of the divested businesses from the rest of aon’s business will require significant resources which may disrupt operations or divert management’s attention from aon’s daytoday operations and efforts to grow our other businesses furthermore if we do not realize the benefits of the transaction as anticipated or if the divested business does not deliver the level of service to which our clients and partners are accustomed it could adversely affect our relationship with clients partners colleagues and other third parties 

the profitability of our outsourcing and consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

in our hr solutions segment our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to change in our business adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

most new outsourcing arrangements undergo an implementation process whereby our systems and processes are customized to match a client’s plans and programs the cost of this process is estimated by us and often partially funded by our clients if our actual implementation expense exceeds our estimate or if the ongoing service cost is greater than anticipated the client contract may be less profitable than expected 

even though outsourcing clients typically sign longterm contracts some of these contracts may be terminated at any time with or without cause by our client upon 90 to 360 days’ written notice our outsourcing clients are generally required to pay a termination fee however this amount may not be sufficient to offset the costs we incurred in connection with the implementation and system setup or fully compensate us for the profit we would have received if the contract had not been cancelled a client may choose to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress such as the business or financial condition of the client or general economic conditions when any of our engagements are terminated we may not be able to eliminate associated ongoing costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the impact on profitability any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors cost of living adjustment provisions the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions our profitability in providing hr bpo services is largely based on our ability to drive cost efficiencies during the term of our contracts for such services if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer our cost efficiencies may be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments our ability to secure new consulting engagements our ability to forecast demand for consulting services and consequently appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce employee attrition and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development 

we might not be able to achieve the cost savings required to sustain and increase our profit margins in our hr solutions business 

we provide our outsourcing services over long terms for variable or fixed fees that generally are less than our clients’ historical costs to provide for themselves the services we contract to deliver also clients’ demand for cost reductions may increase over the term of the agreement as a result we bear the risk of increases in the cost of delivering hr outsourcing services to our clients and our margins associated with particular contracts will depend on our ability to control our costs of performance under those contracts and meet our service commitments costeffectively over time some of our operating expenses will increase as we invest 

in additional infrastructure and implement new technologies to maintain our competitive position and meet our client service commitments we must anticipate and respond to the dynamics of our industry and business by using quality systems process management improved asset utilization and effective supplier management tools we must do this while continuing to grow our business so that our fixed costs are spread over an increasing revenue base if we are not able to achieve this our ability to sustain and increase profitability may be reduced 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors andor assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies selection or removal of investment managers the investment in different investment instruments and products and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciaryagency capacity albeit without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance third parties we recommend or select such as investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control regardless of the cause clients experiencing losses may assert claims against us and these claims may be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciaryagency duties or other alleged errors or omissions additionally clients experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may also leave us for our competitors 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

transfers of the class a ordinary shares may be subject to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk which would increase the cost of dealing in the class a ordinary shares 

stamp duty reserve taxes “sdrt” are imposed in the uk on certain transfers of chargeable securities which include shares in companies incorporated in the uk at a rate of 05 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 15 percent 

our class a ordinary shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of depository trust company “dtc” transfers of shares held in book entry form through dtc will not attract a charge to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk a transfer of the shares from within the dtc system out of dtc and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the dtc system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 05 percent of any consideration which is payable by the transferee of the shares any such duty must be paid and the relevant transfer document stamped by her majesty’s revenues and customs “hmrc” before the transfer can be registered in the books of aon if those shares are redeposited into dtc the redeposit will attract stamp duty or sdrt at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

we have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the dtc system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that sdrt may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository before the transfer can be registered in our books the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to sdrt which will be charged at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

following the decision of the first tier tribunal tax chamber in hsbc holdings plc the bank of new york mellon corporation v hmrc  2012 ukftt 163 tc and the announcement by hmrc that it will not seek to appeal the decision hmrc is no longer enforcing the charge to sdrt on the issue of shares into either eu or noneu depository receipt or clearance systems 

if the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of dtc then transactions in our securities may be disrupted 

the facilities of dtc are a widelyused mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the dtc system which include many large banks and brokerage firms we believe that prior to the redomestication approximately 99 of the outstanding shares of common stock of aon corporation were held within the dtc system the class a ordinary shares of aon plc are at present eligible for deposit and clearing within the dtc system in connection with the closing of the redomestication we entered into arrangements with dtc whereby we agreed to indemnify dtc for any stamp duty andor sdrt that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our class a ordinary shares in addition we have obtained a ruling from hmrc in respect of the stamp duty and sdrt consequences of the reorganization and sdrt has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of class a ordinary shares with the initial 

depository dtc will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the class a ordinary shares if dtc determines at any time that the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe the class a ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a us securities exchange or inclusion in the sp 500 and trading in the class a ordinary shares would be disrupted while we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the class a ordinary shares

 nongaap metrics 

in our discussion of operating results we sometimes refer to certain nongaap supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results this nongaap supplemental information should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

organic revenue growth 

we use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue growth is a nongaap measure that includes the impact of intersegment and intrasegment activity and excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes acquisitions divestitures transfers between business units fiduciary investment income reimbursable expenses and certain unusual items supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they may not make identical adjustments reconciliations of this nongaap measure organic revenue growth percentages to the reported commissions fees and other revenue growth percentages have been provided under the “review by segment” caption below 

adjusted operating margin 

we use adjusted operating margin as a nongaap measure of core operating performance of our risk solutions and hr solutions segments adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items including intangible asset amortization and certain pension settlements transaction costs and litigation settlements because we do not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance this supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported operating margins is as follows in millions except percentage data 







1 includes unallocated expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenue 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we also use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization and certain pension settlements transaction costs and litigation settlements along with related income taxes because we do not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings this supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

the effective tax rates used in the us gaap financial statements were 143  and 158  for the twelve months ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively excluded items are generally taxed at the effective tax rate however after adjusting the underlying annual tax rate to exclude the impact associated with certain noncash pension settlements in the second and fourth quarters of 2016 and expenses for legacy litigation in the second quarter of 2015 the adjusted effective tax rates for the full years 2016 and 2015 were 168  and 179  respectively 

reconciliations of this nongaap measure to the reported diluted earnings per share are as follows in millions except per share data 







free cash flow 

we use free cash flow defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance this supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto the use of this nongaap measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows in millions 



impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we conduct business in more than 120 countries and because of this foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the last year’s revenue expenses and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of 001 on diluted earnings per share during the year ended december 31 2016  currency fluctuations had unfavorable impacts of 038 and 011 on diluted earnings per share in the years ended 2015  and 2014  respectively when prior year results were translated at rates prevalent in those years currency fluctuations had unfavorable impacts of 001 041 and 011 on diluted earnings per share in the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively when prior year results were translated at rates prevalent in those years these translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations available cash reserves committed credit facilities and debt capacity available through public debt markets both short and longterm our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases pension contributions and shareholder dividends we believe that cash flows from operations and available debt financing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including principal and interest payments on debt obligations capital expenditures pension contributions and anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes as well as amounts restricted as to their use funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in fiduciary assets in the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding amount in fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds generally cannot be used for general corporate purposes and are not a source of liquidity 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased 19 million  to 721 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  during 2016  cash flow from operating activities increased   317 million  to 23 billion  additional sources of funds in 2016  included proceeds from the sale of businesses of 107 million  and issuances of debt net of repayments  of 522 million  the primary uses of funds in 2016  included share repurchases of 13 billion  acquisitions of businesses of 879 million  dividends to shareholders of 345 million  and capital expenditures of 222 million  

to manage unforeseen situations we have committed credit lines of approximately 13 billion  and we endeavor to manage our obligations to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings at december 31 2016  we had no borrowings on these credit lines 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2016   increased   317 million  in 2015  or 16  to 23 billion  this amount represents net income reported by the company as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses financial instruments and foreign exchange and our noncash expenses which include sharebased compensation depreciation and amortization as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and collection of receivables the increase from the prior year was primarily driven by net income as adjusted for noncash charges and reductions in pension contributions 

pension contributions were 123 million  during 2016  compared to 194 million  during 2015  in 2017  we expect to contribute approximately 185 million  to our pension plans with the majority attributable to nonus pension plans which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates 

we expect cash generated by operations for 2016  to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations finance capital expenditures purchases shares under our share repurchase program and pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows we have committed credit facilities of approximately 13 billion  all of which was available at december 31 2016  and can access these facilities on a same day or next day basis additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed

cash and shortterm investments 

at december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 721 million  a decrease  of 19 million  from december 31 2015  primarily related to share repurchases of 13 billion  payments for the acquisition of businesses of 879 million  cash dividends of 345 million  capital expenditures of 222 million  and cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans of 123 million  partially offset by 23 billion  in cash flow from operating activities the net issuances of debt of 522 million  and proceeds for the sale of businesses of 107 million  of the total balance as of december 31 2016  82 million  was restricted as to its use which was comprised of 53 million  of operating funds in the uk as required by the fca and 29 million  held as collateral for various business purposes at december 31 2016  19 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the us and overdrawn cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 12 billion  were held in other countries due to differences in tax rates the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the us could have an unfavorable tax impact we maintain multicurrency cash pools with thirdparty banks in which various aon entities participate individual aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall balance does not fall below zero at december 31 2016  and 2015  nonus cash balances of one or more entities were negative however the overall balance was positive 

at december 31 2015  our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 740 million  a decrease of 28 million from december 31 2014  primarily related to share repurchases of 16 billion and dividends to shareholders of 323 million partially offset by 20 billion in cash flow from operating activities and the net issuances of debt of 253 million of the total balance as of december 31 2015  105 million was restricted as to its use which was comprised of 65 million of operating funds in the uk as required by the fca and 40 million held as collateral for various business purposes at 

december 31 2015  26 billion of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the us and overdrawn cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 19 billion were held in other countries due to differences in tax rates the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the us could have an unfavorable tax impact 

in our capacity as an insurance broker or agent we collect premiums from insureds and after deducting our commission remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter we also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds which are then returned to the insureds unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity in addition some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf the levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums claims and refunds make payments to underwriters and insureds collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf and from the impact of foreign currency movements fiduciary assets because of their nature are generally invested in very liquid securities with highlyrated creditworthy financial institutions in our consolidated statements of financial position the amount we report for fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal our fiduciary assets included cash and shortterm investments of 38 billion  and 34 billion at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively and fiduciary receivables of 57 billion  and 65 billion at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively while we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes 

as disclosed in note 13 “fair value measurements and financial instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds these money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions we are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments 

as of december 31 2016  our investments in money market funds had a fair value of 14 billion  and are reported as shortterm investments or fiduciary assets in the consolidated statements of financial position depending on their nature and initial maturity 

the following table summarizes our fiduciary assets and nonfiduciary cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2016  in millions 



share repurchase program 

in april 2012 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the “2012 share repurchase program” under which up to 50 billion of class a ordinary shares may be repurchased in november 2014 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program “the 2014 share repurchase program” and together with the 2012 share repurchase program the “share repurchase programs” pursuant to which an additional 50 billion  may be repurchased in addition to the 50 billion of class a ordinary shares authorized under the 2012 share repurchase program in february 2017 the board of directors authorized a 50 billion increase to the then existing remaining authorization under its share repurchase program under each share repurchase program shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions funded from available capital 

during 2016  the company repurchased 122 million shares at an average price per share of 10266  for a total cost of 13 billion  the company recorded an additional 6 million of costs associated with the repurchase to retained earnings during 2016 during 2015  the company repurchased 160 million shares at an average price per share of 9704 for a total cost of 16 billion in august 2015 the 50 billion of class a ordinary shares authorized under the 2012 share repurchase program was exhausted 

at december 31 2016 and without giving effect to the increase in february 2017 the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the 2014 share repurchase program was 28 billion  under the repurchase programs the company has repurchased a total of 902 million  shares for an aggregate cost of 72 billion  through december 31 2016 

for information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2016  see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” as previously described 

dividends 

during 2016  2015  and 2014  we paid dividends on our class a ordinary shares of 345 million  323 million  and 273 million  respectively dividends paid per class a ordinary share were 129  115  and 092  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

distributable reserves 

as a uk incorporated company we are required under uk law to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the uk parent company distributable reserves are not linked to a us gaap reported amount eg retained earnings as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had distributable reserves in excess of 16 billion  and 21 billion  respectively we believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund share repurchases and shareholder dividends for the foreseeable future 

borrowings 

total debt at december 31 2016  was 62 billion  which represents an increase  of 505 million  compared to december 31 2015  this increase  is primarily due to issuances of debt net of repayments  of 522 million  including a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of 279 million compared to december 31 2015  

on may 27 2016 500 million  of 3125  senior notes due may 2016 issued by aon corporation matured and were repaid in full 

on march 1 2016 aon plc issued 750 million  of 3875  senior notes due december 2025 the company used the proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2016  we had two  committed credit facilities outstanding our 400 million  us credit facility expiring in march 2017 the “2017 facility” and our 900 million  multicurrency us credit facility originally expiring in february 2020 effective february 2 2016 the 900 million multicurrency us credit facility terms were extended for one year and will now expire on february 2 2021 the “2021 facility” each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities includes customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly we intend to let the 2017 facility expire but may obtain additional committed credit facilities in the future at december 31 2016  we did not have borrowings under either the 2017 facility or the 2021 facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended december 31 2016  

our total debttoebitda ratio at december 31 2016  and 2015  is calculated as follows in millions except ratio 



we use ebitda as defined by our financial covenants as a nongaap measure this supplemental information related to ebitda represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

shelf registration statement 

on september 3 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of debt securities preference shares class a ordinary shares and convertible securities among other securities our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand market conditions and other factors 

rating agency ratings 

the major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at february 23 2017  appear in the table below 



a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to debt capital reduce our financial flexibility increase our commercial paper interest rates or restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether andor impact future pension contribution requirements 

letters of credit and other guarantees 

we have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit “locs” we had total locs outstanding of approximately 90 million  at december 31 2016  compared to 58 million  at december 31 2015  these locs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our us and canadian nonqualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program we also have obtained locs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries 

we have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies the maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately 95 million  at december 31 2016  compared to 104 million  at december 31 2015  

other liquidity matters 

we do not have exposure related to off balance sheet arrangements our cash flows from operations borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties see item 1 “information concerning forwardlooking statements” and item 1a “risk factors” 

contractual obligations 

summarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  in millions 



pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa and other regulations and minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed to with or required by the uk pension plan trustees nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments we may make additional discretionary contributions 

in 2013 our principal uk subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the uk plans to contribute an average of 11 million per year to that pension plan for the next three years we are currently negotiating the 2016 valuation which will determine the required cash contributions for the next three years the trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our uk subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined windingup deficit as of december 31 2016  the estimated windingup deficit was £175 million 215 million at december 31 2016  exchange rates the trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreedupon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the windingup deficit be paid 

purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered and the timing of the transactions most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts purchase obligations exclude 278 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the periods when potential cash settlements will be made 

financial condition 

at december 31 2016  our net assets were 55 billion  representing total assets minus total liabilities a decrease  from 61 billion  as revised for december 31 2015  see note 1 “basis of presentation  revision of previously issued financial statements” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the revision of previously issued financial statements the decrease  was due primarily to share repurchases of 13 billion  dividends to shareholders of 345 million  and an increase  in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 489 million  related primarily to foreign currency translation partially offset by net income of 14 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  working capital increased  by 171 million  from 480 million  at december 31 2015  to 651 million  at december 31 2016  

accumulated other comprehensive loss increased   489 million  at december 31 2016  as compared to december 31 2015  which was primarily driven by negative  net foreign currency translation adjustments of 493 million  which are attributable to the strengthening  of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies a decrease  of 16 million  in net postretirement benefit obligations and net financial instrument losses  of 12 million  

review by segment 

overview 

we serve clients through the following segments 

 

 risk solutions 



the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units and is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values during 2016  pricing was modestly negative on average globally and we still consider this a “soft market” in a soft market premium rates flatten or decrease along with commission revenues due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds 

continuing through 2016  we faced difficult conditions as a result of continued weakness in the global economy and the repricing of credit risk weak economic conditions in many markets around the globe have reduced our customers’ demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products which have had a negative impact on our operational results 

risk solutions generated approximately 64  of our consolidated total revenues in 2016  revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients’ policy renewals the net effect of new and lost business the timing of services provided to our clients and the income we earn on investments which is heavily influenced by shortterm interest rates 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms as well as with individual brokers agents and direct writers of insurance coverage specifically we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises professional groups insurance companies governments health care providers and nonprofit groups among others provide affinity products for professional liability life disability income and personal lines for individuals associations and businesses provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services capital raising contingent capital financing insurancelinked securitizations and derivative applications provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients provide risk consulting actuarial loss prevention and administrative services to businesses and consumers and manage captive insurance companies

unallocated income and expense 

a reconciliation of our operating income to income before income taxes is as follows in millions 



unallocated operating expense includes corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments net unallocated expenses increased   44 million  to 238 million  in 2016  compared to 194 million  in 2015  due primarily to 50 million of noncash expenses related to certain pension settlements 

interest income interest expense and other income and its components are discussed in management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations  review of consolidated results 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with us gaap to prepare these financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 

in accordance with our policies we regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to those concerning revenue recognition pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes and base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we use to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

risk solutions segment revenues primarily include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable we consider revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when all of the following four conditions are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 3 delivery or performance has occurred and 4 collectability is reasonably assured for brokerage commissions revenue is typically recognized at the completion of the placement process assuming all four criteria required to recognize revenue have been met the placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data 

hr solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly project or fixedfee basis revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus arrangements are recognized as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met revenues from fixedfee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportionalperformance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement revenues from healthcare exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants net of a reserve for estimated cancellations assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met reimbursements received for outofpocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues our outsourcing contracts typically have threetofive year terms for benefits services and fivetoten year terms for human resources business process outsourcing “hr bpo” services we recognize revenues as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met we may also receive implementation fees from clients either upfront or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant lump sum implementation fees received from a client are typically deferred and recognized ratably over the ongoing contract services period if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract a loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date 

in connection with our longterm outsourcing service agreements highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on our systems and operating processes for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting specific incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue 

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada and are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our us uk netherlands and canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted 

beginning for 2016 expense we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows in 2015 and prior years we estimated these components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost by 

applying a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the us the netherlands canada and uk plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2016  our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2017  amortization of loss by country millions except amortization period 



the unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2016  was 6 million  19 million  and 6 million  in the us uk and other plans respectively 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2016  the marketrelated value of assets was 18 billion  we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2016  the fair value of plan assets was 17 billion  

our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix as of december 31 2016  



in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we survey multiple thirdparty financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the investment policy for uk and nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and nonus category our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan further target allocations are subject to change 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2016  in millions 



 holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our estimated 2017  pension expense in millions 



holding other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a 25 basis point increase and decrease in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2017  pension expense in millions 



estimated future contributions 

we estimate contributions of approximately 185 million  to our pension plans in 2017  as compared with 123 million  in 2016  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customer related and contract based or technology and other 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we also test the acquired tradenames which also are not amortized for impairment we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others no events occurred during 2016  that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a “component” a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components is a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

the goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value including goodwill of the corresponding reporting unit if the “more likely than not” threshold is not met then the goodwill impairment test becomes a twostep analysis step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step two step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weightedaverage cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry based on tests performed in both 2016  and 2015  there was no indication of goodwill impairment and no further testing was required 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2016  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

restricted share units “rsus” are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

performance share awards “psas” are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation cost is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest performancebased sharebased payment award plan is the leadership performance plan “lpp” which has a threeyear performance period the 2014 to 2016 performance period ended on december 31 2016 the 2013 to 2015 performance period ended on december 31 2015 and the 2012 to 2014 performance period ended on december 31 2014 the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2015 to 2017 and 2016 to 2018 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2016  expense by approximately 81 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 81 million as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in this assessment significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for permanently reinvested earnings of certain subsidiaries additional income taxes could be recorded or incurred if we change our investment strategy relating to these subsidiaries which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

we base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars and euros but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2016  we have hedged approximately 45 of our uk subsidiaries’ expected exposures to both us dollar and euro transactions for the years ending december 31 2017  and 2018  respectively we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and shortterm assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 32 million  and 18 million  at december 31 2017  and 2018  respectively 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the north america continental europe and the asia pacific region a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 41 million  to both 2017  and 2018  pretax income respectively a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 41 million  to both 2017  and 2018  pretax income respectively 

we have longterm debt outstanding with a fair market value of 63 billion  and 54 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively this fair value was greater than  the carrying value by 04 billion  at december 31 2016  and 02 billion   greater than  the carrying value at december 31 2015  a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 8  or an increase of 9  respectively at december 31 2016  

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

 nongaap metrics 

in our discussion of operating results we sometimes refer to certain nongaap supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results this nongaap supplemental information should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

organic revenue growth 

we use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue growth is a nongaap measure that includes the impact of intersegment and intrasegment activity and excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes acquisitions divestitures transfers between business units fiduciary investment income reimbursable expenses and certain unusual items supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they may not make identical adjustments reconciliations of this nongaap measure organic revenue growth percentages to the reported commissions fees and other revenue growth percentages have been provided under the “review by segment” caption below 

adjusted operating margin 

we use adjusted operating margin as a nongaap measure of core operating performance of our risk solutions and hr solutions segments adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items including intangible asset amortization and certain pension settlements transaction costs and litigation settlements because we do not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance this supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported operating margins is as follows in millions except percentage data 







1 includes unallocated expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenue 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we also use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization and certain pension settlements transaction costs and litigation settlements along with related income taxes because we do not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings this supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

the effective tax rates used in the us gaap financial statements were 143  and 158  for the twelve months ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively excluded items are generally taxed at the effective tax rate however after adjusting the underlying annual tax rate to exclude the impact associated with certain noncash pension settlements in the second and fourth quarters of 2016 and expenses for legacy litigation in the second quarter of 2015 the adjusted effective tax rates for the full years 2016 and 2015 were 168  and 179  respectively 

reconciliations of this nongaap measure to the reported diluted earnings per share are as follows in millions except per share data 







free cash flow 

we use free cash flow defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance this supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto the use of this nongaap measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows in millions 



impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we conduct business in more than 120 countries and because of this foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the last year’s revenue expenses and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign currency exchange rates currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of 001 on diluted earnings per share during the year ended december 31 2016  currency fluctuations had unfavorable impacts of 038 and 011 on diluted earnings per share in the years ended 2015  and 2014  respectively when prior year results were translated at rates prevalent in those years currency fluctuations had unfavorable impacts of 001 041 and 011 on diluted earnings per share in the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively when prior year results were translated at rates prevalent in those years these translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations available cash reserves committed credit facilities and debt capacity available through public debt markets both short and longterm our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases pension contributions and shareholder dividends we believe that cash flows from operations and available debt financing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including principal and interest payments on debt obligations capital expenditures pension contributions and anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes as well as amounts restricted as to their use funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in fiduciary assets in the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding amount in fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds generally cannot be used for general corporate purposes and are not a source of liquidity 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased 19 million  to 721 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  during 2016  cash flow from operating activities increased   317 million  to 23 billion  additional sources of funds in 2016  included proceeds from the sale of businesses of 107 million  and issuances of debt net of repayments  of 522 million  the primary uses of funds in 2016  included share repurchases of 13 billion  acquisitions of businesses of 879 million  dividends to shareholders of 345 million  and capital expenditures of 222 million  

to manage unforeseen situations we have committed credit lines of approximately 13 billion  and we endeavor to manage our obligations to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings at december 31 2016  we had no borrowings on these credit lines 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2016   increased   317 million  in 2015  or 16  to 23 billion  this amount represents net income reported by the company as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses financial instruments and foreign exchange and our noncash expenses which include sharebased compensation depreciation and amortization as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and collection of receivables the increase from the prior year was primarily driven by net income as adjusted for noncash charges and reductions in pension contributions 

pension contributions were 123 million  during 2016  compared to 194 million  during 2015  in 2017  we expect to contribute approximately 185 million  to our pension plans with the majority attributable to nonus pension plans which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates 

we expect cash generated by operations for 2016  to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations finance capital expenditures purchases shares under our share repurchase program and pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows we have committed credit facilities of approximately 13 billion  all of which was available at december 31 2016  and can access these facilities on a same day or next day basis additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed 

investing activities 

cash used for  investing activities in 2016  was 954 million  the primary drivers of the cash used for  investing activities were 879 million  for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired 222 million  for capital expenditures and 21 million  of net purchases of longterm investments partially offset by 107 million  of sale of businesses and 61 million  of net sales  of shortterm investments

cash and shortterm investments 

at december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 721 million  a decrease  of 19 million  from december 31 2015  primarily related to share repurchases of 13 billion  payments for the acquisition of businesses of 879 million  cash dividends of 345 million  capital expenditures of 222 million  and cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans of 123 million  partially offset by 23 billion  in cash flow from operating activities the net issuances of debt of 522 million  and proceeds for the sale of businesses of 107 million  of the total balance as of december 31 2016  82 million  was restricted as to its use which was comprised of 53 million  of operating funds in the uk as required by the fca and 29 million  held as collateral for various business purposes at december 31 2016  19 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the us and overdrawn cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 12 billion  were held in other countries due to differences in tax rates the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the us could have an unfavorable tax impact we maintain multicurrency cash pools with thirdparty banks in which various aon entities participate individual aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall balance does not fall below zero at december 31 2016  and 2015  nonus cash balances of one or more entities were negative however the overall balance was positive 

at december 31 2015  our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 740 million  a decrease of 28 million from december 31 2014  primarily related to share repurchases of 16 billion and dividends to shareholders of 323 million partially offset by 20 billion in cash flow from operating activities and the net issuances of debt of 253 million of the total balance as of december 31 2015  105 million was restricted as to its use which was comprised of 65 million of operating funds in the uk as required by the fca and 40 million held as collateral for various business purposes at 

december 31 2015  26 billion of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held in the us and overdrawn cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 19 billion were held in other countries due to differences in tax rates the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the us could have an unfavorable tax impact 

in our capacity as an insurance broker or agent we collect premiums from insureds and after deducting our commission remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter we also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds which are then returned to the insureds unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity in addition some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf the levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums claims and refunds make payments to underwriters and insureds collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf and from the impact of foreign currency movements fiduciary assets because of their nature are generally invested in very liquid securities with highlyrated creditworthy financial institutions in our consolidated statements of financial position the amount we report for fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal our fiduciary assets included cash and shortterm investments of 38 billion  and 34 billion at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively and fiduciary receivables of 57 billion  and 65 billion at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively while we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments the cash and investments cannot be used for general corporate purposes 

as disclosed in note 13 “fair value measurements and financial instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds these money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions we are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments 

as of december 31 2016  our investments in money market funds had a fair value of 14 billion  and are reported as shortterm investments or fiduciary assets in the consolidated statements of financial position depending on their nature and initial maturity 

the following table summarizes our fiduciary assets and nonfiduciary cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2016  in millions 



share repurchase program 

in april 2012 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the “2012 share repurchase program” under which up to 50 billion of class a ordinary shares may be repurchased in november 2014 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program “the 2014 share repurchase program” and together with the 2012 share repurchase program the “share repurchase programs” pursuant to which an additional 50 billion  may be repurchased in addition to the 50 billion of class a ordinary shares authorized under the 2012 share repurchase program in february 2017 the board of directors authorized a 50 billion increase to the then existing remaining authorization under its share repurchase program under each share repurchase program shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions funded from available capital 

during 2016  the company repurchased 122 million shares at an average price per share of 10266  for a total cost of 13 billion  the company recorded an additional 6 million of costs associated with the repurchase to retained earnings during 2016 during 2015  the company repurchased 160 million shares at an average price per share of 9704 for a total cost of 16 billion in august 2015 the 50 billion of class a ordinary shares authorized under the 2012 share repurchase program was exhausted 

at december 31 2016 and without giving effect to the increase in february 2017 the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the 2014 share repurchase program was 28 billion  under the repurchase programs the company has repurchased a total of 902 million  shares for an aggregate cost of 72 billion  through december 31 2016 

for information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2016  see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” as previously described 

dividends 

during 2016  2015  and 2014  we paid dividends on our class a ordinary shares of 345 million  323 million  and 273 million  respectively dividends paid per class a ordinary share were 129  115  and 092  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

distributable reserves 

as a uk incorporated company we are required under uk law to have available “distributable reserves” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the uk parent company distributable reserves are not linked to a us gaap reported amount eg retained earnings as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had distributable reserves in excess of 16 billion  and 21 billion  respectively we believe that we will have sufficient distributable reserves to fund share repurchases and shareholder dividends for the foreseeable future 

borrowings 

total debt at december 31 2016  was 62 billion  which represents an increase  of 505 million  compared to december 31 2015  this increase  is primarily due to issuances of debt net of repayments  of 522 million  including a net increase in commercial paper outstanding of 279 million compared to december 31 2015  

on may 27 2016 500 million  of 3125  senior notes due may 2016 issued by aon corporation matured and were repaid in full 

on march 1 2016 aon plc issued 750 million  of 3875  senior notes due december 2025 the company used the proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2016  we had two  committed credit facilities outstanding our 400 million  us credit facility expiring in march 2017 the “2017 facility” and our 900 million  multicurrency us credit facility originally expiring in february 2020 effective february 2 2016 the 900 million multicurrency us credit facility terms were extended for one year and will now expire on february 2 2021 the “2021 facility” each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities includes customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly we intend to let the 2017 facility expire but may obtain additional committed credit facilities in the future at december 31 2016  we did not have borrowings under either the 2017 facility or the 2021 facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the twelve months ended december 31 2016  

our total debttoebitda ratio at december 31 2016  and 2015  is calculated as follows in millions except ratio 



we use ebitda as defined by our financial covenants as a nongaap measure this supplemental information related to ebitda represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

shelf registration statement 

on september 3 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of debt securities preference shares class a ordinary shares and convertible securities among other securities our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand market conditions and other factors 

rating agency ratings 

the major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at february 23 2017  appear in the table below 



a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to debt capital reduce our financial flexibility increase our commercial paper interest rates or restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether andor impact future pension contribution requirements 

letters of credit and other guarantees 

we have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit “locs” we had total locs outstanding of approximately 90 million  at december 31 2016  compared to 58 million  at december 31 2015  these locs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our us and canadian nonqualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program we also have obtained locs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries 

we have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies the maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately 95 million  at december 31 2016  compared to 104 million  at december 31 2015  

other liquidity matters 

we do not have exposure related to off balance sheet arrangements our cash flows from operations borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties see item 1 “information concerning forwardlooking statements” and item 1a “risk factors” 

contractual obligations 

summarized in the table below are our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  in millions 



pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa and other regulations and minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed to with or required by the uk pension plan trustees nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments we may make additional discretionary contributions 

in 2013 our principal uk subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the uk plans to contribute an average of 11 million per year to that pension plan for the next three years we are currently negotiating the 2016 valuation which will determine the required cash contributions for the next three years the trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our uk subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined windingup deficit as of december 31 2016  the estimated windingup deficit was £175 million 215 million at december 31 2016  exchange rates the trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreedupon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested the windingup deficit be paid 

purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered and the timing of the transactions most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts purchase obligations exclude 278 million  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to our inability to reasonably estimate the periods when potential cash settlements will be made 

financial condition 

at december 31 2016  our net assets were 55 billion  representing total assets minus total liabilities a decrease  from 61 billion  as revised for december 31 2015  see note 1 “basis of presentation  revision of previously issued financial statements” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the revision of previously issued financial statements the decrease  was due primarily to share repurchases of 13 billion  dividends to shareholders of 345 million  and an increase  in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 489 million  related primarily to foreign currency translation partially offset by net income of 14 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  working capital increased  by 171 million  from 480 million  at december 31 2015  to 651 million  at december 31 2016  

accumulated other comprehensive loss increased   489 million  at december 31 2016  as compared to december 31 2015  which was primarily driven by negative  net foreign currency translation adjustments of 493 million  which are attributable to the strengthening  of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies a decrease  of 16 million  in net postretirement benefit obligations and net financial instrument losses  of 12 million  

review by segment 

overview 

we serve clients through the following segments 

 

 risk solutions 



the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units and is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values during 2016  pricing was modestly negative on average globally and we still consider this a “soft market” in a soft market premium rates flatten or decrease along with commission revenues due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds 

continuing through 2016  we faced difficult conditions as a result of continued weakness in the global economy and the repricing of credit risk weak economic conditions in many markets around the globe have reduced our customers’ demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products which have had a negative impact on our operational results 

risk solutions generated approximately 64  of our consolidated total revenues in 2016  revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients’ policy renewals the net effect of new and lost business the timing of services provided to our clients and the income we earn on investments which is heavily influenced by shortterm interest rates 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms as well as with individual brokers agents and direct writers of insurance coverage specifically we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises professional groups insurance companies governments health care providers and nonprofit groups among others provide affinity products for professional liability life disability income and personal lines for individuals associations and businesses provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services capital raising contingent capital financing insurancelinked securitizations and derivative applications provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients provide risk consulting actuarial loss prevention and administrative services to businesses and consumers and manage captive insurance companies

reinsurance  commissions fees and other revenue was flat in 2016  as compared to 2015 as 1  organic revenue growth was offset by a 1  impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates organic revenue growth for 2016  was driven by net new business growth in treaty placements globally and modest growth in facultative placements partially offset by an unfavorable market impact in treaty and a decline in capital markets transactions and advisory business 

operating income 

operating income increased   81 million  or 5  from 2015  to 16 billion  in 2016  in 2016  operating income margins in this segment were 212  an increase of 90  basis points from 203  in 2015  the increase in operating margin was driven by solid organic revenue growth and returns on investments in data and analytics across the portfolio as well as a decrease in expense related to certain legacy litigation in the prior year 

hr solutions

unallocated income and expense 

a reconciliation of our operating income to income before income taxes is as follows in millions 



unallocated operating expense includes corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments net unallocated expenses increased   44 million  to 238 million  in 2016  compared to 194 million  in 2015  due primarily to 50 million of noncash expenses related to certain pension settlements 

interest income interest expense and other income and its components are discussed in management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations  review of consolidated results 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with us gaap to prepare these financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 

in accordance with our policies we regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to those concerning revenue recognition pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes and base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we use to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

risk solutions segment revenues primarily include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable we consider revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when all of the following four conditions are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 3 delivery or performance has occurred and 4 collectability is reasonably assured for brokerage commissions revenue is typically recognized at the completion of the placement process assuming all four criteria required to recognize revenue have been met the placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data 

hr solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly project or fixedfee basis revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus arrangements are recognized as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met revenues from fixedfee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportionalperformance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement revenues from healthcare exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants net of a reserve for estimated cancellations assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met reimbursements received for outofpocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues our outsourcing contracts typically have threetofive year terms for benefits services and fivetoten year terms for human resources business process outsourcing “hr bpo” services we recognize revenues as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met we may also receive implementation fees from clients either upfront or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant lump sum implementation fees received from a client are typically deferred and recognized ratably over the ongoing contract services period if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract a loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date 

in connection with our longterm outsourcing service agreements highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on our systems and operating processes for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting specific incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue 

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada and are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our us uk netherlands and canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted 

beginning for 2016 expense we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows in 2015 and prior years we estimated these components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost by 

applying a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the us the netherlands canada and uk plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2016  our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2017  amortization of loss by country millions except amortization period 



the unrecognized prior service cost credit at december 31 2016  was 6 million  19 million  and 6 million  in the us uk and other plans respectively 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2016  the marketrelated value of assets was 18 billion  we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2016  the fair value of plan assets was 17 billion  

our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix as of december 31 2016  



in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we survey multiple thirdparty financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the investment policy for uk and nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and nonus category our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan further target allocations are subject to change 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense

estimated future contributions 

we estimate contributions of approximately 185 million  to our pension plans in 2017  as compared with 123 million  in 2016  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customer related and contract based or technology and other 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we also test the acquired tradenames which also are not amortized for impairment we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others no events occurred during 2016  that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a “component” a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components is a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

the goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value including goodwill of the corresponding reporting unit if the “more likely than not” threshold is not met then the goodwill impairment test becomes a twostep analysis step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step two step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weightedaverage cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry based on tests performed in both 2016  and 2015  there was no indication of goodwill impairment and no further testing was required 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2016  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

restricted share units “rsus” are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

performance share awards “psas” are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation cost is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest performancebased sharebased payment award plan is the leadership performance plan “lpp” which has a threeyear performance period the 2014 to 2016 performance period ended on december 31 2016 the 2013 to 2015 performance period ended on december 31 2015 and the 2012 to 2014 performance period ended on december 31 2014 the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2015 to 2017 and 2016 to 2018 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2016  expense by approximately 81 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 81 million as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in this assessment significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for permanently reinvested earnings of certain subsidiaries additional income taxes could be recorded or incurred if we change our investment strategy relating to these subsidiaries which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

we base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting principles and practices” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars and euros but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2016  we have hedged approximately 45 of our uk subsidiaries’ expected exposures to both us dollar and euro transactions for the years ending december 31 2017  and 2018  respectively we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and shortterm assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 32 million  and 18 million  at december 31 2017  and 2018  respectively 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the north america continental europe and the asia pacific region a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 41 million  to both 2017  and 2018  pretax income respectively a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 41 million  to both 2017  and 2018  pretax income respectively 

we have longterm debt outstanding with a fair market value of 63 billion  and 54 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively this fair value was greater than  the carrying value by 04 billion  at december 31 2016  and 02 billion   greater than  the carrying value at december 31 2015  a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 8  or an increase of 9  respectively at december 31 2016  

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

notes to consolidated financial statements 

1 basis of presentation 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of aon plc and all of its controlled subsidiaries “aon” or the “company” all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated the consolidated financial statements include in the opinion of management all adjustments necessary to present fairly the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented 

revision of previously issued financial statements 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 the company identified errors related to the recognition of revenue for certain brokerage fee arrangements specifically the consideration for certain arrangements covering multiple insurance placements was not appropriately allocated to each individual placement 

based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletins 99 and 108 the company concluded that these errors were immaterial individually and in the aggregate to the consolidated statements of financial position consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows as presented in the company’s quarterly and annual financial statements previously filed in the company’s quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k while aon concluded that the errors were immaterial to each of the prior reporting periods affected the company further concluded that correcting the errors cumulatively in fiscal year 2016 would materially misstate the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2016 as a result amendment of such reports is not required 

in preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 the company made appropriate revisions to its financial statements for historical periods such changes are reflected for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 included in these financial statements and will also be reflected in the historical periods included in the company’s subsequent quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements 

 the impact to the consolidated statements of financial position was a decrease of 170 million  to receivables net an increase of 66 million  to deferred tax assets and a decrease of 104 million  to retained earnings in all periods presented the impact to the full year consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of comprehensive income was de minimis in all periods presented and therefore remains unchanged there was no impact to the full year cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

the impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows previously filed in unaudited quarterly reports on form 10q is as follows in millions 



 refer to note 17 “quarterly financial data” for the impact to the company’s condensed consolidated statements of income previously filed in quarterly reports on form 10q 

reclassification 

certain amounts in prior years’ consolidated financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation 

in prior periods cash outflows from restructuring activities were shown as a separate line item within cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows beginning in 2016 these amounts are disclosed as a component of the change in other assets and liabilities within cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash outflows for restructuring reserves were 31 million  at december 31 2015 and 83 million  at december 31 2014 

use of estimates 

the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of reserves and expenses these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgments management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors including the current economic environment management believes its estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available aon adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate illiquid credit markets volatile equity markets and foreign currency exchange rate movements increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions as future events and their effects cannot be determined among other factors with precision actual results could differ significantly from these estimates changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment would if applicable be reflected in the financial statements in future periods 

2 summary of significant accounting principles and practices 

revenue recognition 

risk solutions segment revenues primarily include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable the company considers revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when all of the following four conditions are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 3 delivery or performance has occurred and 4 collectability is reasonably assured for brokerage commissions revenue is typically recognized at the completion of the placement process assuming all four criteria required to recognize revenue have been met the placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data 

hr solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly project or fixedfee basis revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus arrangements are recognized as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met revenues from fixedfee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportionalperformance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement revenues from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants net of a reserve for estimated cancellations assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met reimbursements received for outofpocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues the company’s outsourcing contracts typically have three to five  year terms for both benefits services and human resources business process outsourcing “hr bpo” services the company recognizes revenues as services are performed assuming all criteria to recognize revenue have been met the company may also receive implementation fees from clients either upfront or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant lump sum implementation fees received from a client are typically deferred and recognized ratably over the ongoing contract service period if a client terminates an outsourcing service arrangement prior to the end of the contract a loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date 

in connection with the company’s longterm outsourcing service agreements highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the company’s systems and operating processes qualifying costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue 

sharebased compensation costs 

sharebased payments to employees including grants of restricted share units and performance share awards are measured based on estimated grant date fair value the company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to ultimately vest forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the company records net period cost relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations that include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets inflation rates mortality rates compensation increases and turnover rates the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and modifies these assumptions based on current rates and trends the effects of gains losses and prior service costs and credits are amortized over future service periods or future estimated lives if the plans are frozen the funded status of each plan calculated as the fair 

value of plan assets less the benefit obligation is reflected in the company’s consolidated statements of financial position using a december 31 measurement date 

net income per share 

basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weightedaverage number of ordinary shares outstanding including participating securities which consist of unvested share awards with nonforfeitable rights to dividends diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weightedaverage number of ordinary shares outstanding which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable ordinary shares excluding those that are considered participating securities including certain contingently issuable shares the diluted earnings per share calculation reflects the more dilutive effect of either 1 the twoclass method that assumes that the participating securities have not been exercised or 2 the treasury stock method 

potentially issuable shares are not included in the computation of diluted income per share if their inclusion would be antidilutive 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less shortterm investments consist of money market funds the estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments approximates their carrying values 

at december 31 2016  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 721 million  compared to 740 million  at december 31 2015  of the total balance 82 million  and 105 million  was restricted as to its use at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively included within the december 31 2016  and 2015  balances respectively were £433 million   532 million  at december 31 2016  exchanges rates and £433 million   646 million  at december 31 2015  exchange rates of operating funds required to be held by the company in the uk by the financial conduct authority a ukbased regulator which were included in shortterm investments in addition cash and cash equivalents included restricted balances of 29 million  and 40 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

fiduciary assets and liabilities 

in its capacity as an insurance agent and broker aon collects premiums from insureds and after deducting its commission remits the premiums to the respective insurers aon also collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers are recorded as fiduciary assets in the company’s consolidated statements of financial position unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary capacity and the obligation to remit these funds is recorded as fiduciary liabilities in the company’s consolidated statements of financial position some of the company’s outsourcing agreements also require it to hold funds to pay certain obligations on behalf of clients these funds are also recorded as fiduciary assets with the related obligation recorded as fiduciary liabilities in the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

aon maintained premium trust balances for premiums collected from insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies of 38 billion  and 34 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively these funds and a corresponding liability are included in fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities respectively in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to receivables is based on a combination of factors including evaluation of historical writeoffs aging of balances and other qualitative and quantitative analyses receivables net included an allowance for doubtful accounts of 58 million  at both december 31 2016  and 2015  

fixed assets 

fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation included in this category is internal use software which is software that is acquired internally developed or modified solely to meet internal needs with no plan to market externally costs related to directly obtaining developing or upgrading internal use software are capitalized depreciation and amortization 

are computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which are generally as follows 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets in the acquisition of a business goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are one reporting level below the operating segment upon disposition of a business entity goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it was included goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level the company initially performs a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill balance is impaired if such a determination is made then the company will perform a twostep quantitative analysis first the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit’s fair value to determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill any resulting difference will be a charge to other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which the determination is made fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and market prices of comparable businesses 

intangible assets are primarily comprised of tradenames and customerrelated contractbased and technology assets tradenames are not amortized when such assets have been determined to have indefinite useful lives and are tested at least annually for impairments using an analysis of expected future cash flows interim impairment testing may be performed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable customer related and contract based assets are amortized over periods ranging from 1 to 16 years with a weighted average original life of 11 years technology assets are typically amortized over 7  years 

derivatives 

derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at fair value where the company has entered into master netting agreements with counterparties the derivative positions are netted by counterparty and are reported accordingly in other assets or other liabilities changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings each period unless the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow or net investment hedge 

the company has historically designated the following hedging relationships for certain transactions i a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment “fair value hedge” ii a hedge of the variability in cash flows from a recognized variablerate asset or liability or forecasted transaction “cash flow hedge” and iii a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation “net investment hedge” 

in order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value cash flow or a net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item the documentation must include a description of the hedging instrument the hedged item the risk being hedged aon’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness additionally the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis aon assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges and measures and records hedge ineffectiveness if any at the end of each quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances require 

for a derivative designated as a hedging instrument the changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment a fair value hedge the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged the effect is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value for a cash flow hedge that qualifies for hedge accounting the effective portion of the change in fair value of a hedging instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income “oci” and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same period the hedged item impacts earnings the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings for a net investment hedge the effective portion of the change in fair value 

of the hedging instrument is recognized in oci as part of the cumulative translation adjustment while the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in earnings 

changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as part of a hedging relationship commonly referred to as an “economic hedge” are recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of income 

the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1 the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised 2 the qualifying criteria are no longer met or 3 management removes the designation of the hedging relationship 

foreign currency 

certain of the company’s nonus operations use their respective local currency as their functional currency these operations that do not have the us dollar as their functional currency translate their financial statements at the current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses using rates that approximate those in effect during the period the resulting translation adjustments are included in net foreign currency translation adjustments within the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency are included in other income  within the consolidated statements of income the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses on the consolidated statements of income were losses of 9 million  11 million  and 1 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively included in these amounts were hedging losses  of 7 million  in 2016  and hedging losses  of 19 million  in both 2015  and 2014  

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are recognized for the effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that are currently in effect the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the period when the rate change is enacted 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified deferred tax assets are realized by having sufficient future taxable income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes otherwise payable the sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in carryback years and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible 

the company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold but are not highly certain are initially and subsequently measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authority only information that is available at the reporting date is considered in the company’s recognition and measurement analysis and events or changes in facts and circumstances are accounted for in the period in which the event or change in circumstance occurs   

the company records penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes in the company’s consolidated statements of income 

new accounting pronouncements 

income tax consequences of intercompany transactions 

in october 2016 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new accounting guidance on the income tax consequences of intraentity asset transfers other than inventory the guidance will require that the seller and buyer recognize the consolidated current and deferred income tax consequences of a transaction in the period the transaction occurs rather than deferring to a future period and recognizing those consequences when the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recovered through use ie depreciated amortized impaired an entity will apply the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption the new guidance is effective for aon in the first quarter of 2018 and the company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements 

statement of cash flows 

in august 2016 the fasb issued new accounting guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments under the new guidance an entity will no longer have discretion to choose the classification for a number of transactions including contingent consideration payments made after a business combination proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees the new standard will be effective for the company in the first quarter of 2018 with early application permitted an entity will apply the new guidance through retrospective adjustment to all periods presented the retrospective approach includes a practical expedient that entities may apply should retrospective application be impracticable in this case the amendments for these issues may be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable the guidance will not have a material impact upon the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows 

credit losses 

in june 2016 the fasb issued new accounting guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments the new guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates an entity will apply the new guidance through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective the guidance is effective for aon in the first quarter of 2020 and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019 aon is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as the method of transition and period of adoption

licensing and regulation 

our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate as well as us federal and state laws see the discussion contained in the risk factors section in part i item 1a of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business 

risk solutions 

regulatory authorities in the countries or states in the us in which the operating subsidiaries of our risk solutions segment conduct business may require individual or company licensing to act as producers brokers agents third party administrators managing general agents reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters 

under the laws of most countries and states regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting renewing and revoking producers brokers and agents licenses to transact business in the country or state the operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular country or state which may require among other things that a firm operates in the country or state through a local corporation in a few countries and states licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities in such cases our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the country or state 

our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are enforced by the financial conduct authority fca in the uk by federal and state agencies in the us and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business licensing of agents monitoring of trade practices policy form approval limits on commission rates and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements 

insurance authorities in the uk us and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds such as premiums and claims proceeds held in a fiduciary capacity for others these laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them 

further certain of our business activities within the risk solutions segment are governed by other regulatory bodies including investment securities and futures licensing authorities for example in the us we use aon securities inc a usregistered brokerdealer and investment advisor member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra and securities investor protection corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of aon for capital management

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect material risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain forwardlooking statements as discussed in the business section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur 

the following are material risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere these risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence 

risks relating to the company generally 

competitive risks 

an overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our businesses 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our risk solutions business the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premium charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect our risk solutions business as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients a growing number of insolvencies and consolidation associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business also error and omission claims against us which we refer to as eo claims generally increase in economic downturns also adversely affecting our brokerage business 

the results of our hr solutions business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business as well as reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues andor collectability of receivables could be adversely affected in addition our revenues from many of our outsourcing contracts depend upon the number of our clients employees or the number of participants in our clients employee benefit plans and could be adversely affected by layoffs we may also experience decreased demand for our services as a result of postponed or terminated outsourcing of human resources functions reduced demand for our services could increase price competition 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

we believe that competition in our risk solutions segment is based on service product features price commission structure financial strength ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition in this regard we compete with a large number of global national regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers 

our hr solutions segment competes with a large number of independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world many of our competitors in this area are expanding the services they offer or reducing prices in an attempt to gain additional business additionally some competitors have established and are likely to continue to establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs 

our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases greater name recognition stronger presence in certain geographies and more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have in addition new competitors alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop large and wellcapitalized competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster or price their services more aggressively they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower the cost of our services or decrease the level of service provided to clients which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the united states these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our five largest nonus dollar exposures are the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and indian rupee however we also have exposures to other currencies which can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange risks are present in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and as a result changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results for example the strengthening of the value of the us dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to us dollar even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use were 740 million  at december 31 2015  and are reported in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 34 billion  at december 31 2015  and are reported in fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2015  these longterm investments had a carrying value of 135 million  adverse changes in interest rates and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results we may continue to experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and shortterm investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain at or near their current low levels or if negative yields on deposits or investments as we have experienced in japan and certain jurisdictions in the european union continue or arise in the jurisdictions in which we operate on the other hand higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company in addition during times of stress in the banking industry counterparty risk can quickly escalate potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work 

our pension obligations could adversely affect our shareholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in particular lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in our major pension plans in addition the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense as a result we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated which could adversely affect shareholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

the significance of our worldwide pension plans means that our pension contributions and expense are comparatively sensitive to various market and demographic factors these factors include equity and bond market returns the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations in any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year 

we currently plan to contribute approximately 150 million  to our major pension plans in 2016  although we may elect to contribute more total cash contributions to these pension plans in 2015  were 194 million  which was a decrease  of 122 million  compared to 2014  

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2015  we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 57 billion  the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we also are subject to risks that at the time any of our outstanding debt matures we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2015 we had two committed credit facilities outstanding our 400 million us credit facility expiring in march 2017 the 2017 facility and our 900 million multicurrency us credit facility expiring in february 2020 the 2020 facility each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities included customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda tested quarterly during 2015  we had no borrowings under and were in compliance with these financial covenants and all other covenants contained in the 2017 facility and 2020 facility 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions or refinance any of our debt if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital reduce our financial flexibility and limit our ability to implement on corporate strategy our senior debt ratings at december 31 2015  were a  with a stable outlook standard  poors bbb  with a stable outlook fitch inc and baa2  with a stable outlook moodys investor services our commercial paper ratings were a2  sp f2  fitch and p2  moodys during 2014 moodys investor services changed their outlook from positive to stable 

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities such changes could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers as a result of a change in the agencys view of us its industry outlook or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies and could adversely limit our access to capital and our competitive position 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential 

governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency furthermore seemingly nationally or regionally localized political and economic changes could have a wider negative impact on our businesses that expands beyond our operations in the immediately affected jurisdiction the continued concerns regarding the ability of certain european countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets this instability has in turn led to questions regarding the future viability of the euro as the common currency for the area as various scenarios could result in some countries choosing to return to their former local currencies in an effort to regain control over their domestic economies and monetary policies this uncertainty has had a dampening effect on growth potential in europe and if it deteriorates may have a material negative impact on our european business as well as that of our clients further any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets or profitability denominated in that currency potentially result in charges to our statement of operations and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency us credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

the benefits of our redomestication may not be realized or may be offset in whole or in part by factors that we do not control 

there can be no assurance that all of the goals of our redomestication will be achievable particularly as the achievement of the benefits are in many important respects subject to factors that we do not control these factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors analysts and uk and us taxing and other authorities 

our effective tax rates and the benefits from our redomestication are also subject to a variety of other factors many of which are beyond our ability to control such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the uk and the us and other countries the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions currency exchange rate fluctuations especially as between the british pound and the us dollar and significant changes in trade monetary or fiscal policies of the uk or the us including changes in interest rates the impact of these factors individually and in the aggregate is difficult to predict in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be and in fact often seem to be interrelated and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or alternatively reduced offset or more than offset by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors 

on september 4 2013 we received from the internal revenue service irs an executed closing agreement pursuant to which the company and the irs agreed that the merger pursuant to which the redomestication occurred did not cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes this agreement substantially reduced the risk that actions taken to date might cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes under the current tax statute and regulations however the united states congress the irs the united kingdom parliament or uk tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a nonus corporation or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past and there can be no assurance that any such provisions if enacted or promulgated would not have retroactive application to us the redomestication or any subsequent actions our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we were to be subject to us corporate income tax as a domestic corporation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the united kingdom and other jurisdictions including the united states or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties could subject us to increased taxation 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the uk us and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the transfer pricing of revenues and costs acquisitions and dispositions and the portion of the income of nonus subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities 

we believe that our redomestication and related transactions should support our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the uk has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject nonuk earnings to uk tax when such earnings are repatriated to the uk in the form of dividends from nonuk subsidiaries this should allow us to optimize our capital allocation and deploy efficient fiscal structures however we cannot provide any assurances as to 

what our tax rate will be in any period because of among other things uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions as well as changes in us and other tax laws treaties and regulations our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of the uk and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate 

we also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other matter such as changes in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law audits and other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those relating to restructuring pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables contingencies sharebased payments income taxes and estimates and assumptions used for our long term outsourcing contracts we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments in accounting principles and other factors actual results could differ from these estimates or changes in assumptions estimates or policies or the developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to longterm contracts may change our initial estimates of future contract results which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders equity and cash flows 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

our principal assets are the shares of capital stock and indebtedness of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligation paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that these subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in addition due to differences in tax rates repatriation of funds from certain countries into the uk through the us could have unfavorable tax ramifications for us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to eo claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the company as a whole 

we assist our clients with various matters including placing of insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters providing actuarial services investment consulting and asset management services and outsourcing various human resources functions eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured the failure to give errorfree advice in our consulting business or the failure to correctly execute transactions in the human resources outsourcing and benefits administration businesses it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the companys financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others the maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods any anticipated payment amounts under guarantees and indemnifications that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable are included in our consolidated financial statements these amounts may not represent actual future payments if any for these guarantees and indemnifications 

the ultimate outcome of these claims lawsuits proceedings guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future statements of financial position results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or increase competition 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the uk companies act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the fca the us securities laws including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance by limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including training and employee expenses adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established 

with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act fatca in the us and the bribery act of 2010 uk bribery act in the uk impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in a number of cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries 

for example fatca has resulted in and will likely continue to result in increased compliance costs fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties in addition regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our operations results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations changes in application or interpretation of laws and regulations and our continued operational changes and development into new jurisdictions and new service offerings also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject these changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or lines of businesses and other developments in our services we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked be unable to obtain new licenses and be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past 

in addition new regulatory or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us these developments include 

 changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance likewise increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

with respect to our risk solutions segment our business regulatory oversight generally also includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or managing general underwriting operations and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance broking and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with 

regulations affecting our client further regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations 

services provided in our hr solutions segment are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provided to or businesses conducted by our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated thereby indirectly impacting the manner in which we provide services to those clients in particular our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the united states insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans uncertainty regarding or any changes to state or federal law or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies including the effects of health care reform by the us government could delay client adoption of our healthcare exchanges impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our healthcare exchanges or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions in addition more generally within our hr solutions segment changes in laws government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare such as medical plans defined contribution such as 401k plans defined benefit such as pension plans or payroll delivery may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 

if we violate the laws and regulation to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

in addition our businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions as regulators and other government agencies continue to examine the operations of the company and its subsidiaries there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future these and other initiatives from national state and local officials may subject the company to judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause the company to be required to restructure its operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues or higher operational costs thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition or operating results 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates employees clients strategic partners and others however the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of increased shareholder approval requirements we have less flexibility as an english public limited company with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

english law imposes some restrictions on certain corporate actions by which previously as a delaware corporation we were not constrained for example english law provides that a board of directors may only allot or issue securities with the prior authorization of shareholders such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current authorization is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2016 this authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this authorization at each annual general meeting 

english law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for the articles of association or shareholders in general meeting to exclude preemptive rights such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution the current exclusion is effective until the earlier of our next annual general meeting or august 31 2016 this exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew this exclusion at each annual general meeting 

english law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of off market purchases without the prior approval of our shareholders such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years our shares are traded on the nyse which is not a recognized investment exchange in the uk consequently any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an off market purchase the current authorization expires on june 17 2020 renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically 

the enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult 

because we are a public limited company incorporated under english law investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in us courts than would have been the case for us judgments obtained against aon corporation in addition it may be more difficult or impossible to bring some types of claims against us in courts in england than it would be to bring similar claims against a us company in a us court 

we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales therefore it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the united states in order to enforce judgments of us courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 

there is doubt as to the enforceability in england and wales in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts of civil liabilities solely based on the us federal securities laws the english courts will however treat any amount payable by us under the us judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the english courts to enforce this debt against us the following criteria must be satisfied in order for the english court to enforce the debt created by the us judgment 

 operational and commercial risks 

our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other professional personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy the unexpected loss of services of any of our senior management team could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy competition for experienced professional personnel is intense and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected we must develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of personnel retention while we have plans for key management succession and longterm compensation plans designed to retain our senior employees if our succession plans do not operate effectively our business could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in and sourcing from foreign countries including 

 16 

 the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods tornadoes climate events or weather patterns such as el ni ñ o and the recent significant winter storm events in the uk and us and pandemic health events as well as manmade disasters including acts of terrorism military actions and cyberterrorism the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our risk solutions professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breaches power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of existing new or upgraded computer systems telecommunications and other related systems and operations in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations we could potentially lose access to key executives and personnel client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some are outsourced all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses and security breaches we regularly experience attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access in the future these types of incidents could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data in addition we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage 

our reputation and cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues additionally in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our online methods of delivering our services 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees and clients confidential and proprietary information and in the case of our hr solutions clients confidential information about clients employees compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue furthermore our clients may not be receptive to services delivered through our information technology systems and networks due to concerns regarding transaction security user privacy the reliability and quality of internet service and other reasons the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

in many jurisdictions including in the european union and the united states we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools conversely investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of inpoint and grip repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process our competitors are developing competing databases and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions likewise we have invested significantly in our hr bpo business and platform innovations in software cloud computing or other technologies that alter how these services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments 

we are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets nevertheless for those efforts to produce meaningful value we are reliant on a number of other factors some of which our outside of our control for example our hr solutions segment has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the us manage their growing health care expenses in order for these exchanges to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances 

if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities and damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality broking risk management and hr solutions so that we can understand our clients needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to satisfy these needs if a client is not satisfied with our services it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses and could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups andor trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work especially our actuarial services in our hr solutions business involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance similarly in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones as mentioned above   negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances including operations regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct this damage to our reputation could further affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business having a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security funds transfers data processing and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients andor employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

our risk solutions business collects premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are remitted to the insureds similarly part of our hr solutions outsourcing business handles payroll processing and retirement and pension administration for several of our clients consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients and in the case of hr solutions their employees while payroll retirement plan funds or pension payments are being processed this function creates a risk of loss 

arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions or errors relating to transaction processing we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses the entry into new lines of business the integration of acquired businesses and the growth and development of these businesses 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms complete transactions and in the case of acquisitions successfully integrate them into our existing businesses if a proposed transaction is not consummated the time and resources spent in researching it could adversely result in missed opportunities to locate and acquire another business if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets 

from time to time either through acquisitions or internal development we enter lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business these new lines of business or new products and services present the company with additional risks particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed such risks include the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful the possibility that marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants external factors such as compliance with new or revised regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating primarily to our risk solutions segment 

results in our risk solutions segment may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

results in our risk solutions segment have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 

 20 

 in addition our increasing focus on new product offerings within the risk solutions space exposes us to additional risks for example inpoint and grip are relatively new offerings which may face challenges within the insurance industry or conversely if successful may face increasing pressure from competitors who develop competing offerings as our business like the economy as a whole becomes more technology focused the speed at which our products are subject to challenge or becoming outdated is consistently increasing 

our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry 

in the past the attorney general of new york brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community these actions have created uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices it is possible that regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future if they do so compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business 

risks relating primarily to our hr solutions segment 

the profitability of our outsourcing and consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

in our hr solutions segment our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to change in our business adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

most new outsourcing arrangements undergo an implementation process whereby our systems and processes are customized to match a clients plans and programs the cost of this process is estimated by us and often partially funded by our clients if our actual implementation expense exceeds our estimate or if the ongoing service cost is greater than anticipated the client contract may be less profitable than expected 

even though outsourcing clients typically sign longterm contracts some of these contracts may be terminated at any time with or without cause by our client upon 90 to 360 days written notice our outsourcing clients are generally required to pay a termination fee however this amount may not be sufficient to offset the costs we incurred in connection with the implementation and system setup or fully compensate us for the profit we would have received if the contract had not been cancelled a client may choose to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress such as the business or financial condition of the client or general economic conditions when any of our engagements are terminated we may not be able to eliminate associated ongoing costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the impact on profitability any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors cost of living adjustment provisions the extent of ongoing clients perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions our profitability in providing hr bpo services is largely based on our ability to drive cost efficiencies during the term of our contracts for such services if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer our cost efficiencies may be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments our ability to secure new consulting engagements our ability to forecast demand for consulting services and consequently appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce employee attrition and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development 

we might not be able to achieve the cost savings required to sustain and increase our profit margins in our hr solutions business 

we provide our outsourcing services over long terms for variable or fixed fees that generally are less than our clients historical costs to provide for themselves the services we contract to deliver also clients demand for cost reductions may 

increase over the term of the agreement as a result we bear the risk of increases in the cost of delivering hr outsourcing services to our clients and our margins associated with particular contracts will depend on our ability to control our costs of performance under those contracts and meet our service commitments costeffectively over time some of our operating expenses will increase as we invest in additional infrastructure and implement new technologies to maintain our competitive position and meet our client service commitments we must anticipate and respond to the dynamics of our industry and business by using quality systems process management improved asset utilization and effective supplier management tools we must do this while continuing to grow our business so that our fixed costs are spread over an increasing revenue base if we are not able to achieve this our ability to sustain and increase profitability may be reduced 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors andor assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies selection or removal of investment managers the investment in different investment instruments and products and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciaryagency capacity albeit without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance third parties we recommend or select such as investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses of some or all of the capital that has been invested these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control regardless of the cause clients experiencing losses may assert claims against us and these claims may be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciaryagency duties or other alleged errors or omissions client experiencing losses or lower than expected investment returns may also leave us for our competitors 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

transfers of the class a ordinary shares may be subject to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk which would increase the cost of dealing in the class a ordinary shares 

stamp duty andor sdrt are imposed in the uk on certain transfers of chargeable securities which include shares in companies incorporated in the uk at a rate of 05 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 15 percent 

our class a ordinary shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of depository trust company dtc transfers of shares held in book entry form through dtc will not attract a charge to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk a transfer of the shares from within the dtc system out of dtc and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the dtc system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 05 percent of any consideration which is payable by the transferee of the shares any such duty must be paid and the relevant transfer document stamped by hmrc before the transfer can be registered in the books of aon uk if those shares are redeposited into dtc the redeposit will attract stamp duty or sdrt at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

we have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the dtc system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that sdrt may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository before the transfer can be registered in our books the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to sdrt which will be charged at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

following the decision of the first tier tribunal tax chamber in hsbc holdings plc the bank of new york mellon corporation v hmrc  2012 ukftt 163 tc and the announcement by hmrc that it will not seek to appeal the decision hmrc is no longer enforcing the charge to sdrt on the issue of shares into either eu or noneu depository receipt or clearance systems 

if the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of dtc then transactions in our securities may be disrupted 

the facilities of dtc are a widelyused mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the dtc system which include many large banks and brokerage firms we believe that prior to the merger 

approximately 99 of the outstanding shares of common stock of aon corporation were held within the dtc system the class a ordinary shares of aon plc are at present eligible for deposit and clearing within the dtc system in connection with the closing of the redomestication we entered into arrangements with dtc whereby we agreed to indemnify dtc for any stamp duty andor sdrt that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our class a ordinary shares in addition we have obtained a ruling from hmrc in respect of the stamp duty and sdrt consequences of the reorganization and sdrt has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of class a ordinary shares with the initial depository dtc will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the class a ordinary shares if dtc determines at any time that the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe the class a ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a us securities exchange or inclusion in the sp 500 and trading in the class a ordinary shares would be disrupted while we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the class a ordinary shares

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary of 2015  financial results 

during 2015  we continued to face headwinds that had adversely impacted our business in prior periods in our risk solutions segment these headwinds included adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates economic weakness in continental europe and a negative market impact in our reinsurance business in our hr solutions segment these headwinds included price compression in our benefits administration business and economic weakness in continental europe 

the following is a summary of our 2015  financial results 

 

 

 

 

 we focus on four key nongaap metrics that we communicate to shareholders organic revenue adjusted operating margins adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow the following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2015  

 

 

 27 

per share in 2015  an increase  of 047  per share or 8  from 571  per share in 2014  the increase  demonstrates solid operational performance and effective capital management highlighted by 16 billion  of share repurchase during 2015  

 

review of consolidated results 

general 

in our discussion of operating results we sometimes refer to certain nongaap supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results 

organic revenue 

we use supplemental information related to organic revenue to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue is a nongaap measure and excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes acquisitions divestitures transfers between business units fiduciary investment income reimbursable expenses and certain unusual items supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they may not make identical adjustments reconciliations of this nongaap measure organic revenue growth percentages to the reported commissions fees and other revenue growth percentages have been provided under the review by segment caption below 

adjusted operating margins 

we use adjusted operating margins as a nongaap measure of core operating performance of our risk solutions and hr solutions segments adjusted operating margins exclude the impact of certain items including intangible asset amortization litigation settlements and restructuring charges because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance this supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to reported operating margins is as follows in millions 







 adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we also use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization and legacy litigation in 2015 and 2014 and restructuring charges and headquarter relocation costs in 2013 along with related income taxes because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings this supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

the effective tax rates used in the us gaap financial statements were 158 and 189 for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively reconciling items are generally taxed at the effective tax rate however after adjusting the underlying annual tax rate to exclude the impact associated with expenses for legacy litigation in the second quarter of 2015 the adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of 2015 was 179 

reconciliations of this nongaap measure to the reported diluted earnings per share are as follows in millions except per share data 







free cash flow 

we use free cash flow defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance this supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto the use of this nongaap measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows in millions 

impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

because we conduct business in more than 120 countries foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating last years revenue expenses and net income using the current years foreign exchange rates 

translating prior year results at current year foreign exchange rates currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of 041 on adjusted net income per diluted share during the year ended december 31 2015  currency fluctuations had unfavorable impacts of 011 and 004 in the years ended 2014  and 2013  respectively when prior year results were translated at rates prevalent in those years these translations are performed for comparative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations available cash reserves committed credit facilities and debt capacity available through public debt markets both short and longterm our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases pension obligations and shareholder dividends we believe that cash flows from operations and available debt financing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including principal and interest payments on debt 

obligations capital expenditures pension contributions cash restructuring costs and anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes as well as amounts restricted as to their use funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in fiduciary assets in the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding amount in fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds generally cannot be used for general corporate purposes and are not a source of liquidity for us 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased 28 million  to 740 million  in 2015  during 2015  cash flow from operating activities increased   197 million  to 20 billion  additional sources of funds in 2015  included net sales of short term investments of 9 million  205 million  of proceeds from the sale of businesses and issuances of debt net of repayments  of 253 million  the primary uses of funds in 2015  included share repurchases of 16 billion  cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans of 194 million  acquisition of businesses of 16 million  dividends paid to shareholders of 323 million  and capital expenditures of 290 million  

our investment grade rating is important to us for a number of reasons the most important of which is preserving our financial flexibility if our credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade the interest expense on any outstanding balances on our credit facilities would increase and we could incur additional requests for pension contributions to manage unforeseen situations we have committed credit lines of approximately 13 billion  and we endeavor to manage our obligations to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings at december 31 2015  we had no borrowings on these credit lines 

during the quarter ended december 31 2015 the company reclassified certain cash flows related to employee shares withheld for taxes to align itself with peers and industry practice this resulted in a reclassification of 227 million and 170 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively from accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities within cash flows from operating activities to issuance of shares for employee benefit plans within cash flows from financing activities resulting in a corresponding increase in cash flows from operating activities 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2015   increased   197 million  or 11  to 20 billion  this amount represents net income reported by the company as adjusted for gains or losses on sales of businesses financial instruments and foreign exchange and our noncash expenses which include sharebased compensation depreciation and amortization as well as changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and collection of receivables the increase from the prior year was primarily driven by reductions in pension contributions cash taxes paid and restructuring payments as well as working capital improvements partially offset by an increase in payments for legacy litigation 

pension contributions were 194 million  during 2015  compared to 316 million  during 2014  in 2016  we expect to contribute approximately 150 million  to our pension plans with the majority attributable to nonus pension plans which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates 

we expect cash generated by operations for 2015  to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations fund the cash requirements of our restructuring programs finance capital expenditures continue purchases of shares under our share repurchase program and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows we have committed credit facilities of approximately 13 billion  of which all was available at december 31 2015  and can access these facilities on a same day or next day basis additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed

in our capacity as an insurance broker or agent we collect premiums from insureds and after deducting our commission remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter we also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds which are then returned to the insureds unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity in addition some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf the levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums claims and refunds make payments to underwriters and insureds collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf and foreign currency movements fiduciary assets because of their nature are generally invested in very liquid securities with highlyrated creditworthy financial institutions in our consolidated statements of financial position the amount we report for fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal our fiduciary assets included cash and investments of 34 billion  and 40 billion and fiduciary receivables of 65 billion  and 77 billion at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively while we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments the cash and investments are not owned by us and cannot be used for general corporate purposes 

as disclosed in note 13 fair value measurements and financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds money market funds are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value consistent with market convention we consider cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value these money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions we are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments 

as of december 31 2015  our investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments had a fair value of 14 billion  and are reported as shortterm investments or fiduciary assets in the consolidated statements of financial position depending on their nature and initial maturity 

the following table summarizes our fiduciary assets and nonfiduciary cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2015  in millions 



share repurchase program

borrowings 

total debt at december 31 2015  was 57 billion  which represents an increase  of 155 million  compared to december 31 2014  this increase  is primarily due to issuances of debt net of repayments  of 253 million  which is net of a decrease in commercial paper outstanding of 118 million compared to december 31 2014

 financial condition 

at december 31 2015  our net assets were 62 billion  representing total assets minus total liabilities a decrease  from 66 billion  at december 31 2014  the decrease  was due primarily to share repurchases of 16 billion  dividends of 323 million  and an increase  in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 289 million  related primarily to an increase in the postretirement benefit obligation partially offset by net income of 14 billion  for the year ended december 31 2015  working capital increased  by 77 million  from 809 million  at december 31 2014  to 886 million  at december 31 2015

review by segment 

general 

we serve clients through the following segments 

 

 risk solutions 



the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units and is most closely correlated 

with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values during 2015  pricing was modestly negative on average globally and we still consider this a soft market in a soft market premium rates flatten or decrease along with commission revenues due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds 

additionally continuing through 2015  we faced difficult conditions as a result of continued weakness in the global economy and the repricing of credit risk weak economic conditions in many markets around the globe have reduced our customers demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products which have had a negative impact on our operational results 

risk solutions generated approximately 64  of our consolidated total revenues in 2015  revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients policy renewals the net effect of new and lost business the timing of services provided to our clients and the income we earn on investments which is heavily influenced by shortterm interest rates 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms as well as with individual brokers agents and direct writers of insurance coverage specifically we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises professional groups insurance companies governments health care providers and nonprofit groups among others provide affinity products for professional liability life disability income and personal lines for individuals associations and businesses provide products and services via grip solutions provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services capital raising contingent capital financing insurancelinked securitizations and derivative applications provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients provide risk consulting actuarial loss prevention and administrative services to businesses and consumers and manage captive insurance companies

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with us gaap to prepare these financial statements we made estimates assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 

in accordance with our policies we regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to those concerning revenue recognition restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes and base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

risk solutions segment revenues primarily include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable we consider revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when all of the following four conditions are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 3 delivery or performance has occurred and 4 collectability is reasonably assured for brokerage commissions revenue is typically recognized at the completion of the placement process assuming all four criteria required to recognize revenue have been met the placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data 

hr solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly project or fixedfee basis revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus arrangements are recognized as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met revenues from fixedfee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportionalperformance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement revenues from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants net of a reserve for estimated cancellations assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met reimbursements received for outofpocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues our outsourcing contracts typically have threetofive year terms for benefits services and fivetoten year terms for human resources business process outsourcing hr bpo services we recognize revenues as services are performed assuming all four criteria to recognize revenue have been met we may also receive implementation fees from clients either upfront or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant lump sum implementation fees received from a client are typically deferred and recognized ratably over the ongoing contract services period if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract a 

loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date 

in connection with our longterm outsourcing service agreements highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on our systems and operating processes for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting specific incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue 

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada our significant us uk netherlands and canadian pension plans are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our us uk netherlands and canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted 

in 2016 we estimate pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost for major plans to increase by 15 million to a benefit of approximately 54 million the increase in the benefit is primarily due to a change in our approach to measuring service and interest cost effective december 31 2015 and for 2016 expense we have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows in 2015 and prior years we estimated these components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost by applying a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs this change does not affect the measurement of the projected benefit obligation as the change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial gain loss recorded in other comprehensive income we accounted for this change as a change in estimate and accordingly will account for it prospectively 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the us the netherlands canada and uk plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2015  our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2016  amortization of loss by country amounts in millions 

the unrecognized prior service cost income at december 31 2015  was 9 million 46 million and 7 million in the us uk and other plans respectively 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach 

recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current years value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2015  the marketrelated value of assets was 21 billion  we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2015  the fair value of plan assets was 20 billion  

our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix as of december 31 2015  

 in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we surveyed multiple thirdparty financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the actual asset allocation at december 31 2015  was 66 equity and 34 fixed income securities for the qualified plan 

the investment policy for each uk and nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and nonus category our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan further target allocations are subject to change as of december 31 2015  the uk and nonus plans were invested between 23 and 34 in equity and between 77 and 66 in fixed income securities respectively 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a twenty five basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2015  in millions 

 45 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a twenty five basis point increase and decrease in our estimated discount rate would have on our estimated 2016  pension expense in millions 

holding other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a twenty five basis point increase and decrease in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2016  pension expense in millions 

estimated future contributions 

we estimate contributions of approximately 150 million  to our pension plans in 2016  as compared with 194 million  in 2015  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customer relationships technology noncompete agreements or other purchased intangibles 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we also test the acquired tradenames which also are not amortized for impairment we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others no events occurred during 2015  that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components is a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

the goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value including goodwill of the corresponding reporting unit if the more likely than not threshold is not met then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two step analysis step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step two step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow dcf model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weightedaverage cost of capital method at the date of 

evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry based on tests performed in both 2015  and 2014  there was no indication of goodwill impairment and no further testing was required 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2015  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

restricted share units rsus are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

performance share awards psas are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation cost is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest performancebased sharebased payment award plan is the leadership performance plan lpp which has a threeyear performance period the 2013 to 2015 performance period ended on december 31 2015 the 2012 to 2014 performance period ended on december 31 2014 and the 2011 to 2013 performance period ended on december 31 2013the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2014 to 2016 and 2015 to 2017 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both lpp plans would have increased our 2015  expense by approximately 27 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 69 million as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on managements assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in this assessment significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a more likely than not determination we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for permanently reinvested earnings of certain subsidiaries additional income taxes could be recorded or incurred if we change our investment strategy relating to these subsidiaries which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

we base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on managements interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate managements assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

we operate in many jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed in such jurisdictions we typically obtain professional guidance when available and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations in addition several factors could change the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities including the following

note 2 summary of significant accounting principles and practices of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks see note 2 summary of significant accounting principles and practices of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars and euros but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2015  we have hedged approximately 45 of our uk subsidiaries expected exposures to both us dollar and euro transactions for the years ending december 31 2016  and 2017  respectively we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and shortterm assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 32 million and 14 million at december 31 2016  and 2017  respectively 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the north america continental europe and the asia pacific region a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 39 million and 41 million to 2016  and 2017  pretax income respectively a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 39 million and 41 million to 2016  and 2017  pretax income respectively 

we have longterm debt outstanding with a fair market value of 54 billion  and 53 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively this fair value was greater than  the carrying value by 02 billion  at december 31 2015  and 05 billion   greater than  the carrying value at december 31 2014  a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 10 or an increase of 11 respectively at december 31 2015  

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain forwardlooking statements as discussed in the business section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur 

the following are risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere these risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence 

risks relating to the company generally 

competitive risks 

an overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our businesses 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our risk solutions business the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premium charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect our risk solutions business as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients a growing number of insolvencies and consolidation associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business also error and omission claims against us which we refer to as eo claims generally increase in economic downturns also adversely affecting our brokerage business 

the results of our hr solutions business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business as well as reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy liquidate their operations or consolidate our revenues andor collectability of receivables could be adversely affected in addition our revenues from many of our outsourcing contracts depend upon the number of our clients employees or the number of participants in our clients employee benefit plans and could be adversely affected by layoffs we may also experience decreased demand for our services as a result of postponed or terminated outsourcing of human resources functions reduced demand for our services could increase price competition 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

we believe that competition in our risk solutions segment is based on service product features price commission structure financial strength ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition in this regard we compete with a large number of national regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers 

our hr solutions segment competes with a large number of independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world many of our competitors in this area are expanding the services they offer or reducing prices in an attempt to gain additional business additionally some competitors have established and are likely to continue to establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs 

our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases greater name recognition stronger presence in certain geographies and more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have in addition new competitors alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop large and wellcapitalized competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster or price their services more aggressively they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have 

to lower the cost of our services or decrease the level of service provided to clients which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our functional currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the united states these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our five largest nonus dollar exposures are the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and indian rupee however we also have exposures to other currencies which can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange risks are present in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and as a result changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use were 768 million  at december 31 2014  and are reported in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 40 billion at december 31 2014 and are reported in fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2014  these longterm investments had a carrying value of 143 million  adverse changes in interest rates and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company 

our pension obligations could adversely affect our shareholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our major plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in particular lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in several of our major pension plans in addition the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense as a result we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated which could adversely affect shareholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

the significance of our worldwide pension plans means that our pension contributions and expense are comparatively sensitive to various market and demographic factors these factors include equity and bond market returns the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations in any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year 

we currently plan to contribute approximately 220 million  to our major pension plans in 2015  although we may elect to contribute more total cash contributions to these pension plans in 2014  were 316 million  which was a decrease  of 207 million  compared to 2013  

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2014  we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 56 billion  the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we also bear risk at the time debt matures 

as of december 31 2014 we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding our 400 million us credit facility expiring in march 2017 the 2017 facility and our €650 million  792 million  based on exchange rates at december 31 2014  european credit facility expiring in october 2015 the 2015 facility on february 2 2015 we replaced our 2015 facility with a new 900 million multicurrency us credit facility expiring in february 2020 the 2020 facility each of these facilities was intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs in addition each of these facilities included customary representations warranties and covenants including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda in each case tested quarterly at december 31 2014  we had no borrowings under and were in compliance with these financial covenants and all other covenants contained in the 2015 facility and 2017 facility 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures additional acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions or refinance any of our debt if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital and reduce our financial flexibility our senior debt ratings at december 31 2014  were a  with a stable outlook standard  poors bbb  with a stable outlook fitch inc and baa2  with a stable outlook moodys investor services our commercial paper ratings were a2  sp f2  fitch and p2  moodys during 2014  moodys investor services changed their outlook from positive to stable 

real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings which could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency furthermore seemingly nationally or regionally localized political and economic changes could have a wider negative impact on our businesses that expands beyond our operations in the immediately affected jurisdiction the continued concerns regarding the ability of certain european countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets this instability has in turn led to questions regarding the future viability of the euro as the common currency for the area as various scenarios could result in some countries choosing to return to their former local currencies in an effort to regain control over their domestic economies and monetary policies this uncertainty has had a dampening effect on growth potential in europe and if it deteriorates may have a material negative impact on our european business as well as that of our clients further any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets or profitability denominated in that currency potentially result in charges to our statement of operations and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our multicurrency us credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

the benefits of our redomestication may not be realized or may be offset in whole or in part by factors that we do not control 

there can be no assurance that all of the goals of our redomestication will be achievable particularly as the achievement of the benefits are in many important respects subject to factors that we do not control these factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors analysts and uk and us taxing and other authorities 

our effective tax rates and the benefits from our redomestication are also subject to a variety of other factors many of which are beyond our ability to control such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the uk and the us and other countries the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions currency exchange rate fluctuations especially as between the british pound and the us dollar and significant changes in trade monetary or fiscal policies of the uk or the us including changes in interest rates the impact of these factors individually and in the aggregate is difficult to predict in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be and in fact often seem to be interrelated and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or alternatively reduced offset or more than offset by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors 

on september 4 2013 we received from the internal revenue service irs an executed closing agreement pursuant to which the company and the irs agreed that the merger pursuant to which the redomestication occurred did not cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes this agreement substantially reduced the risk that actions taken to date might cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes under the current tax statute and regulations however the united states congress the irs the united kingdom parliament or uk tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a nonus corporation or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past and there can be no assurance that any such provisions if enacted or promulgated would not have retroactive application to us the redomestication or any subsequent actions our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we were to be subject to us corporate income tax as a domestic corporation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the united kingdom and other jurisdictions including the united states or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties could subject us to increased taxation 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the uk us and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the transfer pricing of revenues and costs acquisitions and dispositions and the portion of the income of nonus subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities 

we believe that our redomestication and related transactions should support our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the uk has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject nonuk earnings to uk tax when such earnings are repatriated to the uk in the form of dividends from nonuk subsidiaries this should allow us to optimize our capital allocation and deploy efficient fiscal structures however we cannot provide any assurances as to what our tax rate will be in any period because of among other things uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions as well as changes in us and other tax laws treaties and regulations our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of the uk and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate 

we also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other matter such as changes in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law audits and other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those relating to restructuring pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables contingencies sharebased payments income taxes and estimates and assumptions used for our long term outsourcing contracts we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments in accounting principles and other factors actual results could differ from these estimates or changes in assumptions estimates or policies or the developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to longterm contracts may change our initial estimates of future contract results which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders equity and cash flows 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets future goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

our principal assets are the shares of capital stock and indebtedness of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligation paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that these subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in addition due to differences in tax rates repatriation of funds from certain countries into the uk through the us could have unfavorable tax ramifications for us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to eo claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the company as a whole 

we assist our clients with various matters including placing of insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters providing actuarial services investment consulting and asset management services and outsourcing various human resources functions eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or sub agents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured the failure to give errorfree advice in our consulting business or the failure to correctly execute transactions in the human resources outsourcing business it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the companys financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the ultimate outcome of these claims lawsuits and proceedings cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future statements of financial position results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others the maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods any anticipated payment amounts under guarantees and indemnifications that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable are included in our consolidated financial statements these amounts may not represent actual future payments if any for these guarantees and indemnifications 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or increase competition 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the uk companies act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the fca the us securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves government contracting and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance by limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including training and employee expenses adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected in addition certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act fatca in the us and the bribery act of 2010 uk bribery act in the uk impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in a number of cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries 

for example fatca has resulted in and will likely continue to result in increased compliance costs fatca requires certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties in addition regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our operations results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations changes in application or interpretation of laws and regulations and our continued operational changes and development into new jurisdictions and new service offerings also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject these changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional licensure requirements or costs 

to our operations and services furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or lines of businesses and other developments in our services we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked be unable to obtain new licenses and be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past 

in addition new regulatory or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us these developments include 

 changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance likewise increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

with respect to our risk solutions segment our business regulatory oversight generally also includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or managing general underwriting operations and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client further regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations 

services provided in our hr solutions segment are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provided to or businesses conducted by our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated thereby indirectly impacting the manner in which we provide services to those clients in particular our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the united states insurance system its role in financing health care delivery and insurance carriers’ use of and payment of commissions to agents brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans uncertainty regarding or any changes to state or federal law or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies including the effects of health care reform by the us government could delay client adoption of our healthcare exchanges impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our healthcare exchanges or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions in addition more generally within our hr solutions segment changes in laws government regulations or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare such as medical plans defined contribution such as 401k plans defined benefit such as pension plans or payroll delivery may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 

 

if we violate the laws and regulation to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

in addition our businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions as regulators and other government agencies continue to examine the operations of the company and its subsidiaries there is no assurance that consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future these and other initiatives from national state and local officials may subject the company to judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause the company to be required to restructure its operations and activities all of which could lead to reputational issues or higher operational costs thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition or operating results 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates clients strategic partners and others however the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of increased shareholder approval requirements we have less flexibility as an english public limited company with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

english law imposes some restrictions on certain corporate actions by which previously as a delaware corporation we were not constrained for example english law provides that a board of directors may only allot or issue securities with the prior authorization of shareholders such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution this authorization will need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically our articles of association authorize the allotment of additional shares and such authorization is effective until march 29 2017 renewal of such authorization will be sought periodically 

english law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for the articles of association or shareholders in general meeting to exclude preemptive rights such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution this exclusion would need to be renewed by our shareholders periodically our articles of association exclude preemptive rights and such exclusion is effective until march 29 2017 renewal of such exclusion will be sought periodically 

english law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of off market purchases without the prior approval of our shareholders such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years our shares are traded on the nyse which is not a recognized investment exchange in the uk consequently any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an off market purchase renewal of this authorization will be sought periodically 

the enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult 

because we are a public limited company incorporated under english law investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in us courts than would have been the case for us judgments obtained against aon corporation in addition it may be more difficult or impossible to bring some types of claims against us in courts in england than it would be to bring similar claims against a us company in a us court 

we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales therefore it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the united states in order to enforce judgments of us courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 

there is doubt as to the enforceability in england and wales in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts of civil liabilities solely based on the us federal securities laws the english courts will however treat any amount payable by us under the us judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the english courts to enforce this debt against us the following criteria must be satisfied in order for the english court to enforce the debt created by the us judgment 

 operational and commercial risks 

our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other professional personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy the unexpected loss of services of any of our senior executive officers could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy competition for experienced professional personnel is intense and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in and sourcing from foreign countries including 

 the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods and tornadoes and pandemic health events as well as manmade disasters including acts of terrorism military actions and cyberterrorism the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our risk solutions professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel offices and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breaches power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of existing new or upgraded computer systems telecommunications and other related systems and operations in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations we could potentially lose access to key executives and personnel client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some are outsourced all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses and security breaches we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business if we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access in the future these types of incidents could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data in addition we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues additionally in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our online methods of delivering our services 

improper disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees and clients confidential and proprietary information and in the case of our hr solutions clients confidential information about clients employees compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance or cyberattacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential personal or proprietary information such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue furthermore our clients may not be receptive to services delivered through our information technology systems and networks due to concerns regarding transaction security user privacy the reliability and quality of internet service and other reasons the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

in many jurisdictions including in the european union and the united states we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of this information these laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in 

which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools conversely investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of grip a repository of global insurance placement information which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance placement process our competitors are developing competing databases and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions likewise we have invested significantly in our hr bpo business and platform innovations in software cloud computing or other technologies that alter how these services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments 

we are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel service offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets nevertheless for those efforts to produce meaningful value we are reliant on a number of other factors some of which our outside of our control for example our hr solutions segment has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the us manage their growing health care expenses in order for these exchanges to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances 

if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities and damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality brokering risk management and hr solutions so that we can understand our clients needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to satisfy these needs if a client is not satisfied with our services it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses and could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups andor trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work especially our actuarial services in our hr solutions business involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance similarly in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may nonetheless claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice and in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones as mentioned above   negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any 

number of activities or circumstances including operations regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct this damage to our reputation could further affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business having a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security fund transfer data processing and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients andor employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

our risk solutions business collects premiums from insureds and after deducting commissions remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are remitted to the insureds similarly part of our hr solutions outsourcing business handles payroll processing for several of our clients consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients and in the case of hr solutions their employees while payroll is being processed this function creates a risk of loss arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions or errors relating to transaction processing we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategy we face risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses the entry into new lines of business the integration of acquired businesses and the growth and development of these businesses 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms complete transactions and in the case of acquisitions successfully integrate such acquisitions into our existing businesses if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets 

from time to time either through acquisitions or internal development we enter lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business these new lines of business or new products and services present the company with additional risks particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed such risks include the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be not be successful the possibility that marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants external factors such as compliance with new or revised regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of 

business failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating primarily to our risk solutions segment 

results in our risk solutions segment may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

results in our risk solutions segment have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 

 in addition our increasing focus on new product offerings within the risk solutions space exposes us to additional risks for example grip is a relatively new and historically untested offering it may fail to catch on within the insurance industry or conversely if successful may face increasing pressure from competitors who develop competing offerings as our business like the economy as a whole becomes more technology focused the speed at which our products are subject to challenge or becoming outdated is consistently increasing 

our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry 

since the attorney general of new york brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community in 2004 there has been uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices it is possible that those regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future if they do so compliance with new regulations along with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business 

risks relating primarily to our hr solutions segment 

the profitability of our outsourcing and consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

in our hr solutions segment our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to change in our business adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

most new outsourcing arrangements undergo an implementation process whereby our systems and processes are customized to match a clients plans and programs the cost of this process is estimated by us and often partially funded by our clients if our actual implementation expense exceeds our estimate or if the ongoing service cost is greater than anticipated the client contract may be less profitable than expected 

even though outsourcing clients typically sign longterm contracts some of these contracts may be terminated at any time with or without cause by our client upon 90 to 360 days written notice our outsourcing clients are generally required to pay a termination fee however this amount may not be sufficient to offset the costs we incurred in connection with the implementation and system setup or fully compensate us for the profit we would have received if the contract had not been cancelled a client may choose to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress such as the business or financial condition of the client or general economic conditions when any of our engagements are terminated we may not be able to eliminate associated ongoing costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the impact on profitability any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors cost of living adjustment provisions the extent of ongoing clients perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions our profitability in providing hr bpo services is largely based on our ability to drive cost efficiencies during the term of our contracts for such services if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer 

we might not be able to achieve the cost savings required to sustain and increase our profit margins in our hr solutions business 

we provide our outsourcing services over long terms for variable or fixed fees that generally are less than our clients historical costs to provide for themselves the services we contract to deliver also clients demand for cost reductions may increase over the term of the agreement as a result we bear the risk of increases in the cost of delivering hr outsourcing services to our clients and our margins associated with particular contracts will depend on our ability to control our costs of performance under those contracts and meet our service commitments costeffectively over time some of our operating expenses will increase as we invest in additional infrastructure and implement new technologies to maintain our competitive position and meet our client service commitments we must anticipate and respond to the dynamics of our industry and business by using quality systems process management improved asset utilization and effective supplier management tools we must do this while continuing to grow our business so that our fixed costs are spread over an increasing revenue base if we are not able to achieve this our ability to sustain and increase profitability may be reduced 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies selection or removal of investment managers the investment in different investment instruments and products and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciaryagency capacity albeit without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance third parties we recommend or select such as investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses of some or all of the capital that has been invested these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control regardless of the cause clients experiencing losses may assert claims against us and these claims may be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciaryagency duties or other alleged errors or omissions 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

transfers of the class a ordinary shares may be subject to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk which would increase the cost of dealing in the class a ordinary shares 

stamp duty andor sdrt are imposed in the uk on certain transfers of chargeable securities which include shares in companies incorporated in the uk at a rate of 05 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 15 percent 

our class a ordinary shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of depository trust company dtc transfers of shares held in book entry form through dtc will not attract a charge to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk a transfer of the shares from within the dtc system out of dtc and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the dtc system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 05 percent of any consideration which is payable by the transferee of the shares any such duty must be paid and the relevant transfer document stamped by hmrc before the transfer can be registered in the books of aon uk if those shares are redeposited into dtc the redeposit will attract stamp duty or sdrt at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

we have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the dtc system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that sdrt may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository before the transfer can be registered in our books the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to sdrt which will be charged at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

following the decision of the first tier tribunal tax chamber in hsbc holdings plc the bank of new york mellon corporation v hmrc  2012 ukftt 163 tc and the announcement by hmrc that it will not seek to appeal the decision hmrc is no longer enforcing the charge to sdrt on the issue of shares into either eu or noneu depository receipt or clearance systems 

if the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of dtc then transactions in our securities may be disrupted 

the facilities of dtc are a widelyused mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the dtc system which include many large banks and brokerage firms we believe that prior to the merger approximately 99 of the outstanding shares of common stock of aon corporation were held within the dtc system the class a ordinary shares of aon plc are at present eligible for deposit and clearing within the dtc system in connection with the closing of the merger we entered into arrangements with dtc whereby we agreed to indemnify dtc for any stamp duty andor sdrt that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our class a ordinary shares in addition we have obtained a ruling from hmrc in respect of the stamp duty and sdrt consequences of the reorganization and sdrt has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of class a ordinary shares with the initial depository dtc will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the class a ordinary shares if dtc determines at any time that the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe the class a ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a us securities exchange or inclusion in the sp 500 and trading in the class a ordinary shares would be disrupted while we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the class a ordinary shares

review of consolidated results 

general 

in our discussion of operating results we sometimes refer to certain nongaap supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results 

organic revenue 

we use supplemental information related to organic revenue to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue is a nongaap measure and excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes acquisitions divestitures transfers between business units fiduciary investment income reimbursable expenses and certain unusual items supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they may not make identical adjustments reconciliations of this nongaap measure organic revenue growth percentages to the reported commissions fees and other revenue growth percentages have been provided under the review by segment caption below 

adjusted operating margin 

we use adjusted operating margin as a nongaap measure of core operating performance of our risk solutions and hr solutions segments adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items including restructuring charges intangible asset amortization and headquarters relocation costs because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance this supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the reported operating margin is as follows in millions 







 adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we also use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of restructuring charges intangible asset amortization and headquarters relocation costs along with related income taxes because management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings this supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

reconciliations of this nongaap measure to the reported diluted earnings per share are as follows in millions except per share data 







free cash flow 

we use free cash flow defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance this supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto the use of this nongaap measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows in millions 

impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

because we conduct business in more than 120 countries foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating last years revenue expenses and net income using current years foreign exchange rates using this illustrative methodology currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of 011 003 and 006 during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively on adjusted net income per diluted share when we translate prior year results at current year end foreign exchange rates these translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases restructuring initiatives funding pension obligations and shareholder dividends we believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including principal and interest payments on debt obligations capital expenditures pension contributions cash restructuring costs and anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes as well as amounts restricted as to their use funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in fiduciary assets in the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding amount in fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds generally cannot be used for general corporate purposes and are not a source of liquidity for us 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased   232 million  to 768 million  in 2014  during 2014  cash flow from operating activities increased   9 million  to 16 billion  additional sources of funds in 2014  included net sales of short term investments of 110 million  48 million  of proceeds from the sale of businesses and issuances of debt net of repayments  of 13 billion  the primary uses of funds in 2014  included share repurchases of 23 billion  cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans of 316 million acquisition of businesses of 479 million  dividends paid to shareholders of 273 million  and capital expenditures of 256 million  

our investment grade rating is important to us for a number of reasons the most important of which is preserving our financial flexibility if our credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade the interest expense on any outstanding balances on our credit facilities would increase and we could incur additional requests for pension contributions to manage unforeseen situations we have committed credit lines of approximately 12 billion  and we endeavor to manage our obligations to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings at december 31 2014  we had no borrowings on these credit lines 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2014   increased   9 million  or 1  to 16 billion  the increase  from the prior year was primarily driven by higher  net income adjusted for noncash items of 170 million  and a reduction in pension contributions of 162 million  from the prior year partially offset by organic growth and significant receivable collections in the prior year period a larger decrease  in accounts payables and accrued liabilities of 129 million  and a 98 million  increase in payments for restructuring reserves 

the primary uses of the cash from operating activities in 2014  were pension contributions net of expense of 340 million  a decrease  in restructuring reserves of 83 million  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 81 million  partially offset by net income adjusted for noncash items of 22 billion  and a decrease  in accounts receivable of 25 million  pension contributions net of expenses were 340 million  during 2014  compared to 502 million  during 2013  in 2015  we expect to contribute approximately 220 million  to our pension plans with the majority attributable to nonus pension plans which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates in 2015  we also expect to have cash payments related to restructuring plans of 31 million  

we expect cash generated by operations for 2014  to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations fund the cash requirements of our restructuring programs finance capital expenditures continue purchases of shares under our share repurchase program and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities we have the ability to borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows we have committed credit facilities of approximately 12 billion  of which all was available at december 31 2014  and can access these facilities on a same day or next day basis additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed 

investing activities 

cash flow used for  investing activities in 2014  was 545 million  the primary drivers of the cash flow used for  investing activities were 479 million  for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired and 256 million  for capital expenditures partially offset by net sales  of shortterm investments of 110 million  sale of businesses of 48 million  and 32 million  for net sales  of longterm investments the cash flows provided by the net sales  of longterm investments represent the cash proceeds generated from net sales  of longterm investments where the corresponding gains and losses are recognized in other income  in the condensed consolidated statements of income in 2015 we expect to have cash payments of 270 million related to capital expenditures

review by segment 

general 

we serve clients through the following segments 

 

 risk solutions 



the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units and is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values during 2014  pricing was flat on average globally and we would still consider this to be a soft market in a soft market premium rates flatten or decrease along with commission revenues due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds 

additionally continuing through 2014  we faced difficult conditions as a result of continued weakness in the global economy the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets weak economic conditions in many markets around the globe have reduced our customers demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products which have had a negative impact on our operational results 

risk solutions generated approximately 65  of our consolidated total revenues in 2014  revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients policy renewals the net effect of new and lost business the timing of services provided to our clients and the income we earn on investments which is heavily influenced by shortterm interest rates

the method used to recognize workforce reduction costs depends on whether the benefits are provided under a onetime benefit arrangement or under an ongoing benefit arrangement we account for relevant expenses as an ongoing benefit arrangement when we have an established termination benefit policy statutory requirements dictate the termination benefit amounts or we have an established pattern of providing similar termination benefits the method to estimate the amount of termination benefits is based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated 

in most cases workforce reductions are made pursuant to an ongoing arrangement we recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from an ongoing benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated and notify the employees 

although it occurs less frequently when a workforce reduction is made pursuant to a onetime benefit arrangement we recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from a onetime benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated notify the employees and expect to terminate the employees within the legally required notification period when employees receive incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period we recognize the cost of their termination benefits over the remaining service period 

lease termination costs 

where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or vacated space and have no intention of reoccupying it we recognize a loss and corresponding liability the liability reflects our best estimate of the fair value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement to determine the loss and corresponding liability we estimate sublease income based on all information that is reasonably available which typically includes current market quotes for similar properties 

useful lives on leasehold improvements or other assets associated with lease abandonments may be revised to reflect a shorter useful life than originally estimated which results in accelerated depreciation 

fair value concepts of severance arrangements and lease losses 

accounting guidance requires that the liabilities recorded related to our restructuring activities be measured at fair value 

where material we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their present value most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time and therefore no discounting is necessary however we may discount the termination benefit arrangement when we terminate employees who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period the discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate which matches the lifetime of the liability significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded 

other associated costs with restructuring activities 

we recognize other costs associated with restructuring activities as they are incurred including moving costs and consulting and legal fees 

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada our significant us uk netherlands and canadian pension plans are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our us uk and canadian plans in 2014 the netherlands ceased crediting future benefits relating to service but will continue to apply future salary increases to past service 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life 

expectancy of the us the netherlands canada and uk plan members we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2014  our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2015  amortization of loss by country amounts in millions 

the unrecognized prior service cost at december 31 2014  was 11 million 22 million and 3 million in the us uk and other plans 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current years value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2014  the marketrelated value of assets was 20 billion  we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2014  the fair value of plan assets was 20 billion  

our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix as of december 31 2014  

 in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we surveyed multiple third party financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the actual asset allocation at december 31 2014  was 61 equity and 39 fixed income securities for the qualified plan 

the investment policy for each uk and nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and nonus category our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan further target allocations are subject to change as of december 31 2014  the uk and nonus plans were invested between 22 and 34 in equity and between 78 and 66 in fixed income securities 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a twenty five basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2014  in millions 

 holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a twenty five basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our estimated 2015  pension expense in millions 

holding other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a twenty five basis point increase and decrease in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2015  pension expense in millions 

estimated future contributions 

we estimate contributions of approximately 220 million  in 2015  as compared with 316 million  in 2014  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either tradenames customer relationships technology noncompete agreements or other purchased intangibles 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we also test the acquired tradenames which also are not amortized for impairment we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others no events occurred during 2014  that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component 

constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components is a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

the goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value including goodwill of the corresponding reporting unit if the more likely than not threshold is not met then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two step analysis step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step two step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow dcf model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weightedaverage cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry based on tests performed in both 2014  and 2013  there was no indication of goodwill impairment and no further testing was required 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2014  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

restricted share units 

restricted share units rsus are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable 

performance share awards 

performance share awards psas are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

compensation cost is recognized over the performance period the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest performancebased sharebased payment award plan is the leadership performance plan lpp which has a threeyear performance period the 2012 to 2014 performance period ended on december 31 2014 the 2011 to 2013 performance period ended on december 31 2013 the 2010 to 2012 performance period ended on december 31 2012 and the 2009 to 2011 performance period ended on december 31 2011 the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2013 to 2015 and 2014 to 2016 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both lpp plans would have increased our 2014  expense by approximately 19 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 60 million as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries the estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results in the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized or expected to be recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item such as the resolution of prioryear tax matters 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on managements assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in this assessment significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a more likely than not determination we have not recognized a us deferred tax liability for permanently reinvested earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries additional us income taxes could be recorded or incurred if we change our investment strategy relating to these subsidiaries which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

we base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on managements interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate managements assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

we operate in many jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed in such jurisdictions we typically obtain professional guidance when available and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations in addition several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities including the following

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks see note 2 summary of significant accounting principles and practices of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we use overthecounter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in us dollars and euros but most of their expenses are incurred in british pounds at december 31 2014  we have hedged approximately 45 and 81 of our uk subsidiaries expected us dollar transaction exposure for the years ending december 31 2015  and 2016  respectively in addition we have hedged 81 of our uk subsidiaries expected euro transaction exposures for the same time periods we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and shortterm assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 28 million and 19 million at december 31 2015  and 2016  respectively 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the us and on the continent of europe a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 17 million and 34 million to 2015  and 2016  pretax income respectively a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 47 million and 47 million to 2015  and 2016  pretax income respectively 

we have longterm debt outstanding with a fair market value of 53 billion  and 39 billion  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively this fair value was greater than  the carrying value by 469 million  at december 31 2014  and 208 million   greater than  the carrying value at december 31 2013  a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by approximately 8 or 10 respectively at december 31 2014  and 2013  

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors set forth below reflect certain risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain forwardlooking statements as discussed in the business section of part i item 1 of this report readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur 

the following are certain risks related to our businesses specifically and the industries in which we operate generally that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forwardlooking statements in this document and elsewhere these risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence 

risks relating to the company generally 

competitive risks 

an overall decline in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our businesses 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our risk solutions business 

the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values downward fluctuations in the yearoveryear insurance premium charged by insurers to protect against the same risk referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market could adversely affect our risk solutions business as a significant portion of the earnings are determined as a percentage of premium charged to our clients a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business or by exposing us to errors and omissions claims referred to here as eo claims 

the results of our hr solutions business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve economic downturns in some markets may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients which may result in reductions in the growth of new business as well as reductions in existing business if our clients become financially less stable enter bankruptcy or liquidate their operations our revenues andor collectibility of receivables could be adversely affected in addition our revenues from many of our outsourcing contracts depend upon the number of our clients employees or the number of participants in our clients employee benefit plans and could be adversely affected by layoffs we may also experience decreased demand for our services as a result of postponed or terminated outsourcing of human resources functions or reductions in the size of our clients workforce reduced demand for our services could increase price competition some portion of our services may be considered by our clients to be more discretionary in nature and thus demand for these services may be impacted by reductions in economic activity 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

we believe that competition in our risk solutions segment is based on service product features price commission structure financial strength and ability to access certain insurance markets and name recognition in particular we compete with a large number of national regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers 

our hr solutions segment competes with a large number of independent firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world many of our competitors in this area are expanding the services they offer or reducing prices in an attempt to gain additional business additionally some competitors have established and are likely to continue to establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs 

our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases greater name recognition stronger presence in certain geographies and more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have in addition new competitors alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop large and wellcapitalized competitors may be able to respond to the need for technological changes and innovate faster or price their services more aggressively they may also compete for skilled professionals finance acquisitions fund internal growth and compete for market share more effectively than we do to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure we may have to lower the cost of our services or decrease the level of service provided to clients which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

financial risks 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

we face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our functional currency the us dollar as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the united states these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows our five largest nonus dollar exposures are the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and indian rupee however we also have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have significant currency volatility these currency exchange risks are present in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as well as those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies which can reduce the reduced profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move a decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can as a result deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

operating funds available for corporate use and funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were 10 billion and 38 billion respectively at december 31 2013 these funds are reported in cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and fiduciary assets we also carry an investment portfolio of other longterm investments as of december 31 2013 these longterm investments had a carrying value of 132 million changes in interest rates and counterparty credit quality including default could reduce the value of these funds and investments thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results for example changes in interest rates directly affect our income from cash balances and shortterm investments similarly general economic conditions stock market conditions financial stability of the investees and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our longterm investments our cash holdings including cash held in our fiduciary capacity are subject to the credit liquidity and other risks faced by our financial institution counterparties 

while we regularly measure monitor and mitigate our exposure to these risks a deterioration in the credit or liquidity of any of these counterparties particularly if sudden or severe could in turn adversely affect us we also assess our portfolio for otherthantemporary impairments for investments in which the fair value is less than the carrying value and the impairment is deemed to be otherthantemporary we recognize a loss in the consolidated statement of income 

higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the company 

our pension obligations could adversely affect our shareholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity 

to the extent that the pension obligations associated with our major plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected in certain years there have been declines in interest rates as a result of lower interest rates and investment returns the present value of plan liabilities could increase faster than the value of plan assets resulting in higher unfunded positions in several of our major pension plans 

we currently plan to contribute approximately 385 million to our major pension plans in 2014 although we may elect to contribute more total cash contributions to these pension plans in 2013 were 523 million which was a decrease of 115 million compared to 2012 

the significance of our worldwide pension plans means that our pension contributions and expense are comparatively sensitive to various market and demographic factors these factors include equity and bond market returns the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities foreign exchange rates rates of inflation mortality assumptions potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts including annuities variations in any of these factors could cause significant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year 

the periodic revision of pension assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic pension expense or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions as a result there can be no assurance that we will not experience future changes in the funded status of our plans shareholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those that have been estimated 

we have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2013 we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately 44 billion the level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility we also bear risk at the time debt matures 

we have two primary committed credit facilities outstanding one with us banks and the other with european banks the us facility totals 400 million and matures in march 2017 the euro facility totals €650 million 890 million based on exchange rates at december 31 2013 and matures in october 2015 both the us facility and the euro facility are intended as a backup against commercial paper and for our general working capital needs at december 31 2013 we had no borrowings under either of these credit facilities both facilities require certain representations and warranties to be made before drawing and both have similar financial covenants at december 31 2013 we could make all representations and warranties and were in compliance with all financial covenants 

a substantial portion of our outstanding debt including certain intercompany debt obligations contains financial and other covenants the terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain or increase the costs of obtaining additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures additional acquisitions or general corporate requirements this in turn 

may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to make interest and principal payments to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control it will also reduce the availability to use that cash for other purposes including working capital dividends to shareholders share repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 

if we cannot service our indebtedness we may have to take actions such as selling assets seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments and alliances any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business additionally we may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs access to capital and financial flexibility 

a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital and reduce our financial flexibility our senior debt ratings at december 31 2013 were a with a stable outlook standard  poors bbb with a stable outlook fitch inc and baa2 with a positive outlook moodys investor services our commercial paper ratings were a2 sp f2 fitch and p2 moodys during 2013 standard  poors upgraded their rating of our senior longterm debt from bbb to a additionally moodys investor services changed their outlook from stable to positive 

our credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure and other factors on any trading market for or trading value of our securities in addition real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings which could result from any number of factors including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers will generally affect any trading market for or trading value of our securities 

the economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects for growth 

our operations in countries undergoing political change or economic downturns are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business these risks include particularly in emerging markets the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems unstable governments and economies and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods services and currency in addition our european operations could experience detrimental uncertainty if the debt crisis worsens or financial market volatility there increases and the region’s commerce and business levels become impacted by questions surrounding certain countries’ ability to satisfy their debt obligations the future of the eurozone and the stability of economic conditions in europe and the value of the euro generally 

seemingly nationally or regionally localized political and economic changes could have a wider negative impact on our businesses that expands beyond our operations in the immediately affected jurisdiction the continued concerns regarding the ability of certain european countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets this instability has in turn led to questions regarding the future viability of the euro as the common currency for the area as various scenarios could result in some countries choosing to return to their former local currencies in an effort to regain control over their domestic economies and monetary policies this uncertainty has had a dampening effect on growth potential in europe and if it deteriorates may have a material negative impact on our european business as well as that of our clients further any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets or profitability denominated in that currency potentially result in charges to our statement of operations and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our euro credit facility we also deposit some of our cash including cash held in a fiduciary capacity with certain european financial institutions while we continuously monitor and manage exposures associated with those deposits to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in europe and the future viability of the euro currency suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk 

the expected benefits of our redomestication may not be realized or may be offset in whole or in part by related costs 

there can be no assurance that all of the goals of our redomestication will be achievable particularly as the achievement of the benefits are in many important respects subject to factors that we do not control these factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors analysts and uk and us taxing authorities 

our effective tax rates and the benefits anticipated from our redomestication are also subject to a variety of other factors many of which are beyond our ability to control such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the uk and the us and other countries the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions currency exchange rate fluctuations especially as between the british pound and the us dollar and significant changes in trade monetary or fiscal policies of the uk or the us including changes in interest rates the impact of these factors individually and in the aggregate is difficult to predict in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be and in fact often seem to be interrelated and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or alternatively reduced offset or more than offset by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors 

our redomestication resulted in an increase in some of our ongoing expenses including those related to complying with uk corporate and tax laws and holding board meetings in the uk these additional expenses could serve to reduce or offset the benefits realized from our redomestication 

on september 4 2013 we received from the internal revenue service “irs” an executed closing agreement pursuant to which the company and the irs agreed that the merger pursuant to which the redomestication occurred did not cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes this agreement substantially reduces the risk that actions taken to date might cause aon plc to be treated as a us domestic corporation for federal tax purposes under the current tax statute and regulations however the united states congress the irs the united kingdom parliament or uk tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a nonus corporation or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position retroactive statutory or regulatory actions have occurred in the past and there can be no assurance that any such provisions if enacted or promulgated would not have retroactive application to us the redomestication or any subsequent actions our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we were to be subject to us corporate income tax as a domestic corporation in addition any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between the united kingdom and other jurisdictions including the united states or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties could subject us to increased taxation 

hm revenue and customs or hmrc may disagree with our conclusions on the uk tax treatment of our redomestication or relevant uk legislation may be subject to change 

we have obtained a ruling from hmrc that following our redomestication the temporary period exemption from the uks controlled foreign company rules will apply such that subject to certain conditions and limitations based on our facts and circumstances we will not be subject to tax on the profits of any controlled company that is resident in a foreign jurisdiction under the controlled foreign company cfc rules until 24 months after the end of the accounting period in which the redomestication occurred subject to any changes of legislation on march 29 2012 the uk government published the finance no 4 bill which proposed major reforms to the cfc rules for accounting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 the proposed transitional rules would preserve the temporary period exemption for exempt periods beginning before the new rules come into force while hmrc cannot provide any assurance in respect of the application of legislation that has not been enacted we are of the view based on the governments proposals and published draft legislation that the new cfc rules should not have a material adverse effect on our tax treatment in the uk if enacted in their current form however to the extent that the finance no 4 bill is enacted in a form different to that currently proposed this may result in additional corporation tax liabilities becoming payable following implementation of the revised legislation 

we have also obtained a ruling from hmrc in respect of the stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax sdrt consequences of the redomestication and as a result believe that we have satisfied all stamp duty and sdrt payment and filing obligations in connection with the issuance of class a ordinary shares issued in connection with our redomestication 

further if hmrc disagrees with our view of any issues in respect of which no ruling has been obtained it may take the position that material uk corporation tax or sdrt liabilities or amounts on account thereof are payable by any one or more of these companies as a result of our redomestication in which case we expect that we would contest such assessment to contest such assessment we may be required to remit cash or provide security of the amount in dispute or such lesser amount as permitted under uk law and acceptable to hmrc to prevent hmrc from seeking enforcement actions pending the dispute of such assessment if we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment the implications could be materially adverse to us to the extent that hmrc has not provided and we have not requested a ruling on the uk tax aspects of the redomestication 

there can be no assurance that hmrc will agree with our interpretation of the uk tax aspects of our redomestication or any related matters associated therewith 

our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors which could create volatility in that rate expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the uk us and many other jurisdictions as a result our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the transfer pricing of revenues and costs acquisitions and dispositions and the portion of the income of nonus subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities 

we believe that our redomestication and related transactions should significantly improve our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the uk has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject nonuk earnings to uk tax when such earnings are repatriated to the uk in the form of dividends from nonuk subsidiaries this should allow us to optimize our capital allocation and deploy efficient fiscal structures however we cannot provide any assurances as to what our tax rate will be in any period because of among other things uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions as well as changes in us and other tax laws treaties and regulations our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of the uk and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our tax rate 

we also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods as would any reclassification or other matter such as changes in applicable accounting rules that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law audits and other matters our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer 

changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those relating to restructuring pensions recoverability of assets including customer receivables contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially affect the consolidated statements of income comprehensive income financial position shareholders equity and cash flows changes in accounting standards could also have an adverse impact on our future consolidated financial statements 

we may be required to record goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges which could result in a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles we review our longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry there can be no assurances that goodwill or other longlived asset impairment charges will not be required in the future which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

our principal assets are the shares of capital stock and indebtedness of our subsidiaries we rely on dividends interest and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligation paying dividends to shareholders repurchasing ordinary shares and corporate expenses certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts 

that these subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us no assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law regulatory actions or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in addition due to differences in tax rates repatriation of funds from certain countries into the uk through the us could have unfavorable tax ramifications for us furthermore no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to eo claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings some of which if determined unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of a business line or the company as a whole 

we assist our clients with various matters including placing of insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims consulting on various human resources matters providing investment consulting and asset management services and outsourcing various human resources functions eo claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services eo claims could include for example the failure of our employees or sub agents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured the failure to give errorfree advice in our consulting business or the failure to correctly execute transactions in the human resources outsourcing business it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition we are subject to other types of claims litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business which along with eo claims may seek damages including punitive damages in amounts that could if awarded have a material adverse impact on the companys financial position earnings and cash flows in addition to potential liability for monetary damages such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

we have historically purchased and intend to continue to purchase insurance to cover eo claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters however we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and consequently are selfinsured or materially selfinsured for some historical claims accruals for these exposures and related insurance receivables when applicable have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable these accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income discussion of some of these claims lawsuits and proceedings are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the ultimate outcome of these claims lawsuits and proceedings cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us it is possible that future statements of financial position results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

in addition we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others the maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods any anticipated amounts that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable are included in our consolidated financial statements these amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments if any for these guarantees and indemnifications 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability limit our growth or increase competition 

our businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world including the uk companies act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the fca the us securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and a variety of other laws rules and regulations addressing among other things licensing data privacy and protection wageandhour standards employment and labor relations anticompetition anticorruption currency reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries this legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance by limiting or restricting the products or services we sell the markets we enter the methods by which we sell our products and services or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients carriers and third parties or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions or proceedings 

the global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations including training and employee expenses adding to our cost of doing business in addition many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance in 

emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected 

certain laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act “fatca” in the us and the bribery act of 2010 “uk bribery act” in the uk impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations and in a number of cases requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries for example in 2011 we entered into settlement agreements with the us department of justice doj and the us securities and exchange commission sec relating to inadequate controls for potential fcpa violations those settlement agreements imposed monetary fines and the agreement with the doj required that we bring to the attention of the doj any criminal conduct by or criminal investigations of aon or any of its senior managerial employees as well as any administrative proceeding or civil action brought by any governmental authority that alleges fraud or corruption by aon 

we expect that facta will likely result in increased compliance costs fatca will require certain of our subsidiaries affiliates and other entities to obtain valid fatca documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees in the event we do not obtain valid fatca documents we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments this obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply in whole or in part in such circumstances we may incur fatca compliance costs including withholding taxes interest and penalties in addition regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under fatca may increase our costs of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries which could adversely affect our operations results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves the development of new laws and regulations changes in application or interpretation of laws and regulations and our continued operational changes and development into new jurisdictions and new service offerings also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject these changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services furthermore as we enter new jurisdictions or lines of businesses and other developments in our services we may become subject to additional types of laws and policies and governmental oversight and supervision such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may have a license revoked be unable to obtain new licenses and be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past 

in addition new regulatory or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us these developments include 

 changes in the regulatory scheme or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance likewise increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

with respect to our risk solutions segment our business’ regulatory oversight generally also includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents managing general agency or managing general underwriting operations and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies for instance if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client further regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations 

services provided in our hr solutions segment are also the subject of everevolving government regulation either because the services provide to our clients are regulated directly or because aspects of the clients business are regulated thereby indirectly impacting the manner in which we provide services to those clients changes in government regulations in the united states affecting the value use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare such as medical plans defined contribution such as 401k plans defined benefit such as pension plans or payroll delivery may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services recently we have seen regulatory initiatives contribute to companies either discontinuing their defined benefit programs or deemphasizing the importance such programs play in the overall mix of their benefit programs with a trend toward increased use of defined contribution plans if organizations discontinue or deemphasize defined benefit plans more rapidly than we anticipate the results of our business could be adversely affected 

recently our hr solutions business has made significant investments in health care exchanges and other product development to assist clients in derisking their health benefits and migrate them towards a defined contribution model versus a defined benefit model depending on future changes to health legislation these investments may not yield returns in addition if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from these laws and any subsequent regulations our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services particularly in the hr solutions segment could be negatively impacted furthermore if our clients reduce the role or extent of employersponsored health care in response to the newly enacted legislation our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

if we violate the laws and regulation to which we are subject we could be subject to fines penalties or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations causing an adverse effect on our operations and condition 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others could harm our reputation ability to compete effectively and financial condition 

to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates clients strategic partners and others in addition the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights further effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services or competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively 

in addition to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement suits or interference proceedings third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us which may be costly to defend could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies products or other intellectual property any intellectual property claims with or without merit could be expensive take significant time and divert managements attention from other business concerns successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others or require us to purchase licenses from third parties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of increased shareholder approval requirements we have less flexibility as an english public limited company with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

english law imposes some restrictions on certain corporate actions by which previously as a delaware corporation we were not constrained for example english law provides that a board of directors may only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution this authorization would 

need to be renewed by our shareholders upon its expiration ie at least every five years our articles of association authorize the allotment of additional shares and renewal of such authorization for additional five year terms may be sought more frequently 

english law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash however it is possible for the articles of association or shareholders in general meeting to exclude preemptive rights such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the articles of association if the exclusion is contained in the articles of association or from the date of the shareholder resolution if the exclusion is by shareholder resolution in either case this exclusion would need to be renewed upon its expiration ie at least every five years our articles of association exclude preemptive rights and renewal of such exclusion for additional five year terms may be sought more frequently 

english law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of off market purchases without the prior approval of our shareholders such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years our shares are traded on the nyse which is not a recognized investment exchange in the uk consequently any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an “off market purchase” resolutions were adopted to permit such purchases prior to the redomestication these resolutions will need to be renewed upon expiration ie at least every five years but may be sought more frequently for additional five year terms 

the enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult 

because we are a public limited company incorporated under english law investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in us courts than would have been the case for us judgments obtained against aon corporation in addition it may be more difficult or impossible to bring some types of claims against us in courts in england than it would be to bring similar claims against a us company in a us court 

we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales therefore it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the united states in order to enforce judgments of us courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 

there is doubt as to the enforceability in england and wales in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts of civil liabilities solely based on the us federal securities laws the english courts will however treat any amount payable by us under the us judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the english courts to enforce this debt against us the following criteria must be satisfied in order for the english court to enforce the debt created by the us judgment 

 operational and commercial risks 

our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced and qualified personnel including our senior management team and other professional personnel 

we depend in material part upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy the unexpected loss of services of any of our senior executive officers could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy competition for experienced professional personnel is intense and we are constantly working to retain and attract these professionals if we cannot successfully do so our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

our operations are conducted globally accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in and sourcing from foreign countries including 

 the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters including earthquakes hurricanes fires floods and tornadoes and pandemic health events as well as manmade disasters including acts of terrorism and military actions the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and a natural or manmade disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster these consequences could among other things result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas they could also result in reduced underwriting capacity making it more difficult for our risk solutions professionals to place business disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure including communications and financial services which could disrupt our normal business operations 

a natural or manmade disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us in addition a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio finally a natural or manmade disaster could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims against us 

as an example in october 2012 superstorm sandy made landfall on the northeast coast of the united states the storm caused widespread disruption and dislocation across five states but new york and new jersey in particular one of our largest offices located in lower manhattan was closed until january 7 2013 requiring us to relocate a large number of our employees to temporary workspace in the area and provide for enhanced remote working and information technology support arrangements given that lower manhattan serves as a hub to the insurance industry the storm impacted many of our clients carriers and vendors as well some of whose operations were severely disrupted while we believe our relocation measures and business continuity plans allowed us to effectively continue to operate our critical business functions it is possible that the disruption of the storm on our operations and that of our clients carriers and vendors may have resulted in a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

also through our merger with benfield we acquired benfields equity stake in certain floridadomiciled homeowner insurance companies we maintain ongoing agreements to provide modeling actuarial and consulting services to these insurance companies these firms financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing their underwriting reserves differ from actual experience reserve estimates represent informed judgments based on currently available data as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events such as changes in claims handling procedures inflation judicial and legal developments and legislative changes can cause estimates to vary additionally a natural disaster occurring in florida could increase the incidence or severity of eo claims relating to these existing service agreements 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane terrorist attack pandemic security breaches power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our continued success will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations superstorm sandy for example impacted several of our locations in the northeast united states resulting in interruptions to our operations and information technology system 

infrastructure in events like these while our operational size the multiple locations from which we operate and our existing backup systems provide us with some degree of flexibility we still can experience nearterm operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel 

our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario 

we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption or breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation operations sales and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within the company and some are outsourced all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to computer viruses security breaches energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly 

we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents which to date have not had a material impact on our business in the future these types of incidents could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen including client employee or company data we may not be able to detect breaches in our information technology systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions but a security breach or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients adversely impact our operations sales and operating results and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation 

one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees and clients confidential and proprietary information and in the case of our hr solutions clients the personal data of their employees and retirement and other benefit plan participants we maintain policies procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information nonetheless we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

further data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability this makes compliance challenging and expensive our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace further regulatory initiatives in the area of data privacy are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties and therefore failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact 

implementation of changes to the methods in which we internally process and monitor transactions and activities may encounter delays or other problems which could adversely impact our accounting and financial reporting processes 

our businesses require that we process and monitor on a regular basis a very large number of transactions and other activities many of which are highly complex across numerous markets in several different currencies using different systems initiatives underway that are designed to improve these functions will alter how we gather organize and internally report these transactions and activities to the extent these initiatives are not implemented properly or we encounter problems or delays in 

their implementation they may adversely impact our accounting and financial reporting processes as well as our invoicing and collection efforts 

our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technologybased solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools conversely investments in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investments 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology industry standards and client preferences we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and costeffective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace additionally the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more costeffective technologies it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements for example we have invested significantly in the development of grip a repository of global insurance placement information which we use to drive better results for our clients in the insurance placement process our competitors are seeking to develop competing databases and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions likewise we have invested significantly in our hr bpo business and platform innovations in software cloud computing or other technologies that alter how these services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in this business if we are slow or unable to take advantage of these developments 

on the other hand we are continually developing and investing in innovative and novel product offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the markets nevertheless for those efforts to produce meaningful value we are reliant on a number of other factors some of which our outside of our control for example our hr solutions segment has invested substantial time and resources in launching health care exchanges under the belief that these exchanges will serve a useful role in helping corporations and individuals in the us manage their growing health care expenses but in order for these exchanges to be successful health care insurers and corporate and individual participants have to deem them suitable to participate in and whether those parties will find them suitable will be subject to their own particular circumstances 

if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services we may face additional cost loss of profit opportunities and damage to our reputation or legal liability 

we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for highquality brokering risk management and hr solutions so that we can understand our clients needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to satisfy these needs if a client is not satisfied with our services it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses and could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups andor trade associations and actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors accordingly poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients moreover if we fail to meet our contractual obligations we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 

the nature of much of our work especially our actuarial services in our hr solutions business involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance similarly in our investment consulting business we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given in addition we could make computational software programming or data entry or management errors a client may nonetheless claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice and in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business 

damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation is a key asset of the company we advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones as mentioned above   negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us in any number of activities or circumstances including operations regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems satisfaction of client expectations and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct this 

damage to our reputation could further affect the confidence of our clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business having a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide services data and information such as technology information security fund transfer data processing and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business these third parties include correspondents agents and other brokerage and intermediaries insurance markets data providers plan trustees payroll service providers software and system vendors health plan providers investment managers investment advisers and providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers among others as we do not fully control the actions of these third parties we are subject to the risk that their decisions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense a failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause harm to our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties liability claims from clients andor employees damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds 

our risk solutions business collects premiums from insureds and after deducting commissions remits the premiums to the respective insurers we also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds which are remitted to the insureds similarly part of our hr solutions outsourcing business handles payroll processing for several of our clients consequently at any given time we may be holding and managing funds of our clients and in the case of hr solutions their employees while payroll is being processed this function creates a risk of loss arising from among other things fraud by employees or third parties execution of unauthorized transactions or errors relating to transaction processing we are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event the occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm 

in connection with the implementation of our corporate strategy we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses and the entry into new lines of business 

in pursuing our corporate strategy we may acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own the success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions if acquisitions are made there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions including but not limited to revenue growth operational efficiencies or expected synergies in addition we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies which may impact our results of operations if we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets 

from time to time we may enter lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts including the investment of significant time and resources the possibility that these efforts will be unprofitable and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business in addition we can provide no assurance that the entry into new lines of business or development of new products and services will be successful 

we may face additional risks from the growth and development of companies that we acquire or new lines of business 

we face additional risks associated with companies that we acquire or new lines of business into which we enter particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in addition many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses including improving refining or revising our systems and 

operational practices and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses our business may be adversely affected other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business recruiting professionals and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses successfully could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the process of integrating an acquired company may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 

companies that we acquire often run on one or more technology platforms different from those used in our businesses when integrating these businesses we face additional risks these risks include implementing or remediating controls procedures and policies at the acquired company ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements integration of the acquired companys accounting human resource and other administrative systems and coordination of product engineering and sales and marketing functions transition of operations users and customers onto our existing platforms and the failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights to retain such employees and integrate the acquired business we may offer additional retention incentives but it may still be difficult to retain certain key employees 

risks relating primarily to our risk solutions segment 

results in our risk solutions segment may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control 

results in our risk solutions segment have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate a significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage we have no control over premium rates and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction the potential for changes in premium rates is significant due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets 

in addition to movements in premium rates our ability to generate premiumbased commission revenue may be challenged by 

 in addition our increasing focus on new product offerings within the risk solutions space exposes us to additional risks for example grip is a relatively new and historically untested offering it may fail to catch on within the insurance industry or conversely if successful may face increasing pressure from competitors who develop competing offerings as our business like the economy as a whole becomes more technology focused the speed at which our products are subject to challenge or becoming outdated is consistently increasing 

our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry 

since the attorney general of new york brought charges against members of the insurance brokerage community in 2004 there has been uncertainty concerning longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers given that the insurance brokerage industry has faced scrutiny from regulators in the past over its compensation practices it is possible that those regulators may choose to revisit the same or other practices in the future if they do so compliance with new regulations along 

with any sanctions that might be imposed for past practices deemed improper could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations and inflict significant reputational harm on our business 

risks relating primarily to our hr solutions segment 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of hewitt or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

the acquisition and integration of a company the size of hewitt is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we have devoted and continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating hewitts business practices and operations with ours as described further below we have closed the global restructuring plan related to our acquisition of hewitt but a failure by us to further meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating hewitts operations with ours or to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of our activities preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us for the acquisition and seriously harm our results of operations and cash flows in addition the overall integration of the two companies may result in material unanticipated problems including among others 

 many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and cash flows and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if hewitts operations are integrated successfully with our operations we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the price of our ordinary shares as a result we cannot assure you that the acquisition of hewitt will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction 

in 2010 after completion of the acquisition of hewitt we announced a global restructuring plan referred to as the aon hewitt plan the aon hewitt plan which closed in december 2013 was intended to streamline operations across the combined organization and facilitate the integration of hewitt the aon hewitt plan resulted in cumulative costs of approximately 429 million through the end of the plan all of which are included in our consolidated statements of income primarily encompassing workforce reduction and real estate rationalization costs the total cost of 429 million consisted of approximately 266 million in employee termination costs and approximately 163 million in real estate rationalization costs approximately 2960 positions globally predominantly nonclient facing were eliminated as part of the aon hewitt plan we expect to achieve total annual savings of 402 million in 2014 of which 99 million is expected to be achieved in risk solutions and 303 million is expected to be achieved in hr solutions and additional savings in areas such as information technology procurement and public company costs we cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings 

the profitability of our outsourcing and consulting engagements with clients may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs cost overruns early contract terminations unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices 

in our hr solutions segment our profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency as we adapt to change in our business adapt to the regulatory environment enter into new engagements acquire additional businesses and take on new employees in new locations we may not be able to manage our large diverse and changing workforce control our costs or improve our efficiency 

most new outsourcing arrangements undergo an implementation process whereby our systems and processes are customized to match a clients plans and programs the cost of this process is estimated by us and often partially funded by our clients if our actual implementation expense exceeds our estimate or if the ongoing service cost is greater than anticipated the client contract may be less profitable than expected 

even though outsourcing clients typically sign longterm contracts some of these contracts may be terminated at any time with or without cause by our client upon 90 to 360 days written notice our outsourcing clients are generally required to pay a termination fee however this amount may not be sufficient to offset the costs we incurred in connection with the implementation and system setup or fully compensate us for the profit we would have received if the contract had not been cancelled a client may choose to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress such as the business or financial condition of the client or general economic conditions when any of our engagements are terminated we may not be able to eliminate associated ongoing costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the impact on profitability any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is largely a function of the rates we are able to charge for our services and the staffing costs for our personnel accordingly if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors including competitive factors cost of living adjustment provisions the extent of ongoing clients perception of our ability to add value through our services and general economic conditions our profitability in providing hr bpo services is largely based on our ability to drive cost efficiencies during the term of our contracts for such services if we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies our profit margins will suffer 

we might not be able to achieve the cost savings required to sustain and increase our profit margins in our hr solutions business 

we provide our outsourcing services over long terms for variable or fixed fees that generally are less than our clients historical costs to provide for themselves the services we contract to deliver also clients demand for cost reductions may increase over the term of the agreement as a result we bear the risk of increases in the cost of delivering hr outsourcing services to our clients and our margins associated with particular contracts will depend on our ability to control our costs of performance under those contracts and meet our service commitments costeffectively over time some of our operating expenses will increase as we invest in additional infrastructure and implement new technologies to maintain our competitive position and meet our client service commitments we must anticipate and respond to the dynamics of our industry and business by using quality systems process management improved asset utilization and effective supplier management tools we must do this while continuing to grow our business so that our fixed costs are spread over an increasing revenue base if we are not able to achieve this our ability to sustain and increase profitability may be reduced 

our accounting policy for our longterm outsourcing contracts requires using estimates and projections that may change over time these changes may have a significant or adverse effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition 

projecting contract profitability on the longterm outsourcing contracts in our hr solutions business requires us to make assumptions and estimates of future contract results all estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to change in an effort to maintain appropriate estimates we review each of our longterm outsourcing contracts the related contract reserves and intangible assets on a regular basis these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion which may also evolve over time in light of operational experience regulatory direction developments in accounting principles and other factors further changes in assumptions estimates or developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to longterm outsourcing contracts may change our initial estimates of future contract results application of and changes in assumptions estimates and policies may adversely affect our financial results 

in our investment consulting business we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments the results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors some of which are within our control and some which are not clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may assert claims against us 

our investment consulting business provides advice to clients on investment strategy which can include advice on setting investment objectives asset allocation and hedging strategies selection or removal of investment managers the investment in different investment instruments and products and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers for some clients we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciaryagency capacity albeit without assuming title or custody over the underlying funds or assets invested asset classes may experience poor absolute performance third parties we recommend or select such as 

investment managers may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance negligence or other reasons resulting in poor investment returns or losses of some or all of the capital that has been invested these losses may be attributable in whole or in part to failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control regardless of the cause clients experiencing losses may assert claims against us and these claims may be for significant amounts defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs including legal defense costs as well as cause substantial distraction and diversion of other resources furthermore our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciaryagency duties or other alleged errors or omissions 

we rely heavily on our computing and communications infrastructure and the integrity of these systems in the delivery of human resources services for our hr solutions clients and our operational performance and revenue growth depends in part on the reliability and functionality of this infrastructure as a means of delivering human resources services 

the internet is a key mechanism for delivering our human resources services to our hr solutions clients efficiently and cost effectively our clients may not be receptive to human resource services delivered over the internet due to concerns regarding transaction security user privacy the reliability and quality of internet service and other reasons our clients concerns may be heightened by the fact we use the internet to transmit extremely confidential information about our clients and their employees such as compensation medical information and other personally identifiable information in order to maintain the level of security service and reliability that our clients require we may be required to make significant additional investments in our online methods of delivering human resources services in addition websites and proprietary online services have experienced service interruptions and other delays occurring throughout their infrastructure if we cannot use the internet effectively to deliver our services our revenue growth and results of operation may be impaired 

we may lose client data as a result of major catastrophes and other similar problems that may materially adversely impact our operations we have multiple processing centers around the world that use various commercial methods for disaster recovery capabilities our main data processing center is located near the aon hewitt headquarters in lincolnshire illinois in the event of a disaster our business continuity may not be sufficient and the data recovered may not be sufficient for the administration of our clients human resources programs and processes 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

transfers of the class a ordinary shares may be subject to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk which would increase the cost of dealing in the class a ordinary shares 

stamp duty andor sdrt are imposed in the uk on certain transfers of chargeable securities which include shares in companies incorporated in the uk at a rate of 05 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 15 percent 

our class a ordinary shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of depository trust company dtc transfers of shares held in book entry form through dtc will not attract a charge to stamp duty or sdrt in the uk a transfer of the shares from within the dtc system out of dtc and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the dtc system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 05 percent of any consideration which is payable by the transferee of the shares any such duty must be paid and the relevant transfer document stamped by hmrc before the transfer can be registered in the books of aon uk if those shares are redeposited into dtc the redeposit will attract stamp duty or sdrt at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

we have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the dtc system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that sdrt may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository before the transfer can be registered in our books the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to sdrt which will be charged at a rate of 15 percent of the value of the shares 

following the decision of the first tier tribunal tax chamber in hsbc holdings plc the bank of new york mellon corporation v hmrc  2012 ukftt 163 tc and the announcement by hmrc that it will not seek to appeal the decision hmrc is no longer enforcing the charge to sdrt on the issue of shares into either eu or noneu depository receipt or clearance systems 

if the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of dtc then transactions in our securities may be disrupted 

the facilities of dtc are a widelyused mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the dtc system which include many large banks and brokerage firms we believe that prior to the merger approximately 99 of the outstanding shares of common stock of aon corporation were held within the dtc system the 

class a ordinary shares of aon plc are at present eligible for deposit and clearing within the dtc system in connection with the closing of the merger we entered into arrangements with dtc whereby we agreed to indemnify dtc for any stamp duty andor sdrt that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our class a ordinary shares in addition we have obtained a ruling from hmrc in respect of the stamp duty and sdrt consequences of the reorganization and sdrt has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of class a ordinary shares with the initial depository dtc will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the class a ordinary shares if dtc determines at any time that the class a ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe the class a ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a us securities exchange or inclusion in the sp 500 and trading in the class a ordinary shares would be disrupted while we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the class a ordinary shares

executive summary of 2013  financial results 

during 2013  we continued to face certain headwinds impacting our business in our risk solutions segment these headwinds included economic weakness in continental europe and a significant decline in investment income due to lower shortterm interest rates globally in our hr solutions segment these headwinds included price compression in our benefits administration business and competitive pressures across continental europe 

the following is a summary of our 2013  financial results 

 

 

 

 

 we focus on four key nongaap metrics that we communicate to shareholders grow organically expand adjusted margins increase adjusted diluted earnings per share and increase free cash flow the following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2013  

 

 

 30 

per share in 2013  an increase  of 068  per share or 16  from 421  per share in 2012  the increase  demonstrates solid operational performance and effective capital management despite a difficult business environment as well as the impact of 11 billion  of share repurchases during 2013  

 during 2013 we continued to execute against the strategic goals of the redomestication we believe the redomestication will continue to strengthen our long term strategy by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review of consolidated results 

general 

in our discussion of operating results we sometimes refer to certain nongaap supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted earnings per share free cash flow and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results 

organic revenue 

we use supplemental information related to organic revenue to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue is a nongaap measure and excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes acquisitions divestitures transfers between business units fiduciary investment income reimbursable expenses and certain unusual items supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they may not make identical adjustments reconciliation of this nongaap measure organic revenue growth percentages to the reported commissions fees and other revenue growth percentages has been provided in the review by segment caption below 

adjusted operating margin 

we use adjusted operating margin as a nongaap measure of core operating performance of our risk solutions and hr solutions segments adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items including restructuring charges intangible asset amortization and headquarters relocation costs this supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the reported operating margin is as follows in millions 





 adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we also use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of restructuring charges intangible asset amortization headquarters relocation costs hewitt related costs and other unusual items along with related income taxes this supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

reconciliations of this nongaap measure to the reported diluted earnings per share are as follows in millions except per share data 







free cash flow 

we use free cash flow defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures as a nongaap measure of our core operating performance this supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with us gaap and should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto the use of this nongaap measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures 

reconciliations of this nongaap measure to cash flow provided by operations are as follows in millions 

impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

because we conduct business in more than 120 countries foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business in comparison to the us dollar foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results the methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating last years revenue expenses and net income using current years foreign exchange rates using this illustrative methodology currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of 003 006 and favorable impact of 004 during the years ended december 31 2013  2012 and 2011 respectively on adjusted net income per diluted share when we translate prior year results at current year end foreign exchange rates these translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policy or practices for amounts included in the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and financial condition 

liquidity 

executive summary 

we believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with financial flexibility to create longterm value for our shareholders our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases restructuring initiatives funding pension obligations and shareholder dividends 

cash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes as well as amounts restricted as to their use funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in fiduciary assets in the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding amount in fiduciary liabilities fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes and are not a source of liquidity for us 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased   363 million  to 10 billion  in 2013  during 2013  cash flow from operating activities increased   214 million  to 16 billion  additional sources of funds in 2013  included 93 million  in sales of longterm investments and issuance of debt net of net of repayments of 227 million  the primary uses of funds in 2013  included share repurchases of 11 billion  cash contributions to our major defined benefit plans of 523 million capital expenditures of 229 million  dividends paid to shareholders of 212 million  and net purchases of short term investments of 174 million  

our investment grade rating is important to us for a number of reasons the most important of which is preserving our financial flexibility if our credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade the interest expense on any outstanding balances on our credit facilities would increase and we could incur additional requests for pension contributions to manage unforeseen situations we have committed credit lines of approximately 13 billion  and we manage our business to ensure we maintain our current investment grade ratings at december 31 2013  we had no borrowings on these credit lines 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2013   increased   214 million  to 16 billion  compared to 14 billion  in 2012  the primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net income of 11 billion  and adjustments for noncash items of 856 million  primarily related to depreciation amortization and stock compensation expense these items were partially offset by pension contributions of 523 million net cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by a 435 million settlement of a nonrecurring onetime legal matter pension contributions during 2013  were 523 million  compared to 638 million  in 2012  in 2014  we expect to contribute 385 million  to our pension plans with the majority attributable to nonus pension plans which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates in 2014  we also expect to have cash payments related to restructuring plans of 92 million  

we expect cash generated by operations for 2013  to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations fund the cash requirements of our restructuring programs finance capital expenditures continue purchases of shares under our share repurchase program and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these obligations we have the ability to borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows we have committed credit facilities of approximately 13 billion  of which all was available at december 31 2013  we can access these facilities on a same day or next day basis additionally under current market conditions we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longerterm funding if needed 

investing activities 

cash flow used for  investing activities in 2013  was 339 million  the primary drivers of the cash flow used for  investing activities were capital expenditures of 229 million  net purchases of short term investments of 174 million  acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired of 54 million  partially offset by sales of long term investments of 93 million

other countries due to differences in tax rates the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the us if repatriated could have an unfavorable tax impact 

in our capacity as an insurance broker or agent we collect premiums from insureds and after deducting our commission remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter we also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds which are then returned to the insureds unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity in addition some of our outsourcing agreements require us to hold funds on behalf of clients to pay obligations on their behalf the levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums claims and refunds make payments to underwriters and insureds collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf and foreign currency movements fiduciary assets because of their nature are required to be invested in very liquid securities with highlyrated creditworthy financial institutions in our consolidated statements of financial position the amount we report for fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal our fiduciary assets included cash and investments of 38 billion  and 40 billion and fiduciary receivables of 81 billion  and 82 billion at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively while we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments the cash and investments are not owned by us and cannot be used for general corporate purposes 

as disclosed in note 15 fair value measurements and financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds money market funds are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value consistent with market convention we consider cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value these money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions we do not believe that there are any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments 

as of december 31 2013  our investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments had a fair value of 21 billion  and are reported as shortterm investments or fiduciary assets in the consolidated statements of financial position depending on their nature and initial maturity 

the following table summarizes our fiduciary assets and nonfiduciary cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2013  in millions 

share repurchase program 

in april 2012 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which up to 5 billion of class a ordinary shares may be repurchased 2012 share repurchase program under this program shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time based on prevailing market conditions and will be funded from available capital

the major rating agencies ratings of our debt at february 18 2014  appear in the table below 

during 2013 standard  poors upgraded their rating of our senior longterm debt from bbb to a additionally moodys investor services changed their outlook from stable to positive a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs reduce or eliminate our access to capital reduce our financial flexibility increase our commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether or may impact future pension contribution requirements 

letters of credit and other guarantees 

we had total letters of credit locs outstanding for approximately 71 million  at december 31 2013  compared to 74 million  at december 31 2012  these letters of credit cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our us and canadian nonqualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers compensation program we also have issued locs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries

 financial condition 

at december 31 2013  our net assets of 82 billion  representing total assets minus total liabilities increased  from 78 billion  at december 31 2012  the increase  was due primarily to net income of 11 billion  for the year ended december 31 2013  a decrease  in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 236 million  related primarily to a decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation partially offset by share repurchases of 11 billion  and dividends of 212 million  working capital decreased  by 113 million  from 10 billion  at december 31 2012  to 919 million  at december 31 2013  

equity 

equity at december 31 2013  was 82 billion  an increase  of 390 million  from december 31 2012  the increase  resulted primarily from net income of 11 billion  a decrease  in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 236 million  partially offset by share repurchases of 11 billion  and 212 million  of dividends to shareholders 

the 236 million   decrease  in accumulated other comprehensive loss from december 31 2012  primarily reflects the following 

 

 

 

 

review by segment

we serve clients through the following segments 

 

 42 

risk solutions 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units and is most closely correlated with employment levels corporate revenue and asset values during 2013  we continued to see improvement in pricing on average globally however we would still consider this to be a soft market which began in 2007 in a soft market premium rates flatten or decrease along with commission revenues due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds in 2013  pricing showed signs of stabilization and improvement in our retail brokerage product lines 

additionally beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2013  we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets weak global economic conditions have reduced our customers demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage products which have had a negative impact on our operational results 

risk solutions generated approximately 66  of our consolidated total revenues in 2013  revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing of our clients policy renewals the net effect of new and lost business the timing of services provided to our clients and the income we earn on investments which is heavily influenced by shortterm interest rates 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms as well as with individual brokers agents and direct writers of insurance coverage specifically we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises professional groups insurance companies governments health care providers and nonprofit groups among others provide affinity products for professional liability life disability income and personal lines for individuals associations and businesses provide products and services via grip solutions provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance provide capital management transaction and advisory products and services including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services capital raising contingent capital financing insurancelinked securitizations and derivative applications provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients provide risk consulting actuarial loss prevention and administrative services to businesses and consumers and manage captive insurance companies

hr solutions 

our hr solutions segment generated approximately 34  of our consolidated total revenues in 2013  and provides a broad range of human capital services as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 beginning in late 2008 the disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the financial markets created significant uncertainty in the marketplace weak economic conditions globally continued throughout 2013  the prolonged economic downturn is adversely impacting our clients financial condition and therefore the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate while we believe that the majority of our practices are well positioned to manage through this time these challenges are reducing demand for some of our services and putting continued pressure on the pricing of those services which is having an adverse effect on our new business and results of operations

commissions fees and other revenue were as follows in millions 

commissions fees and other revenue for hr solutions increased   132 million  or 3  in 2013  compared to 2012  due to 3  organic growth in commissions and fees in 2013

unallocated operating expense includes corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments net unallocated expenses remained relatively flat in 2013 compared to 2012  

interest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other incomeproducing investments it does not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients interest income decreased   1 million  or 10  from 2012  due to lower average interest rates globally and lower average cash balances

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with us gaap to prepare these financial statements we made estimates assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 

in accordance with our policies we regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to those concerning revenue recognition restructuring pensions goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies sharebased payments and income taxes and base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

risk solutions segment revenues primarily include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable the company considers revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when all of the following four conditions are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 3 delivery or performance has occurred and 4 collectability is reasonably assured for brokerage commissions revenue is typically recognized at the completion of the placement process assuming all other criteria required to recognize revenue have been met the placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data 

hr solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly project or fixedfee basis revenues from timeandmaterials or costplus arrangements are recognized as services are performed assuming all other criteria to recognize revenue have been met revenues from fixedfee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportionalperformance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement revenues from health care exchange arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants net of a reserve for estimated cancellations assuming all other criteria to recognize revenue have been met reimbursements received for outofpocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues the companys outsourcing contracts typically have threetofive year terms for benefits services and fivetoten year terms for human resources business process outsourcing hr bpo services the company recognizes revenues as services are performed assuming all other criteria to recognize revenue have been met the company may also receive implementation fees from clients either upfront or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant lump sum implementation fees received from a client are typically deferred and recognized ratably over the ongoing contract services period if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract a loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date 

in connection with the companys longterm outsourcing service agreements highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the companys systems and operating processes for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting specific incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue 

restructuring 

workforce reduction costs 

the method used to recognize workforce reduction costs depends on whether the benefits are provided under a onetime benefit arrangement or under an ongoing benefit arrangement we account for relevant expenses as an ongoing benefit arrangement when we have an established termination benefit policy statutory requirements dictate the termination benefit amounts or we have an established pattern of providing similar termination benefits the method to estimate the amount of termination benefits is based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated 

in most cases workforce reductions are made pursuant to an ongoing arrangement we recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from an ongoing benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated and notify the employees 

although it occurs less frequently when a workforce reduction is made pursuant to a onetime benefit arrangement we recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from a onetime benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated notify the employees and expect to terminate the employees within the legally required notification period when employees receive incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period we recognize the cost of their termination benefits over the remaining service period 

lease termination costs 

where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or vacated space and have no intention of reoccupying it we recognize a loss and corresponding liability the liability reflects our best estimate of the fair value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement to determine the loss and corresponding liability we estimate sublease income based on all information that is reasonably available which typically includes current market quotes for similar properties 

useful lives on leasehold improvements or other assets associated with lease abandonments may be revised to reflect a shorter useful life than originally estimated which results in accelerated depreciation 

fair value concepts of severance arrangements and lease losses 

accounting guidance requires that the liabilities recorded related to our restructuring activities be measured at fair value 

where material we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their present value most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time and therefore no discounting is necessary however we may discount the termination benefit arrangement when we terminate employees who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended 

period the discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate which matches the lifetime of the liability significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded 

other associated costs with restructuring activities 

we recognize other costs associated with restructuring activities as they are incurred including moving costs and consulting and legal fees 

pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world our most significant plans are located in the us the uk the netherlands and canada our significant us uk and canadian pension plans are closed to new entrants we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our us uk and canadian plans 

recognition of gains and losses and prior service 

certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions actual demographic experience andor plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost 

unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income as previously described are amortized into compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees for our plans in the netherlands and canada or the average life expectancy of the us and uk plan members after the effective date of the plan amendments to cease crediting future benefits relating to service unrecognized gains and losses are also be based on the average life expectancy of members in the canadian plans we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 

as of december 31 2013  our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor which is defined as 10 of the greater of marketrelated value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation to the extent not offset by future gains incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 

the following table discloses our combined experience loss the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss and the estimated 2014  amortization of loss by country amounts in millions 

the unrecognized prior service cost at december 31 2013  was 27 million  in the uk and other plans 

for the us pension plans we use a marketrelated valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income this approach recognizes 20 of any gains or losses in the current years value of marketrelated assets with the remaining 80 spread over the next four years as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value of assets and therefore our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded as of december 31 2013  the marketrelated value of assets was 18 billion  we do not use the marketrelated valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position instead we record and present the funded status in the consolidated statements of financial position based on the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2013  the fair value of plan assets was 19 billion  

our nonus plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 

rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation 

the following table summarizes the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix as of december 31 2013 

 in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans in particular we surveyed multiple third party financial institutions and consultants to obtain longterm expected returns on each asset class considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 

the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines the actual asset allocation at december 31 2013  was 69 equity and 31 fixed income securities for the qualified plan 

the investment policy for each uk and nonus pension plans is generally determined by the plans trustees because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and nonus category our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan further target allocations are subject to change as of december 31 2013  the uk and nonus plans were invested between 30 and 50 in equity and between 50 and 70 in fixed income securities 

impact of changing economic assumptions 

changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2013  in millions 

 49 

holding all other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our estimated 2014  pension expense in millions 

holding other assumptions constant the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2014  pension expense in millions 

estimated future contributions 

we estimate contributions of approximately 385 million  in 2014  as compared with 523 million  in 2013  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired we classify our intangible assets acquired as either trademarks customer relationships technology noncompete agreements or other purchased intangibles 

goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we also test the acquired tradenames which also are not amortized for impairment we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization a decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate among others no events occurred during 2013  that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames 

we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar if none of its components is a reporting unit or if the segment comprises only a single component 

the goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value including goodwill of the corresponding reporting unit if the more likely than not threshold is not met then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two step analysis step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value we perform step two step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we use a discounted cash flow dcf model based on our most current forecasts we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weightedaverage cost of capital method at the date of evaluation preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments 

and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization commonly referred to as a control premium we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry based on tests performed in both 2013  and 2012  there was no indication of goodwill impairment and no further testing was required 

we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december 31 2013  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future they could materially impact our results of operations 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur under us gaap we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved and amounts due are probable of collection 

sharebased payments 

sharebased compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

share option accounting 

we generally use a latticebinomial optionpricing model to value share options granted latticebased option valuation models use a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options and estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of our share price and the implied volatility of traded options on our shares no share options were granted during 2013 or 2012 

in terms of the assumptions used in the latticebased model we 

 

 

 the expected life of employee share options represents the weightedaverage period share options are expected to remain outstanding which is a derived output of the latticebinomial model 

restricted share units 

restricted share units rsus are servicebased awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant 

performance share awards 

performance share awards psas are performancebased awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives such objectives may be made on a personal group or company level we estimate the fair value of the 

awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 

psas may immediately vest at the end of the performance period or may have an additional service period compensation cost is recognized over the performance or additional service period 

whichever is longer the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates such as longterm plans as a result changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 

the largest performancebased sharebased payment award plan is the lpp which has a threeyear performance period the 2011 to 2013 performance period ended on december 31 2013 the 2010 to 2012 performance period ended on december 31 2012 the 2009 to 2011 performance period ended on december 31 2011 and the 2008 to 2010 performance period ended on december 31 2010 the lpp currently has two open performance periods 2012 to 2014 and 2013 to 2015 a 10 upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both lpp plans would have increased our 2013  expense by approximately 59 million while a 10 downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately 59 million as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases the potential change in expense can go from 0 to 200 of the targeted total expense 

income taxes 

we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries the estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results in the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized or expected to be recognized in our quarterly operating results the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item such as the resolution of prioryear tax matters 

the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on managements assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 

deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if based on the consideration of all available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in this assessment significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a more likely than not determination we have not recognized a us deferred tax liability for permanently reinvested earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries additional us income taxes could be recorded or incurred if we change our investment strategy relating to these subsidiaries which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

we base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on managements interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate managements assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions using different estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes especially those that deploy tax planning strategies may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 

we operate in many jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed in such jurisdictions we typically obtain professional guidance when available and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations in addition several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities including the following

note 2 summary of significant accounting principles and practices of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results if determinable 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates to manage the risk from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks see note 2 summary of significant accounting principles and practices of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 

foreign exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk our primary exposures include exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we use overthecounter otc options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 

additionally some of our nonus brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiary earned approximately 30 of its 2013  revenue in us dollars and 6 of its revenue in euros but most of its expenses are incurred in pounds sterling at december 31 2013  we have hedged 45 and 81 of our uk subsidiaries expected us dollar transaction exposure for the years ending december 31 2014  and 2015  respectively in addition we have hedged 81 of our uk subsidiaries expected euro transaction exposures for the same time periods we generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years 

we also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures such as intercompany notes and shortterm assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency and are subject to remeasurement 

the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in yearend exchange rates would be 40 million and 17 million at december 31 2014  and 2015  respectively 

interest rate risk 

our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the us and on the continent of europe a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 21 million and 32 million to 2014  and 2015  pretax income respectively a corresponding increase in the yearend yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase net of derivative positions of 51 million and 54 million to 2014  and 2015  pretax income respectively 

we have longterm debt outstanding with a fair market value of 39 billion  and 42 billion  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively this fair value was greater than  the carrying value by 208 million  at december 31 2013  and 449 million   greater than  the carrying value at december 31 2012  a hypothetical 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by approximately 6 at both december 31 2013  and 2012  

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events

insurance companies must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are designed to ensure financial solvency of insurance companies and to require fair and adequate service and treatment for policyholders they are enforced by the states in the us by the financial services authority fsa in the united kingdom and by various regulatory agencies in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business licensing of agents monitoring of trade practices policy form approval minimum loss ratio requirements limits on premium and commission rates and minimum reserve and capital requirements compliance is monitored by the state insurance departments through periodic regulatory reporting procedures and periodic examinations the quarterly and annual financial reports to the regulators in the us utilize statutory accounting principles which are different from us generally accepted accounting principles the statutory accounting principles in keeping with the intent to assure the protection of policyholders are based in general on a liquidation concept while us generally accepted accounting principles are based on a goingconcern concept 

the state insurance regulators are members of the national association of insurance commissioners naic the naic seeks to promote uniformity of and to enhance the state regulation of insurance both the naic and the individual states continue to focus on the solvency of insurance companies and their conduct in the marketplace this focus is reflected in additional regulatory oversight by the states and emphasis on the enactment or adoption of a series of naic model laws and regulations designed to promote solvency 

the naic has a formula for analyzing insurers called riskbased capital rbc rbc establishes minimum capital threshold levels that vary with the size and mix of a companys business it is designed to identify companies with capital levels that may require regulatory attention 

the state insurance holding company laws require prior notice to and approval of the domestic state insurance department of intracorporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure including the payment of dividends by insurance company subsidiaries in addition the premium finance loans by cananwill our indirect wholly owned subsidiary are subject to one or more truthinlending and credit regulations insurance premium finance acts retail installment sales acts and other similar consumer protection legislation failure to comply with such laws or regulations can result in the temporary suspension or permanent loss of the right to engage in business in a particular jurisdiction as well as other penalties 

beginning in january 2005 our principal subsidiary in the uk aon limited must be authorized by the fsa previously aon limited was a member of a selfregulatory body regulation by the fsa has been introduced pursuant to the european insurance mediation directive which sets minimum standards for those involved in advising on arranging administering or introducing contracts of insurance the regulation requires significant operational changes for example enhanced disclosures particularly in connection with retail private and noncommercial customers the fsa has also indicated that it will adopt rules regarding use of funds held on behalf of clients that will have significant consequences for all brokers operating in the london market 

clientele 

no significant part of our or our subsidiaries business is dependent upon a single client or on a few clients the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operating segments 

employees 

at december 31 2004 our operating subsidiaries had approximately 48000 employees of whom approximately 44500 are salaried and hourly employees and the remaining 3500 are career agents who are generally compensated wholly or primarily by commission in addition there were approximately 3300 international career agents who are considered independent contractors and are not our employees of the total number of employees approximately 21000 work in the us 

risks related to our business and the insurance industry 

our results may fluctuate due to many factors including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries 

our results historically have been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the insurance industry changes in premium rates affect not only the potential profitability of our underwriting businesses but also generally affect the commissions and fees payable to our brokerage businesses in addition insurance industry developments that can significantly affect our financial performance include factors such as 

• rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products • volatile and unpredictable developments including weatherrelated and other natural and manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism • changes in levels of capacity and demand including reinsurance capacity • changes in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liabilities develop and • changes in business practices and business compensation models our results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully implement a new business model 

in october 2004 we announced that we were terminating contingent commission arrangements with underwriters in connection with the elimination of contingent commissions we are in the process of establishing a new business compensation model there is no assurance that we will be able to develop an effective new business compensation model nor can we assure that any new business compensation model we develop will generate revenues equivalent to those previously received from contingent commissions 

a further decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility 

in 2004 standard  poors sp lowered its ratings on our senior debt to the current rating of bbb from a in addition sp placed all their ratings for aon on credit watch with negative implications also in 2004 moodys investor services moodys and fitch inc placed both our senior debt and commercial paper ratings on negative outlook and credit watch with negative implications respectively 

in march 2005 fitch inc lowered its ratings on our senior debt from a to bbb and affirmed our commercial paper rating of f2 their rating outlook continues to be negative sp affirmed its ratings for aon and removed us from credit watch moodys affirmed its ratings on our senior debt and changed their outlook from negative to stable a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility 

any such further downgrade may trigger obligations of our company to fund certain amounts with respect to our premium finance securitizations including in the event of a downgrade by moodys prior to april 28 2005 up to 61 million with respect to our us facility moreover some of our debt instruments such as our 620 notes due january 2007 250 million of which are outstanding expressly provide for interest rate increases in the case of certain ratings downgrades similarly any such downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether we cannot assume that our financial position would not be adversely affected if we are unable to access the commercial paper market a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt may also adversely affect the claimspaying ability or financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries see a decline in the financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales of insurance products below 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

we believe that competition in our lines of business is based on service product features price commission structure financial strength claimspaying ability ratings and name recognition in particular we compete with a large number of national regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers brokers and with respect to our extended warranty business thirdparty administrators manufacturers and distributors 

some of our underwriting competitors have penetrated more markets and offer a more extensive portfolio of products and services and have more competitive pricing than we do which can adversely affect our ability to compete for business some underwriters also have higher claimspaying ability ratings and greater financial resources with which to compete and are subject to less government regulation than our underwriting operations 

we encounter strong competition for both business and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that provide riskrelated services and products our consulting operations compete with independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world 

in addition the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

• an increase in capitalraising by insurance underwriting companies which could result in new entrants to our markets and an influx of capital into the industry • the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds • changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory investigations • the establishment of programs in which statesponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverage and • additional regulations promulgated by the financial services authority in the uk new competition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of and demand for our products and services to change which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

a decline in the financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales of insurance products 

financial strength and claimspaying ability ratings have become increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies these ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies for the purpose of rendering an opinion as to an insurance companys financial strength operating performance strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders they are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors nor are they recommendations to buy sell or hold specific securities periodically the rating agencies evaluate our insurance underwriting subsidiaries to confirm that they continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to them a downgrade or the potential for a downgrade of these ratings could among other things increase the number of policy cancellations adversely affect relationships with brokers retailers and other distributors of our products and services negatively impact new sales and adversely affect our ability to compete 

virginia surety company inc our principal property and casualty insurance company subsidiary is currently rated a excellent fourth highest of 16 rating levels by am best company combined insurance company of america the principal insurance subsidiary that underwrites our specialty accident and health insurance business is currently rated a excellent third highest of 16 rating levels by am best company bbb good fourth highest of nine rating levels and highest ranking within the level for financial strength by sp and a3 good third highest of nine rating levels for financial strength by moodys investors service we cannot assure that one or more of the rating agencies will not downgrade or withdraw their financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings in the future 

changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

our insurance underwriting subsidiaries own a substantial investment portfolio of fixedmaturity and equity and other longterm investments as of december 31 2004 our fixedmaturity investments approximately 97 was investment grade had a carrying value of 35 billion our equity investments had a carrying value of 40 million and our other longterm investments and limited partnerships had a carrying value of 483 million accordingly changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

for example changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from and the market value of fixedmaturity investments similarly general economic conditions stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our equity investments we monitor our portfolio for otherthantemporary impairments in carrying value for securities judged to have an otherthantemporary impairment we recognize a realized loss through the statement of income to write down the value of those securities 

for 2004 we recognized impairment losses of 3 million we cannot assure that we will not have to recognize additional impairment losses in the future which would negatively affect our financial results 

on december 31 2001 our two major insurance companies sold the vast majority of their limited partnership portfolio valued at 450 million to private equity partnership structures i llc peps i a qualifying special purpose entity qspe the common stock interest in peps i is held by a limited liability company which is owned by one of our subsidiaries 49 and by a charitable trust which is not controlled by us established for victims of the september 11 attacks 51 approximately 171 million of investment grade fixedmaturity securities were sold by peps i to unaffiliated third parties peps i then paid our insurance underwriting companies the 171 million in cash and issued to them an additional 279 million in fixedmaturity and preferred stock securities the fixedmaturity 

securities our insurance underwriting companies received from peps i are rated as investment grade by sp 

as part of this transaction our insurance underwriting companies were required to purchase from peps i additional fixedmaturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments as they are requested beginning in july 2004 aon parent company is funding all future commitments as of december 31 2004 these unfunded commitments amounted to 60 million 

although the peps i transaction has reduced the reported earnings volatility historically associated with directly owning limited partnership investments it will not eliminate our risk of future losses for instance we must analyze our preferred stock and fixedmaturity interests in peps i for otherthantemporary impairment based on the valuation of the limited partnership interests held by peps i and recognize an impairment loss if necessary we cannot assure that we will not have to recognize impairment losses with respect to our peps i interests in the future 

the fasb has a current project on its agenda that is expected to result in a change to us generally accepted accounting principles with respect to financial asset transfers such as the peps i transaction we cannot assure that the current accounting for our peps i investments will be unaffected by these possible changes 

our net pension liabilities may continue to grow which could adversely affect our stockholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity and require us to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans 

to the extent that the present value of the benefits incurred to date for pension obligations in the major countries in which we operate continue to exceed the market value of the assets supporting these obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected primarily as a result of the decline in the equity markets over the past several years some of our defined benefit pension plans particularly in the uk have suffered significant valuation losses in the assets backing the related pension obligation 

current projections indicate that our 2005 defined benefit pension expense for our major pension plans would increase by approximately 18 million compared with 2004 and that cash contributions of approximately 202 million would be required in 2005 total cash contributions to these major defined benefit pension plans in 2004 were 189 million a decrease of 28 million over 2003 future estimates are based on certain assumptions including discount rates interest rates fair value of assets for some of our plans and expected return on plan assets we are currently taking actions to manage our pension liabilities including closing certain plans to new participants however changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees as a result there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been announced 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims lawsuits regulatory matters and tax assessments in connection with our businesses the damages that may be claimed are substantial including in many instances claims for punitive or extraordinary damages the litigation naming us as a defendant ordinarily involves our activities as a broker or provider of insurance products or as an employer it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure 

on april 21 2004 aon received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general of the state of new york calling for the production of documents relating to placement service agreements market service agreements and similar agreements under which insurance carriers pay compensation to aon beyond standard commissions the office subsequently issued several other requests for information to aon as part of its inquiry into alleged practices in the insurance industry including bidrigging fictitious quotes tying and steering of business the departments of insurance or attorneys general of approximately 25 other states have also issued subpoenas or requested information regarding these and other issues aon is fully cooperating with all of these investigations 

purported clients have also filed civil litigation against aon and other companies under a variety of laws and legal theories relating to broker compensation practices and other issues under investigation by new york and other states as previously reported a putative class action styled daniel v aon affinity has been pending in the circuit court of cook county illinois since august 1999 on july 28 2004 the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification on march 9 2005 the court gave preliminary approval to a nationwide class action settlement within the 40 million reserve established in the fourth quarter of 2004 

beginning in june 2004 a number of other putative class actions have been filed against aon and other companies by purported clients under a variety of legal theories including state tort contract fiduciary duty and statutory theories and federal antitrust and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act theories these actions are currently pending at early stages in state court in california and florida and in federal court in illinois south carolina and new jersey aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims the outcomes of these lawsuits and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result cannot be predicted at this time 

beginning in late october and early november 2004 several putative securities class actions have been filed against aon in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois also beginning in late october and early november 2004 several putative erisa class actions were filed against aon in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims the outcomes of these lawsuits and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result cannot be predicted at this time 

in early february 2005 the company received a subpoena from the us department of labor regarding compensation arrangements in connection with clients employee benefit plans the company is cooperating with the investigation 

although the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us on the basis of present information amounts already provided availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of aon however it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel including underwriters brokers and other professional personnel competition for such experienced professional personnel is intense if we cannot hire and retain talented personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in september 2004 we announced that we were implementing a management succession plan and began a search for a new chief executive officer patrick g ryan our current chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors will continue to serve as chief executive officer until a successor is found 

we are actively seeking a new chief executive officer but we can provide no assurances as to when an executive will be hired to fill this management position in addition we cannot give assurance that this search and any related uncertainty regarding the future composition of our management team will not adversely impact our results of operations once we hire a chief executive officer our business may be impacted by our ability to successfully integrate him or her his or her familiarity with our business his or her ability to develop relationships with our employees and his or her implementation of new business strategies 

we are subject to increasing costs arising from errors and omissions claims against us 

we have experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of errors and omissions claims against us which has and may continue to substantially increase our expenses in our insurance brokerage business we often assist our clients with matters which include the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question errors and omissions claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition errors and omissions claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings with respect to our insurance brokerage businesses this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and thirdparty administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and thirdparty administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies for instance if we are providing managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client further regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations 

most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors in the united states this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business affects the way we can conduct our 

insurance underwriting business furthermore state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters 

although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas including employee benefit plan regulation age race disability and sex discrimination investment company regulation financial services regulation securities laws and federal taxation do affect the insurance industry generally and our insurance underwriting subsidiaries in particular with respect to our international operations we are subject to various regulations relating to among other things licensing currency policy language and terms reserves and the amount of local investment these various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses the financial impact of use of capital restrictions and increased training and employee expenses furthermore the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our businesses can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as they have been in the past 

our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including 

• the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries • imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries • imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries • hyperinflation in certain foreign countries • imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments • longer payment cycles • greater difficulties in accounts receivables collection and • the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into united states dollars although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

our financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing our underwriting reserves differ from actual experience 

we maintain reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the reserves that we maintain that could cause variability in our financial results consist of 1 unearned premium reserves 2 policy and contract claim reserves and 

3 future policy benefit reserves unearned premium reserves generally reflect our liability to return premiums we have collected under policies in the event of the lapse or cancellation of those policies under us generally accepted accounting principles premiums we have collected generally become earned over the life of a policy by means of a reduction in the amount of the unearned premium reserve associated with the policy unearned premium reserves are particularly significant with respect to our warranty business given that the premiums we receive for warranty products generally cover an extended period of time if there are significant lapses or cancellations of these types of policies or expected losses for existing policies develop adversely and therefore premiums are not earned as expected it may be necessary to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition expenses associated with the policies because these deferred expenses are amortized over the projected life of the policies or establish additional reserves to cover premium deficiencies 

policy and contract claim reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses including legal and other fees and general expenses for administering the claims adjustment process and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period if the reserves originally established for future claims prove inadequate we would be required to increase our liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the obligation for policy and contract claims does not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost these estimates represent informed judgments based on our assessment of currently available data as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events such as changes in claims handling procedures inflation judicial and legal developments and legislative changes can cause our estimates to vary the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities where the variables affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made reserve estimates are periodically refined as experience develops and further losses are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting the level of reserves for policy and contract claims is inherently uncertain we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

future policy benefit reserves generally reflect our liability to provide future life insurance benefits and future accident and health insurance benefits on guaranteed renewable and noncancelable policies future policy benefit reserves on accident and health and life products have been provided on the net level premium method these reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to investment yield mortality morbidity and withdrawal rates that were determined at the date of issue and provide for possible adverse deviations 

the perceived conflicts associated with our insurance brokerage and underwriting businesses could limit our growth 

historically we have not been able to take advantage of certain business opportunities due to the perceived conflicts associated with owning both our insurance brokerage and underwriting businesses for example we have generally refrained from offering our extended warranty products and services through competing insurance brokers independent brokers have been reluctant to do business with our insurance underwriting business because they believed that any fees or information provided to us would ultimately benefit our competing brokerage business these brokers also have been concerned that any information gleaned by our underwriting business regarding their clients and their clients insurance needs would be shared with our competing brokerage business to solicit new business from these clients similarly competing underwriters have feared that our brokers could share information 

with our underwriting business in an effort to help secure desirable business or alternatively seek price quotes from them only for undesirable business in the future these perceived conflicts could limit our ability to expand our product and service offerings and seek new business through independent brokerage channels 

each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses and the premiums generated by our underwriting businesses in particular a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business moreover the results of our consulting business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve as our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagements with us 

recent and proposed accounting rule changes could negatively affect our financial position and results 

recent accounting changes effected and proposals made could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  statement no 123r is a revision of statement no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 statement no 123r establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 

currently we follows apb no 25 for sharebased payments to employees as such we expense the cost of stock awards over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award we currently do not recognize compensation expense for stock options statement no 123 r will require us to recognize compensation expense beginning in the third quarter 2005 for the unvested portion of compensation expense related to stock options issued before july 1 2005 the expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the options we will continue to recognize compensation expense for stock awards issued before july 1 2005 

all stock awards and options issued after july 1 2005 will be accounted for under the rules of statement no 123r the statement requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions the cost will then be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award no compensation expense is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service the statement allows companies to choose among various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value at the grant date of employee stock options and similar instruments 

we are currently evaluating the statements transition methods and do not expect this statement to have an effect materially different than that of the pro forma statement no 123 disclosures provided in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

we have substantial debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

we have substantial debt outstanding as of december 31 2004 we had total consolidated debt outstanding including our redeemable preferred stock of approximately 22 billion this substantial amount of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries including our insurance underwriting companies we have to rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses payments from our underwriting subsidiaries are limited by governmental regulation and depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries in some circumstances specific payments from our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may require prior regulatory approval and we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in the amounts we anticipate or require 

the volume of premiums we write and our profitability are affected by the availability of reinsurance and the size and adequacy of our insurance company subsidiaries capital base 

the level of business that our insurance underwriting subsidiaries are able to write depends on the size and adequacy of their capital base many state insurance laws to which they are subject impose riskbased capital requirements for purposes of regulating insurer solvency insurers having less statutory surplus than that required by the riskbased capital model formula generally are subject to varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny and intervention depending on the level of capital inadequacy as of december 31 2004 each of our insurance company subsidiaries exceeds naic riskbased statutory surplus requirements 

we purchase reinsurance for certain of the risks underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of business we are able to write and our profitability we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or that we can obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments either of these potential developments could adversely affect our underwriting business 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all 

to better manage our portfolio of underwriting risk we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we assume known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium that we receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders accordingly we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers recently due to industry and general economic conditions there is an increasing risk of insolvency among reinsurance companies resulting in a greater incidence of litigation and affecting the recoverability of claims we cannot assure that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this managements discussion and analysis is organized as follows 



overview 

key drivers of financial performance 

segments 

the key drivers of financial performance vary among our segments 

risk and insurance brokerage services brokerage segment results are affected by a number of key drivers including i conditions in insurance markets generally particularly fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies ii success in attracting new clients and avoiding loss of existing clients iii managing our expenses iv fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and v interest income on our investments in addition in 2004 this segment was substantially affected by the matters discussed under key recent events—investigation by the new york attorney general ag and other regulatory authorities and our related decision to terminate contingent commission arrangements in connection with the elimination of contingent commission arrangements we are in the process of establishing a new business compensation model 

consulting consulting segment results are principally affected by i the employment levels of our clients that are mainly driven by economic conditions ii governmental regulations affecting the health care market employee benefit programs and our clients respective industries iii success in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients iv our success in cross selling services among business units and v managing our overall level of expenses in addition in 2004 this segment was also affected by the matters discussed under key recent events—investigation by the new york attorney general and other regulatory authorities and our related decision to terminate contingent commission arrangements 

insurance underwriting underwriting segment revenues are affected by i consumer buying habits that are influenced by economic conditions ii our assumption of select commercial property and casualty insurance business particularly from our managing underwriting group in our risk and insurance brokerage services segment iii competition with other underwriters including competition based upon claimspaying ratings iv success in selling new policies selling existing policyholders more services and having customers renew their policies v the effectiveness and collectability of our reinsurance contracts particularly in programs where we serve as the fronting company ceding substantially all risk and vi investment results 

corporate and other the key drivers of results in this segment are investment income and debt financing costs 

liquidity 

liquidity is derived from cash flows from our business excluding funds held on behalf of clients and from financing we use liquidity for capital expenditures to repay debt to fund acquisitions and pension obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders because we are a holding company our subsidiaries may not have available cash to pay us dividends which in the case of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries is limited by regulatory and rating agency considerations tax considerations may affect access to cash generated from operations outside the united states as can pension funding requirements in both our domestic and international pension plans 

executive summary of 2004 financial results 

we are proud of the high quality of our products and services the breadth and depth of our intellectual capital and the leading market positions that we have built 

in 2004 consolidated revenues from continuing operations increased 5 to 102 billion mainly due to the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies our organic revenue growth which adjusts revenue growth for the effects of foreign exchange and other factors was flat for the year 

our income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest fell 251 million from 2003 the decrease in income was primarily from our risk and insurance brokerage services segment as well as an increase in interest expense of 58 million due to the adoption at december 31 2003 of fin 46 

several factors that hurt our 2004 results included 

• a 180 million provision for settlements with the new york ag and other regulatory authorities and a 40 million provision for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit • increased net periodic pension expense related to our major defined benefit pension plans of 47 million which primarily affected our risk and insurance brokerage services segment • lost contingent commission revenue of approximately 47 million in 2004 due to the termination of these arrangements as of october 1 2004 and • an 80 million unrealized investment gain recognized in earnings in 2003 relating to our warrants in endurance specialty holdings inc endurance the value of these warrants in 2004 remained consistent with the december 31 2003 value partially offsetting the absence of an unrealized gain on the warrants in 2004 were realized gains of 48 million from the sale of most of our common stock investment in endurance we are working to improve our margins by seeking organic revenue growth and greater financial discipline more specifically we are 

• working to prudently manage employee compensation and benefit expenses • in light of our terminating contingent commission arrangements working with our clients insurance carriers regulators and others to establish a new business model that will ensure that we are properly compensated while maintaining transparency and the trust of our clients • reviewing strategic alternatives for our various businesses during 2004 we sold our us and uk claims businesses as well as other small operations • leveraging our purchasing power with vendors suppliers and landlords • pursuing alternative resourcing strategies such as outsourcing to more efficiently provide nonclientfacing services in third quarter 2004 we began outsourcing most of our us information technology infrastructure to computer sciences corporation over the sevenyear agreement we expect to realize approximately 300 million of aggregate savings beginning in the second half of 2005 from outsourcing and consolidating data centers and other functions and • offering additional services to existing clients who can benefit from our wide range of resources we continue to do a better job of generating and managing our cash more specifically we 

• grew our cash and investment balances our cash balance increased 30 million and our total investment balance increased 13 billion • paid down 46 million of total debt in 2004 we paid down 305 million of domestic longterm debt that was scheduled to be redeemed this year that decrease was mostly offset by an increase in borrowings at our foreign subsidiaries we drew down 334 million on our longterm euro credit facility to ensure adequate liquidity in the fourth quarter of 2004 our debt and preferred stock to total capital percentage declined from 328 at december 31 2003 to 298 at december 31 2004 and • reduced capital expenditure spending by 105 million or 57 from 2003 all of aons financial information reflects the application of critical accounting policies estimates assumptions and judgments as discussed below under critical accounting policies and estimates 

further discussion of these items may be found in the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis 

key recent events 

investigation by the new york attorney general and other regulatory authorities 

the insurance industry has recently come under significant scrutiny by various regulatory authorities 

in april 2004 the new york ag began investigating various insurance industry practices including placement service agreements market service agreements and similar agreements under which insurance carriers pay compensation to insurance brokers including aon beyond standard commissions the new york ag issued subpoenas to various companies in the insurance industry including aon related to these agreements and various other practices including alleged tying of reinsurance bid rigging and soliciting fictitious quotes other state attorneys general and state departments of insurance have also issued subpoenas to aon or begun investigations into contingent commissions and other business practices of brokers agents and insurers and some state regulators have announced that they intend to enact new regulations or policies to govern these practices contingent commissions generally are nonservicespecific volume or profitbased compensation arrangements between insurers and brokers similarly regulatory authorities in other countries are either considering or have already begun similar inquiries aon is fully cooperating with all the investigations and has retained outside counsel to conduct its own internal review of its compensation and other practices 

in october 2004 the new york ag filed a complaint against marsh  mclennan company inc and its subsidiary marsh inc alleging that marsh committed fraud and violated new york state antitrust and securities laws on october 15 2004 marsh announced that it was suspending the use of contingent commission agreements 

on october 22 2004 we announced that we were terminating contingent commission arrangements with underwriters we have nearly completed this process and are working with clients insurance carriers regulators and others to establish a new business model that ensures that we link compensation to specific measurable services in a way that is transparent easy to understand and accepted by clients other insurance brokers and carriers have also announced that they will terminate contingent commission arrangements 

for the year ended december 31 2004 we earned approximately 132 million of contingent commissions versus 169 million in 2003 of the 132 million contingent commissions earned in 2004 

• 111 million was included in our risk and insurance brokerage services segment and • 21 million was included in our consulting segment we earned 15 million of contingent commissions in fourth quarter 2004 versus 52 million in 2003 the amount recorded in this years fourth quarter represents amounts earned on arrangements covering periods prior to october 1 2004 a small number of these arrangements call for the calculations to be performed on an annual basis some of these calculations occurred in the fourth quarter and minimal amounts are likely to be recorded in 2005 

contingent commission revenue was 37 million lower in 2004 compared to 2003 as a direct result of terminating our contingent commission arrangements however we estimated 47 million of lost contingent commission revenue in 2004 that would have been earned had we not terminated these arrangements the loss of revenues from these agreements will likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for 2005 as of december 31 2004 we have approximately 50 million of net receivables recorded related to contingent commissions which we believe we are entitled to and will collect 

during 2004 we also earned approximately 143 million of other compensation for services to underwriters all of which is included in our risk and insurance brokerage services segment this other compensation encompasses activities such as affinity program management managing general 

underwriting and wholesale brokerage where we act as the agent for carriers in addition this includes compensation for specific services as is customary in some markets outside the united states 

on march 4 2005 aon corporation aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively the company entered into an agreement the settlement agreement with the attorney general of the state of new york the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york the attorney general of the state of connecticut the illinois attorney general and the director of the division of insurance illinois department of financial and professional regulation collectively the state agencies to resolve all the issues related to investigations conducted by the state agencies 

the material terms of the settlement agreement are as follows 

the company will pay 190 million into a fund the fund to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients these payments are in full satisfaction of the companys obligations under the settlement agreement and the state agencies have agreed not to impose any other financial obligation or liability on the company related to the lawsuits no portion of the payments by the company is considered a fine or penalty the company will make payments into the fund as follows 

• on or before september 1 2005 the company shall pay 76 million into the fund • on or before september 1 2006 the company shall pay 76 million into the fund • on or before september 1 2007 the company shall pay 38 million into the fund the fund plus interest will be used to compensate the companys eligible policyholder clients according to procedures set out in the settlement agreement no amount paid to the fund will be returned to aon under any circumstances 

on or before june 30 2005 the company will calculate in accordance with a formula approved by the state agencies the amount that each policyholder client is eligible to receive from the fund clients eligible to participate in the fund are those us clients that engaged the company to place renew consult on or service insurance with inception or renewal dates between january 1 2001 through december 31 2004 the relevant period where such placement renewal consultation or servicing resulted in contingent commissions or overrides recorded by aon during the relevant period the eligible policyholders 

on or before june 30 2005 the company must send a notice to each eligible policyholder setting forth among other things the amount it will be paid from the fund if it elects to participate a participating policyholder participating policyholders must tender a release of claims against the company arising from acts omissions transactions or conduct that are the subject of the lawsuits 

on november 30 2005 september 30 2006 and september 30 2007 each participating policyholder shall receive from the fund as much of that participating policyholders aggregate share of the fund as possible with the monies then available in the fund 

in the event that an eligible policyholder elects not to participate or otherwise does not respond by october 30 2005 a nonparticipating policyholder that clients allocated share may be used by the company to satisfy any pending or other claims asserted by clients relating to issues in the settlement agreement in no event shall a distribution be made from the fund to any other client until all participating policyholders have been paid nor shall total payments to any nonparticipating policyholder exceed 80 of that policyholders original allocated share if any funds remain in the fund as of october 1 2007 such funds shall be distributed pro rata to the participating policyholders by november 1 2007 in no event shall any of the amounts paid into the fund be used to pay attorneys fees 

within 60 days of the date of the settlement agreement the company shall commence the implementation of certain business reforms including the following 

• to accept only a specific fee to be paid by the client a specific percentage commission on premium to be paid by an insurer set at the time of purchase renewal placement or servicing of an insurance policy or a combination of both • to fully disclose in plain unambiguous written language commissions in either dollars or percentage amounts • not to accept any other valuable compensation or consideration from an insurer other than as stated above including contingent compensation and any compensation or preference in connection with the selection of insurers from which to solicit bids for clients • not to request or accept from any insurer any false fictitious or inflated quote or quote that does not represent the insurers best evaluation at the time of the minimum premium the insurer would require to bind the insurance coverage sought by the client • not to request or accept from any insurer any promise or commitment for the use of our services including reinsurance brokerage conditioned upon any arrangement to provide preferential treatment for any insurer • not to place renew or service a clients business through a wholesale broker unless agreed to by the client after full disclosure of all the compensation to be received any interest we may have in the wholesale broker and any alternative to using the wholesaler broker • to fully disclose to each client all quotes received in connection with coverage of the clients risk with all terms and all commissions to be received for each quote and to provide disclosure of and obtain clients written consent to all compensation arrangements • to disclose to each client at the end of each year all compensation received during the preceding year from any insurer or third party in connection with the clients policy • to implement companywide written standards of conduct regarding compensation from insurers consistent with the terms of the settlement and institute appropriate training of employees including business ethics professional obligations conflicts of interest antitrust and trade practices compliance and record keeping • to establish a compliance committee of our board of directors that will monitor our compliance with the standards of conduct regarding compensation • to maintain a record of all complaints regarding compensation from any insurer and provide such record to the compliance committee • to file annual reports with new york and illinois for five years the company shall not directly or indirectly seek or accept indemnification pursuant to any insurance policy or other reimbursement with respect to any amounts payable under the settlement agreement 

in accordance with apb opinion no 21 interest on receivables and payables  we have discounted the payment stream associated with the settlement and recorded the present value of the liability and corresponding expense of 180 million in our financial statements as of december 31 2004 the discount was determined using our incremental borrowing rate we have not discounted the payment due on september 1 2005 the settlement was considered fully tax deductible and is not treated as a permanent difference in our tax calculation 

the difference between our agreed settlement amount of 190 million and the amount in our financial statements as of december 31 2004 represents the discount the discount will be amortized over the course of the payment timeframe resulting in an increase in expense 

reconciliation between cash paid and expense incurred 



of the 180 million expensed in 2004 153 million was allocated to the risk and insurance brokerage services segment and the remaining 27 million was allocated to the consulting segment 

in addition to the new york ag and other regulatory investigations we are defending various client class action lawsuits we have provided 40 million for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit of the 40 million recorded 34 million was allocated to our risk and insurance brokerage segment and the remaining 6 million was allocated to our consulting segment 

investment in endurance common stock and warrants 

during 2004 we sold virtually all of our common stock investment in endurance resulting in a 48 million pretax gain for the year ended december 31 2004 we sold 

• 98 million shares at a net realized price of 3270 per share resulting in proceeds of 320 million during fourth quarter 2004 and • 14 million shares at a net realized price of 3320 per share resulting in proceeds of 47 million during first quarter 2004 we invested all the proceeds in shortterm investments that are held by our insurance underwriting subsidiaries 

we retain 41 million stock purchase warrants in endurance these warrants meet the definition of a derivative as described in fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires them to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 

through december 31 2002 these warrants were carried at zero value which approximated their original cost in 2003 endurance completed its initial public offering which provided a market value for the underlying shares and removed much of the uncertainty about the fair value of endurance and the warrants at december 31 2004 we determined that the warrants had a fair value of approximately 80 million consistent with the valuation as of december 31 2003 

we recognized these changes in value in investment income in the corporate and other segment for the year ended december 31 2004 the total change was immaterial the future value of the warrants may vary considerably from the value at december 31 2004 due to the price movement of the underlying shares the passage of time and changes in other factors used in the valuation model see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the valuation of the warrants 

sale of certain businesses 

during 2003 and 2004 we sold certain businesses including our 

• automotive finance servicing business which had been in runoff since first quarter 2001 28 

• uk claims services businesses • a small noncore consulting subsidiary • uk reinsurance brokerage runoff unit and • a small us brokerage unit the operating results of all of these businesses are classified as discontinued operations and prior years operating results have been reclassified to discontinued operations as this table shows 

 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements disposal of operations for further information 

in november 2004 we sold our cambridge integrated services group inc cambridge claims administration business to scandent holdings mauritius limited shm for 90 million in cash plus convertible preferred stock in shm valued at 15 million because of our convertible preferred stock holding and other factors we included cambridges results prior to the sales effective date as well as a pretax gain on the sale of approximately 15 million in income from continuing operations 

from time to time we explore strategic alternatives for our various businesses in february 2005 we announced that we are exploring alternatives relating to our ownership of swett  crawford which is currently the largest usbased wholesale insurance broker with more than 900 employees in 40 offices by exploring alternatives we expect to determine if swett  crawfords potential can be realized more fully under different ownership no decision has been made to sell swett  crawford at this time 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

aons consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to prepare these financial statements we made estimates assumptions and judgments that affect 

• what we report as our assets and liabilities • what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and • the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented in accordance with our policies we 

• regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those concerning revenue recognition investments intangible assets income taxes financing operations policy liabilities including future policy benefit reserves unearned premium reserves and policy and contract claim reserves restructuring costs retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation and • base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances 29 

the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

pensions 

us plans 

effective january 1 2004 the us pension plans were closed to new employees all new employees participate in a defined contribution plan over time this change will reduce the volatility inherent in the accounting for the us pension plans 

aon uses a marketrelated valuation of assets to calculate pension expense this valuation reflects a fiveyear average of the difference between the expected return on plan assets and the actual market value return the prior year marketrelated value is projected to the current date by adjusting for contributions benefit payments and expected returns the asset gain or loss is the difference between the expected return on assets and the actual return on assets twenty percent of the asset gain or loss is recognized in the current years marketrelated value with the remaining eighty percent spread evenly over the next four years 

as of yearend 2004 the marketrelated value of assets does not yet reflect our accumulated asset losses of 142 million these losses will increase pension expense as they are graded into the marketrelated asset value and may be offset by future asset gains as of yearend 2004 we reported a fair value of pension assets of 969 million while the marketrelated value of assets is 1111 million 

under fasb statement no 87 the full gain or loss on assets and obligations is not recorded as expense in the current period statement no 87 allows changes in the projected benefit obligation and market value of assets to be deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense over several years based on the average expected future service of active employees which is currently nine years gains and losses on pension obligations include the net effects of changes in the discount rate as well as demographic changes in the employee data 

for the 2004 valuation year the pension plans have a combined deferred loss of 584 million comprised of unrecognized asset losses of 142 million and other than deferred asset losses of 442 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements we amortize the other than deferred asset losses of 442 million outside of a corridor over about nine years this corridor is defined as 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation for 2005 the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is projected to be 34 million to the extent not offset by future gains the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized 

the pension plan investment policy allows assets to be allocated to various asset classes according to the policy the percentage of total assets invested in each class should fall within a range there is a target allocation for longterm investment decisions however the range provides flexibility to accommodate prevailing market conditions in order to determine the expected longterm rate of return for the pension plan we analyze the historical performance investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the plans asset classes in setting the individual asset assumptions we weight the historical performance data series most heavily toward the geometric average returns we then weight the expected returns for each asset class by the plans target allocation to determine pension expense we currently assume a longterm rate of return of 85 

this table shows the result of the calculation based on the target asset allocation for yearend 2004 the actual return for the 2004 valuation year 105 was in excess of the assumed return 

 there are several assumptions that impact the actuarial calculation of pension obligations and in turn net periodic pension expense in accordance with statement no 87 these assumptions require various degrees of judgment the most significant assumptions are 

• the expected return on plan assets and • the discount rate the same assumptions are used for our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans where applicable changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense for example holding all other assumptions constant a one percentage point 

• decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase our estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 38 million and the estimated 2005 postretirement medical benefit expense by 05 million and • increase in our estimated discount rate would decrease the 2005 estimated pension expense by approximately 31 million and the postretirement medical benefit expense by approximately 05 million similarly holding other assumptions constant a one percentage point 

• decrease in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 11 million and • increase in the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would decrease pension expense by approximately 11 million required cash contributions are also sensitive to assumptions however the assumptions used to determine contributions to the plan are changed infrequently we anticipate cash funding requirements of 47 million in 2005 and 100 million in 2006 

major uk plans 

during 1999 the uk pension plans were closed to new employees and all new employees became participants in a defined contribution plan as with the us plans this change will gradually reduce the volatility of the accounting for uk pension plans as with our other international plans the uk plans are solely obligations of subsidiaries of aon corporation 

for the 2004 valuation year the major uk pension plans have a combined deferred loss from asset and liability experience of 1500 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements we amortize the accumulated loss outside of a corridor over 17 years this corridor is defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation for 2005 the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is 67 million to the extent not offset by future gains the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized 

to determine pension expense we use the fair market value of plan assets generally the trustees of the uk plans determine the investment policy for each plan in total at the end of the 2004 valuation year the plans were invested 66 in equities and 34 in fixed income securities with a fair value of 2355 million in determining the expected rate of return investment community forecasts and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans consideration is given to historic performance data over long periods in order to check the assumption in each class relative to each other the expected returns for each asset class are then weighted by the actual asset allocation of the plans to determine pension expense we currently assume a longterm rate of return of 725 

this table shows the result of the calculation based on the actual asset allocation for yearend 2004 the actual return for the 2004 valuation year 82 was in excess of the assumed return 

 with respect to uk pension liabilities a onepercentage point 

• decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 51 million and • increase in our estimated discount rate would decrease the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 48 million similarly a onepercentage point 

• decrease in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 23 million and • increase in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would decrease estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 23 million cash flow requirements are also sensitive to assumptions however the assumptions used for funding the uk plans are changed infrequently under current rules and assumptions we anticipate uk funding requirements of 152 million in both 2005 and 2006 these contributions reflect minimum funding requirements plus other amounts agreed to with the trustees of the uk plans 

dutch plan 

to determine pension expense we use the fair market value of plan assets that at yearend 2004 amounted to 363 million at the end of 2004 the dutch pension plan has a combined deferred loss of 135 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements we amortize the accumulated loss outside of a corridor over 20 years this corridor is defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation for 2005 the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is 5 million to the extent not offset by future gains the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized 

the target asset allocation is 35 equities and 65 fixed income securities with an allowed deviation of 5 at yearend 2004 the actual asset allocation was consistent with the target allocation the expected longterm rate of return is 6 which results from an expected future return of 8 on equities and a 5 return on fixed income investments 

with respect to dutch pension liabilities a one percentage point 

• decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 6 million and • increase in our estimated discount rate would decrease the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 5 million a one percentage point 

• decrease in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 4 million and • increase in our estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would decrease the estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 4 million at yearend 2004 the dutch pension plan had a prepaid pension asset of 121 million in the future if the funded status of the plan deteriorates this amount could be reflected in a minimum pension liability which would reduce stockholders equity the company accelerated a planned 2005 contribution of approximately 18 million into the pension plan before december 31 2004 

contingencies 

we define a contingency as any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved under gaap we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact 

we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue or changes in approach such as changing our settlement strategy 

we have reflected the impact of the march 2005 new york ag and other regulatory authorities settlement in our december 31 2004 financial statements the settlement amount is fixed and determinable therefore the liability was discounted to the net present value of the payments based on our incremental borrowing rate in accordance with apb 21 the 10 million difference between the settlement amount of 190 million and the 180 million liability recorded in our balance sheet as of december 31 2004 represents the discount this discount will increase our expenses in future years as it is amortized into expense 

in addition to the new york ag and other regulatory authorities settlement accrual we have also accrued 40 million for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit 

policy liabilities 

through our insurance underwriting operations we collect premiums from policyholders and we establish liabilities reserves to pay benefits to policyholders the liabilities for policy benefits claims and unearned premiums are a large portion of the total policy liabilities shown on our balance sheet and are comprised primarily of estimated future payments to policyholders policy and contract claims and unearned and advance premiums and contract fees 

accident health  life 

to establish policy liabilities we develop estimates of reported and anticipated claims based on our historical experience other actuarial data and assumptions on investment yields we base interest rate assumptions on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns although mortality morbidity persistency and interest rate assumptions are set when we issue new insurance policies we may need to provide for additional losses on a product by increasing reserves reducing previously capitalized acquisition costs established for that product or by establishing premium deficiency reserves if there are significant changes in our experience or assumptions the process of estimating and establishing policy and contract liabilities is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved 

liabilities for incurred but unpaid claims include estimated costs relating to incurred and reported claims and incurred but not reported claims the liability for unpaid claims is based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims using best estimates of past experience these estimates reflect known current trends and any other factors that would influence historical data actual experience may vary from anticipated levels due to changes in claim reporting processing patterns and variations from historic averages for the amount paid per claim variations from historic patterns and averages could result in additional changes that increase or decrease unpaid claim liabilities as of december 31 2004 there were no known changes in reporting or processing patterns 

except for products that meet the definition of fasb statement no 97 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain longduration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments  the liability for future policy benefits relating to longduration contracts is accrued when premium revenue is recognized the liability represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders less the present value of future premiums and is estimated using methods that include assumptions such as estimates of expected investment yields mortality morbidity and policy persistency emerging trends in morbidity mortality persistency and asset yields may cause the actual experience to vary from original estimates the financial impacts of changes from original assumptions are taken into account as the actual experience is realized some of these trends can fluctuate significantly over time to the extent that current estimates of the present value of future benefits exceed the present value of future premiums for a product line all excess amounts have been taken into account as a loss there are no current estimates of the overall net gain resulting from improvements from original assumptions 

longduration contracts that meet the definition of statement no 97 such as universal life type products are accounted for in a manner consistent with the accounting for interestbearing or other financial instruments payments received on those contracts are not reported as revenue and a corresponding policy benefit reserve is not established the liability for policy benefits is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders at the date of the financial statements amounts that have been assessed to compensate the insurer for services to be performed over future periods 

and amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract 

claim liability millions reserves for claim liabilities as of the year ended were as follows 

 a 1 increase in the assumed medical cost trends would reduce pretax income by approximately 18 million 

future policy benefits millions reserves for future policy benefits as of the year ended were as follows 

 if a 1 unfavorable change were to occur in the mortality and morbidity assumptions for both the accident  health and life books of business pretax income would be decreased by approximately 7 million 

warranty 

our warranty business is unique in comparison to traditional underwriting businesses in that we are providing warranties for consumer goods and credit these programs are generally reviewed by policy period to determine the necessary reserves for warranty claims for automobile warranty terms may extend as far as seven years with a few warranties lasting longer other warranty lines have terms extending up ten years with a few warranties lasting longer 

in addition to the term of the warranty other characteristics are taken into account when estimating the reserves considerations such as the manufacturer or classes of products are reviewed and embedded in our calculation methodology 

similar to other underwriting activities historic loss development factors are used to project the ultimate loss for recent periods we use the bornhuetterferguson method this method is commonly used in underwriting businesses the bornhuetterferguson method combines loss development methods with an expected loss ratio technique the expected loss ratio is computed using either judgment recent experience or other commonly used statistical methods such as the cape cod method these methods result in a point estimate of our liability which was 822 million as of december 31 2004 we believe that the ultimate development of the recorded liability could be as much as 10 more or 5 less 

sources of uncertainty include technological innovations such as plasma tvs and liquid crystal displays in addition some of our policies include profit sharing where the client participates in underwriting profits but we pay all underwriting losses 

property  casualty 

the loss reserve estimates for all property and casualty lines of business are derived by accident year from a minimum of five standard actuarial techniques including but not limited to incurred and paid loss development factors based on both program history and industry development patterns for similar lines of business a bornhuetterferguson method is also employed incorporating historical loss ratio performance weighted with case emergence to date where such data is available frequency and severity methods are used taking into account claim count emergence and severity trends 

the selected ultimate loss estimates are based on the range of estimates discussed above a typical selection is the average of the estimates but that selection may also be influenced by the consistency of the estimates knowledge of emerging loss trends and rate or benefit changes 

selected ultimate losses are evaluated for business on a direct assumed ceded and net basis from the selected ultimate losses paid losses are deducted to arrive at the total reserve the total reserve includes case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves 

at december 31 2004 our recorded liability was 277 million given the current knowledge of the overall variability of property and casualty exposures loss reserves are expected to fall within 10 loss ratio points or approximately 20 million of our selected estimate 95 of the time 

valuation of investments 

we periodically review securities with material unrealized losses and evaluate them for other than temporary impairment we analyze various risk factors and determine if any specific asset impairment exists if there is a specific asset impairment we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value 

we review invested assets with material unrealized losses each quarter those assets are separated into two categories 

1 assets with unrealized losses due to issuerspecific events which are segmented among four categories fixedmaturity investments publiclytraded preferred stocks publiclytraded common stocks and private common and preferred stocks and other invested assets 2 assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industryrelated events assets with unrealized losses due to issuerspecific events 

fixed maturity investments 

at least quarterly we 

• review the creditworthiness of corporate obligors for changes by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and changes in fundamental financial performance of the underlying entity • monitor cash flow trends and underlying levels of collateral for assetbacked securities and • evaluate all bonds and assetbacked securities whose financial performance has declined for other than temporary impairment publiclytraded preferred stocks we review issuer creditworthiness at least quarterly creditworthiness factors reviewed include nationally recognized credit rating agency rating changes and changes in financial performance of the underlying issuer we monitor all preferred stock investments with declining financial performance for otherthantemporary impairment 

publiclytraded common stocks quarterly we review each common stock investment to determine if its decline in value is deemed otherthantemporary our review includes an analysis of issuer 

financial trends and market expectations based on thirdparty forwardlooking analytical reports when available 

private common and preferred stocks and other invested assets we review quarterly private issue valuations which include recent transaction valuations between the issuer and a third party financial performance reviews and financial trend comparisons with publiclytraded companies in the same or similar industries 

we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment loss when appropriate for these investments with continuous material unrealized losses due to issuerspecific events this decision is based upon the facts and circumstances for each investment 

assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industryrelated events 

invested assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industryrelated events include those negatively impacted by increasing us treasury or local sovereign interest rates corporate and assetbacked credit spread widening common stock price volatility due to conditions in the overall market or a particular industry and illiquid market conditions 

under some conditions it is assumed that a decline in value below cost is temporary this assumption is made for fixedmaturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industryrelated events when the market is expected to recover and we have the intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or the market recovers which is a decisive factor when considering an impairment loss if the decision that holding the investment is no longer appropriate we will reevaluate that investment for otherthantemporary impairment 

an evaluation is made for otherthantemporary impairment for preferred and common stock and other investments with continuous material unrealized losses for two consecutive quarters due to market conditions or industryrelated events an otherthantemporary impairment loss is recognized based upon each investments facts and circumstances we continue to monitor these securities quarterly to ensure that unrealized losses are not the result of issuerspecific events 

intangible assets 

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses 

we 

• classify our intangible assets as either goodwill client lists noncompete agreements future profits of purchased books of business of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries or other purchased intangibles • allocate intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and determine estimated useful lives based on our internal valuations or valuations from qualified independent appraisers we base the calculations of these amounts on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods different estimates or assumptions could produce different results • amortize intangible assets other than goodwill over their estimated useful lives while goodwill is not subject to amortization and • carry intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable impairment reviews are performed at the reporting unit level if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit we would complete further analysis to determine whether there was an impairment loss no further analysis was required in 2004 or 2003 we base our determinations of fair value on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates different estimates or assumptions could produce different results we included the estimated effects of the regulatory investigations and the termination of contingent commission arrangements in our 2004 impairment test 

in march 2005 we reevaluated the results of our annual impairment review due to the subsequent developments on the matters described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and concluded that our initial conclusions remain appropriate and that no impairment loss is required 

review of consolidated results 

general 

in the discussion of operating results we sometimes refer to supplemental information extracted from consolidated financial information which us gaap does not require to be presented in the financial statements 

supplemental information related to organic revenue growth is information that helps aon and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange acquisitions divestitures transfers between business units investment income reimbursable expenses unusual items and for the underwriting segment only an adjustment between written and earned premium 

supplemental organic revenue growth information does not affect net income or any other gaap reported figures it should be viewed in addition to not instead of our consolidated statements of income industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they do not make identical adjustments 

since aon conducts business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties the movements of foreign exchange rates are important to our business in comparison to the us dollar foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore management has isolated the impact of the change in 

currencies between periods by providing percentage changes on a comparable currency basis for revenue and has disclosed the effect on earnings per share this form of reporting is intended to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our operations 

some tables in the segment discussions reconcile organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the segments and subsegments we separately disclose the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact from acquisitions divestitures and transfers of business units which represent the most significant reconciling items in an all other category we total other reconciling items that are not generally significant individually or in the aggregate if there is a significant individual reconciling item within the all other category we provide additional disclosure in a footnote 

summary results for 2002 through 2004 

the consolidated results of continuing operations follow 

 consolidated results for 2004 compared to 2003 

revenue 

in 2004 revenue increased 454 million or 5 over 2003 to 102 billion the movement in foreign exchange rates caused a majority of this increase as revenue increased 67 million excluding foreign exchange effects we do not directly hedge revenues against foreign currency translation because it is not cost effective but we do try to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on pretax income through other hedging strategies 

brokerage commissions and fees increased by 263 million or 4 from the prior year driven almost entirely by favorable foreign exchange rates there was no organic revenue growth in the risk and insurance brokerage services segment in large part due to the termination of contingent commission arrangements as well as a softer insurance market consulting organic revenue grew 1 

premiums and other increased 179 million or 7 from the prior year due to increased retentions a change in an insurance program for a specialty accident and health line and favorable foreign 

exchange rates growth in specialty property and casualty and core accident health and life business was offset by a planned decrease in the runoff businesses 

investment income increased by 4 over 2003 and includes related investment expenses and income or loss on investment disposals and impairments the net increase reflects improved results at the operating segments driven primarily by an increase in shortterm rates partially offset by a decline at corporate 

consolidated revenue by geographic area follows 

 us consolidated revenue which represents 52 of total revenue increased 50 million or 1 in 2004 compared to 2003 the low revenue growth reflects the softer us retail market that began late in 2003 after a twoyear rapid increase in premiums following the september 11 tragedy and lower contingent commission revenue additionally the november 2004 sale of cambridge resulted in a 19 million loss of revenue in 2004 as compared to 2003 

uk revenue decreased 24 million or 1 excluding the positive effects of foreign currency exchange revenue decreased 198 million or 10 the decrease in revenue is attributable to the soft market which resulted in lower premiums and commissions additionally the sale of our uk claims service business resulted in an 82 million loss of revenue in 2004 as compared to 2003 

continent of europe revenue increased 250 million or 17 and rest of world revenue increased 178 million or 14 principally reflecting a weakening of the us dollar 

expenses 

total expenses increased 705 million or 8 over 2003 

general expenses increased 393 million or 6 over 2003 reflecting the impact of 

• foreign exchange rates • increase in our net periodic pension expenses of 47 million for our major plans over 2003 and • a 40 million provision for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit net gains on currency derivative transactions reduced expenses by 45 million in 2004 

the 6 increase in benefits to policyholders was driven by the combination of growth in underwriting revenue the change in an insurance program for a specialty accident and health line and foreign exchange rates in 2003 expenses increased due to higher claims for national program services inc nps of 79 million see the consolidated results for 2003 compared to 2002 section below for more information 

interest expense increased 35 million or 35 primarily due to the adoption of fin 46 on december 31 2003 which required the deconsolidation of our trust preferred capital securities and which was offset by an increase in notes payable interest expense on the notes payable was 58 million for 2004 absent this item interest expense declined 23 million due principally to a reduction in debt 

levels during most of the year see notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

included in our results is a 180 million provision for settlements resulting from investigations by the new york ag and other regulatory authorities 

in 2003 total expenses included a 14 million credit related to the world trade center property insurance settlement the 2003 credit represents a 60 million final settlement of our world trade center property insurance claim net of 46 million paid to a third party relating to temporary office space secured in manhattan after the world trade center was destroyed 

income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest 

because the increase in expenses exceeded the increase in revenues for the reasons described above income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest decreased 251 million in 2004 to 880 million 

approximately 87 of aons 2004 consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest was from international operations the 220 million provisions for settlements resulting from investigations by the new york ag and other regulatory authorities and for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit were considered domestic expenses 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 344 and 37 in 2004 and 2003 respectively differences between the overall effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are typically due to us state income taxes and differentials between us and international tax rates changes in the mix between our us and international pretax income directly impact our effective tax rates in 2004 a onetime tax benefit resulting from the difference between our tax and book basis in cambridge reduced our effective tax rate a summary of these effects is included in the rate reconciliation provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations decreased to 577 million 172 per diluted share from 676 million 204 per diluted share in 2003 basic income per share from continuing operations was 180 and 212 for 2004 and 2003 respectively including the effect of currency hedges the positive impact of foreign currency translation was approximately 018 per share 

to compute income per share we have deducted dividends paid on the redeemable preferred stock from net income in accordance with emerging income task force eitf no 048 the effect of contingently convertible investments on diluted earnings per share  diluted shares outstanding were increased by 14 million to reflect the possible conversion of aons 35 convertible debt securities aftertax interest expense on these debt securities has been added back to income from continuing operations when calculating the diluted income per share 

discontinued operations 

aftertax losses from discontinued operations in 2004 were 31 million 010 and 009 per basic and diluted share respectively in comparison aftertax losses in 2003 from discontinued operations were 48 million 015 and 014 per basic and diluted share respectively 

discontinued operations also include 

• certain insurance underwriting subsidiaries acquired with alexander and alexander services inc aa where we are paying off these subsidiaries liabilities over several years and 41 

• payments related to aas indemnification of liabilities relating to subsidiaries sold by aa before its acquisition by aon there was no material impact on the income statement from the aa discontinued operations in 2004 2003 or 2002 

based on current estimates management believes that these aa discontinued operations are adequately reserved the net liability is included as a component of other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on discontinued operations 

consolidated results for fourth quarter 2004 compared to fourth quarter 2003 

total revenue in the quarter rose 3 to 27 billion excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates revenue was even with last year organic growth declined 1 reflecting 

• a softening insurance market • lower contingent commission revenue of 37 million and • 19 million in lower revenue from the sale of our us claims service business effective november 30 2004 the sale of our us and uk claims services businesses more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions made by our brokerage operations lower claims services revenue in continuing operations is primarily due to the sale of cambridge 

these shortfalls were partially offset by growth in international risk and insurance brokerage operations 

income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest decreased by 248 million or 69 from 2003 the significant decrease was influenced by 

• a provision of 180 million for settlements resulting from the investigation by the new york ag and other regulatory authorities • a 40 million provision for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit and • a credit in 2003 of 60 million representing a final settlement for our overall world trade center property insurance claim these were partially offset by 

• a gain in 2004 of 37 million from the sale of virtually all of our remaining common stock investment in endurance and • a charge in 2003 in the warranty credit and property and casualty subsegment of 45 million for additional losses and reserve strengthening for the nps runoff program see description of nps in the following section under expenses consolidated results for 2003 compared to 2002 

revenue 

total revenues were 97 billion an increase of 11 excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates revenues increased 6 over the comparable period this increase resulted from improvements in brokerage commissions and fees premiums earned and investment income 

brokerage commissions and fees increased 11 to 68 billion as a result of 

• growth in new business • improved client retention rates for most of our businesses • the weakening us dollar and • higher revenue from a large consulting segment outsourcing contract begun in the third quarter 2002 premiums and other primarily related to insurance underwriting operations improved to 26 billion a 10 increase over 2002 the increase reflects growth in some warranty and credit programs along with specialty property and casualty lines and favorable foreign exchange rates 

investment income increased 24 over 2002 and includes related investment expenses and income or loss on investment disposals and impairments the net increase reflects 

• lower impairment writedowns in 2003 of 36 million compared with 130 million in 2002 2002 impairment writedowns included a 51 million cumulative adjustment related to prior reporting periods • a noncash increase in the value of endurance stock warrants of 80 million and equity earnings from our investment in endurance common stock of 25 million equity earnings from our endurance investment in 2003 and 2002 were 46 million and 21 million respectively • interest income in 2002 on a taxrelated settlement of 48 million with no corresponding amount in 2003 and • lower investment income generated by the operating units of 85 million including 27 million on deposittype contracts which reflected lower rates us revenues which represent 54 of total revenue increased 4 in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of growth driven 

• primarily by new business development and improved retention rates in both retail and reinsurance brokerage and • secondarily by growth in the consulting segment resulting from a large outsourcing contract that began in the third quarter 2002 this growth was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our accident  health and life subsegment that was primarily from transferring our us large employer group life and accidental death business to a third party via an indemnity reinsurance arrangement while moderating commercial property and casualty premium rate increases for most lines of coverage continued in 2003 we generally benefit from increased premium rates through increased commissions although higher premiums can cause clients to purchase lower policy limits and retain higher deductibles 

combined uk and continent of europe revenues increased 21 in 2003 to 32 billion and rest of world revenue increased 23 to 13 billion reflecting foreign exchange strong new business and the positive effect of increased premium rates 

expenses 

general expenses increased 10 over 2002 reflecting 

• growth of the businesses • the effect of foreign exchange rates and 43 

• higher overall defined benefit pension plan costs of 131 million for our major plans general expenses in 2002 included 50 million of costs from the planned divestiture of the insurance underwriting segment and a credit of 6 million reflecting the reversal of termination benefits that we incurred as part of our business transformation plan 

benefits to policyholders rose 52 million or 4 primarily as the result of new business volume and losses and reserve strengthening of 65 million relating to nps business a noncore book of runoff business nps was hired to handle quoting binding premium collection claims adjusting and other servicing related to general liability insurance policies issued by one of aons subsidiaries however in mid2002 we obtained a temporary restraining order against nps stopped it from initiating any new business on our behalf and with others sued the company for fraud in 2003 actuaries examined the business that nps had written and reviewed assumptions such as historical loss development patterns and the expected ultimate loss ratio as a result of this review we strengthened our reserves mainly for accident years 2001 and 2002 these reserves should cover future payments we expect to make in the next five to seven years excluding nps benefit payout ratios have declined however due to a shift in product mix 

interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt levels amortization of intangible assets grew 9 million from 2002 due primarily to recent acquisitions as well as foreign exchange rates in the risk and insurance brokerage services segment 

total expenses also included a 14 million credit in 2003 and a 29 million credit in 2002 related to the world trade center the 2003 credit represents a 60 million gain from a final settlement of our world trade center property insurance claim net of 46 million related to the assignment to a third party of temporary office space we needed in manhattan after the world trade center was destroyed the 2002 credit represents a gain resulting from a settlement with our insurance carriers regarding reimbursement for depreciable assets that were destroyed 

income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest 

income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest increased from 840 million in 2002 to 11 billion in 2003 this increase is due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange the improvement in investment income 61 million and 2002 expenses related to the planned spinoff 50 million with no corresponding amount in 2003 approximately 68 of aons 2003 consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest was from international operations 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 37 in both 2003 and 2002 the overall effective tax rates are higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily because of state income tax provisions 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations increased to 676 million 204 per diluted share from 496 million 175 per diluted share in 2002 basic income per share from continuing operations was 212 and 176 for 2003 and 2002 respectively in fourth quarter 2002 we had a common stock offering which increased the number of average common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding including the effect of currency hedges the positive impact of foreign currency translations was approximately 012 per share we have deducted dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stock from net income to compute income per share in accordance with eitf no 048 2003 diluted shares outstanding were increased by 14 million to reflect the possible conversion of aons 35 

convertible debt securities aftertax interest expense on these debt securities has been added back to income from continuing operations when calculating the diluted income per share 

discontinued operations 

aftertax losses from our discontinued businesses in 2003 were 48 million 015 and 014 per basic and diluted share respectively in comparison losses in 2002 from these discontinued operations were 30 million 011 per both basic and diluted share the 2003 results include an aftertax loss on the revaluation of the automotive finance business of 14 million 

review by segment 

general 

aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments risk and insurance brokerage services consulting and insurance underwriting see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information aons operating segments are identified as those that 

• report separate financial information and • are evaluated regularly when we are deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance we attribute revenues to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues 

segment revenue includes investment income generated by invested assets of that segment as well as the impact of related derivatives investment characteristics mirror liability characteristics of the respective segments 

• our risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting businesses invest funds held on behalf of clients and operating funds in shortterm obligations • in insurance underwriting policyholder claims and other types of noninterest sensitive insurance liabilities are primarily supported by intermediate to longterm fixedmaturity instruments investments underlying interestsensitive capital accumulation insurance liabilities are fixed or floatingrate fixedmaturity obligations for this business segment operating invested assets are approximately equal to average net policy liabilities • our insurance subsidiaries also have invested assets that exceed net policy liabilities which allow us to maintain solid claims paying ratings income from these investments are reflected in corporate and other segment revenues 45 

the following tables and commentary provide selected financial information on the operating segments 

 1 intersegment revenues of 72 million and 68 million were included in 2004 and 2003 respectively see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information risk and insurance brokerage services 

aon is a leader in many sectors of the insurance industry globally it is the second largest insurance broker the largest reinsurance broker and the leading manager of captive insurance companies worldwide in the us aon is the largest wholesale broker these rankings are based on the most recent surveys compiled and reports printed by business insurance 

changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds more specifically lower premium rates or a soft market generally result in decreased commission revenues 

after the attacks of september 11 2001 premium rates saw an unprecedented increase since late 2003 however premiums in the property and casualty marketplace have declined the downward rate trend varies by line of business area of the world and when each line of business began its downward trend this trend may inhibit brokers ability to grow revenues 

risk and insurance brokerage services generated approximately 57 of aons total operating segment revenues in 2004 revenues are generated primarily through 

• commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies • fees paid by clients • other carrier compensation and • interest income on funds held on behalf of clients our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of 

• how our clients policy renewals are timed • the net effect of new and lost business • the timing of services provided to our clients and • the income we earn on investments which is heavily influenced by shortterm interest rates 46 

our retail brokerage companies operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms as well as individual brokers and agents and direct writers of insurance coverage specifically this segment 

• addresses the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises professional groups insurance companies governments healthcare providers and nonprofit groups among others • provides affinity products for professional liability life disability income and personal lines for individuals associations and businesses • provides wholesale brokerage managing underwriting and premium finance services to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients • provides actuarial loss prevention and administrative services to businesses and consumers and • offers claims management and loss cost management services to insurance companies and firms with selfinsurance programs during 2004 we exited most of these activities by completing the sale of our uk claims operations in the second quarter of 2004 and our us third party claims administration business in fourth quarter 2004 we review our revenue results using the following subsegments 

• risk management and insurance brokerage — americas brokerage — americas encompasses our retail and wholesale brokerage services affinity products managing general underwriting placement and captive management services and premium finance services in north and south america the caribbean and bermuda • risk management and insurance brokerage — international brokerage — international offers similar products and services to the parts of the world not included in brokerageamericas • reinsurance brokerage and related services reinsurance offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claim recoveries that — enhance the riskreturn characteristics of insurance policy portfolios — improve capital utilization and — evaluate and mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide • claims services claims offered claims administration and loss cost management services we exited most of these activities in 2004 by selling our us and uk claims administration businesses revenue 

continuing the trend from late 2003 the insurance market softened further in 2004 total 2004 risk and insurance brokerage services revenue was 57 billion or 3 over last year excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates revenue declined 1 over last year as a result of 

• soft market conditions reflected in flat organic revenue • a 101 million reduction in revenue from our us and one of our uk claims services businesses which were sold during 2004 and • a 35 million decline from contingent commissions 47 

this table details risk and insurance brokerage services revenue by subsegment 

 this table reconciles organic revenue growth to reported revenue growth in 2004 versus 2003 

 • brokerage—americas revenue was up 1 reflecting the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates organic revenue growth was zero reflecting pricing pressures resulting from an overall soft market and lower contingent commission revenue which was offset by improved retention rates • brokerage—international revenue showed strong improvement as a result of a favorable foreign exchange impact and good organic growth especially in asia france and italy • reinsurance revenue decreased because new business growth was more than offset by lower pricing on retained clients lower renewal business in the americas and higher risk retention by clients • claims revenue was 82 million lower in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the sale of one of our uk claims services businesses in january 2004 in addition revenue declined due to the sale of our us claims services business in november 2004 and lower levels of activity in our us operation during the year this table shows risk and insurance brokerage services revenue by geographic area and total pretax income 

 • us revenue decreased 4 over 2003 due to lower contingent commissions and declines in our wholesale premium financing underwriting management and claims service businesses 48 

• uk revenue declined 3 excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates revenue would have declined 11 both the retail and reinsurance sectors declined primarily as a result of decreased pricing pressures higher retention of risk by clients and lower new business in addition revenue declined 82 million due to the sale in the first quarter 2004 of one of our uk claims services businesses • continent of europe revenue increased 14 driven by a favorable foreign currency impact along with strong organic revenue growth in france and italy • the 13 growth in the rest of world is driven by a favorable foreign currency impact and growth in asia income before income tax 

pretax income decreased 219 million or 26 from 2003 to 629 million despite the increase in revenue in 2004 pretax margins in this segment were 110 down from 152 in 2003 

our income and margins were affected this year by 

• a 153 million provision allocation for regulatory settlements resulting from the investigation by the new york ag and other regulatory authorities • a 35 million reduction in contingent commission revenue • additional net periodic pension expense of 39 million • a 34 million provision for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit • premium declines on brokered coverage and • increase in investment income of 13 million consulting 

aon consulting is one of the worlds largest integrated human capital consulting organizations this segment

in 2004 revenues of 12 billion increased 5 over 2003 revenue on an organic basis grew 1 from last year and resulted from growth in us compensation and international practices especially in europe offset by lower revenue in us employee benefits 

in connection with our termination of contingent fee arrangements contingent commissions decreased 2 million from the fourth quarter 2003 compared to the fourth quarter 2004 

this table details consulting revenue by subsegment 

 this table reconciles organic revenue growth to reported revenue growth in 2004 versus 2003 

 • the increase in consulting services revenue was driven by positive foreign exchange rates and organic revenue growth in us compensation and international operations • outsourcing revenue is down compared to prior year due mainly to slow employment growth in the us economy this table shows consulting revenue by geographic area and pretax income 

 • us revenue decreased in 2004 primarily reflecting lower results in the employee benefits practice 50 

• uk continent of europe and rest of world revenues rose on favorable currency exchange impacts organic revenue growth and the impact of small acquisitions income before income tax 

pretax income was 105 million in 2004 pretax margins in this segment were 84 down from 93 in 2003 the decline was caused by a 27 million provision allocation for settlements resulting from the investigation by the new york ag and other regulatory authorities a 6 million accrual for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit and a 2 million reduction of contingent commission revenue the legal accruals and loss of contingent commission revenue were partially offset by 

• favorable foreign exchange rates • improved profitability of the large human resource outsourcing contract initiated in mid2002 and • effective expense management insurance underwriting 

the insurance underwriting segment

written premiums and fees are the basis for organic revenue growth in this segment however reported revenues reflect earned premiums and fees 

we review our revenue results using the following subsegments 

• accident  health and life  through which we provide an array of accident sickness shortterm disability and other supplemental insurance products most of these products are primarily fixedindemnity obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation • warranty and credit  through which we provide warranties on automobiles and a variety of consumer goods including electronics and appliances in addition we provide nonstructural home warranties and other warranty products such as credit card enhancements and affinity warranty programs and property  casualty through which we provide select commercial property and casualty business on a limited basis the table below reflects written and earned premiums and associated reserves 

 in 2004 revenues of 32 billion increased 9 over 2003 excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates revenues rose 5

this table reconciles organic revenue growth to reported revenue growth in 2004 versus 2003 

 1 the difference between written and earned premiums and fees as a percentage change was 3 for accident  health 0 for warranty and 1 for total revenue in addition a change in accounting for an insurance contract in the us as a percentage change was 6 for accident  health and life and 3 for total revenue • accident  health and life revenue grew 127 million or 8 driven by a change in an insurance program for a specialty accident and health line favorable foreign currency exchange higher investment income and growth in the core business partially offset by planned reductions in runoff businesses of 25 million • warranty credit and property  casualty revenue grew 140 million or 11 due to improvement in our north american warranty as well as european auto and warranty programs growth in the select property and casualty business and favorable foreign currency exchange rates this table details insurance underwriting revenue by geographic area and pretax income 

 • in 2004 us revenue increased as a result of changes in an insurance program for a specialty accident  health line improvements in accident  health and lifes core business along with growth in construction group and warranty programs which more than offset lower results in runoff programs • uk revenue was lower than last year despite favorable exchange rates as a result of lower revenue from a book of uk specialty accident and health business that had been placed in runoff as well as a property  casualty discontinued line of business • continent of europe and rest of world posted significant revenue improvement during the year this increase is primarily the result of a favorable exchange rate impact as well as improvements in our european auto and warranty programs income before income tax 

pretax income of 254 million increased 30 from 2003 pretax margins rose from 68 in 2003 to 81 in 2004 

increased pretax income and margin resulted from 

• 65 million of expense relating to the nps program in 2003 • improved profitability in the traditional lines of accident  health and life • higher investment income of 14 million due to changes in the investment portfolio which increased both duration and returns • positive foreign exchange effects and • profitable growth in north american auto warranty and specialty property  casualty programs these increases were partially offset by 

• lower international auto credit results because auto dealerships continue to deemphasize some credit products and • declines in us electronic warranty results due to discontinued programs as well as losses related to a european electronics warranty program corporate and other 

corporate and other segment revenue consists primarily of investment income including income or loss on investment disposals and otherthantemporary impairment losses which is not otherwise reflected in the operating segments this segment includes 

• invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting businesses and • the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries and related income corporate and other segment revenue includes income from endurance common stock which was accounted for under the equity method before the sale of virtually all of our holdings in december 2004 and changes in the valuation of endurance warrants aon carries its investment in endurance warrants at fair value and records changes in the fair value through corporate and other segment revenue 

private equities are principally carried at cost except where aon has significant influence in which case they are carried under the equity method these investments usually do not pay dividends 

limited partnerships lp are accounted for under the equity method and changes in the value of the underlying lp investments flow through corporate and other segment revenue 

although our portfolios are highly diversified they still remain exposed to market equity and credit risk 

we 

• periodically review securities with material unrealized losses and evaluate them for otherthantemporary impairments • analyze various risk factors and identify any specific asset impairments if we determine there is a specific asset impairment we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value and • review invested assets with material unrealized losses each quarter 54 

this table shows the components of corporate and other revenue and expenses 

 revenue 

corporate and other revenue decreased by 16 million to 109 million in 2004 the revenue decrease was primarily driven by 

• an 80 million noncash increase in the value of the endurance stock warrants recognized in 2003 where previously there had been no value recorded the value of the endurance warrants fluctuated during the year but at yearend 2004 remained approximately 80 million this was mostly offset by • the sale of virtually all of our common stock investment in endurance resulting in a 48 million gain and • lower impairment writedowns of certain fixedmaturity and equity investments of 3 million in 2004 versus 36 million in 2003 loss before income tax 

corporate and other expenses were 69 million or 47 higher than in 2003 as a result of 

• an increase in interest expense of 35 million primarily due to the adoption at december 31 2003 of fin 46 as a result of this adoption we were required to deconsolidate our trust preferred capital securities which were offset by an increase in notes payable interest expense on these notes payable was 58 million for the year absent that item interest expense declined 23 million due principally to a reduction in us debt levels earlier in 2004 • an increase in general expenses of 20 million due in part to increases in compliance costs for the sarbanes oxley act compensation and occupancy expenses and 55 

• a net 14 million credit related to the world trade center in 2003 with no corresponding credit in 2004 these revenue and expense comparisons contributed to the overall corporate and other pretax loss of 108 million in 2004 versus a pretax loss of 23 million in 2003 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity 

our routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock our primary source for meeting these requirements is from dividends and internal financing from our operating subsidiaries additionally we fully drew down our longterm euro credit facility to ensure adequate liquidity in the fourth quarter of 2004 after meeting our routine dividend and debt servicing requirements we used a portion of the remaining funding we received throughout the year for capital expenditures 

our major us insurance subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at yearend 2004 significantly exceeded the riskbased capital target set by the naic 

in the aggregate our operating subsidiaries anticipate there will be adequate liquidity to meet their needs in the foreseeable future and to provide funds to the parent company we have used cash flow primarily for dividend payments business reinvestment debt reduction and acquisition financing 

cash on our statements of financial position includes funds available for general corporate purposes we segregate funds we are holding on behalf of clients and to satisfy policyholder liabilities 

the cash payments for the 190 million settlement with the new york ag and other regulatory authorities will be funded through operating cash flow over the following time frame 



in addition to the new york ag and other regulatory authorities investigations we are defending various client class action lawsuits we accrued 40 million for costs and payments to settle the daniel class action lawsuit 

in 2004 total cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans were 189 million a decrease of 28 million from 2003 in 2003 we made a 100 million early contribution to the us defined benefit pension plan in 2004 we made an early contribution of 18 million for our netherlands defined benefit pension plan under current rules and assumptions we anticipate that 2005 contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans will be approximately 202 million 

in connection with one of our uk pension plans our principal uk subsidiary has agreed with the trustees of the plan to contribute £20 million per year to the plan for six years with the amount payable increasing by 53 on each january 1 beginning in 2005 these contributions are in addition to the normal employer contributions to the plan the trustees of the plan 

• have certain rights to request that our uk subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding up deficit as of december 31 2003 the estimated winding up deficit was £345 million and • have accepted in practice the agreedupon schedule of contributions and have not requested such an advance 56 

at the last valuation date september 30 2004 the estimated deficit between the value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation calculated under us gaap was £108 million of which £92 million was recorded as a minimum pension liability the uk pension plans have been closed to new employees since 1999 

cash flows 

cash flows from operations represent the net income we earned in the reported periods adjusted for noncash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

cash flows provided by operating activities for twelve months 2004 and 2003 are as follows 

 insurance underwriting operating cash flows 

our insurance underwriting operations include accident  health and life warranty credit and property  casualty businesses these insurance products have distinct differences in the timing of premiums earned and payment of future liabilities 

the operating cash flow from our insurance subsidiaries which also includes related corporate items was 541 million for 2004 compared to 360 million for 2003 for 2004 operating cash flows analyzed by major income statement component indicated that premiums and other fees collected net of reinsurance were 3167 million investment income and other miscellaneous income received was 159 million we used these revenues primarily to pay claims and other cash benefits of 1382 million commission and general expenses of 1325 million and taxes of 78 million 

the comparable 2003 premiums and other fees collected net of reinsurance were 2931 million investment income and other miscellaneous income received was 141 million payments included claims and other cash benefits of 1223 million commission and general expenses of 1366 million and taxes of 123 million 

we will invest and use operating cash flows to satisfy future benefits to policyholders and when appropriate make them available to pay dividends to the aon parent company aon parent in second quarter 2004 combined insurance company of america cica one of our major insurance underwriting subsidiaries declared and made a noncash dividend of 71 million to aon parent 

generally we invest assets supporting policyholder liabilities in highly liquid and marketable investment grade securities these invested assets are subject to insurance codes set forth by the various governmental jurisdictions in which we operate both domestically and internationally the insurance codes restrict both the quantity and quality of various types of assets within the portfolios 

our insurance subsidiaries policy liabilities are segmented among multiple accident and health and property casualty portfolios those portfolios have widely varying estimated durations and interest rate characteristics generally policy liabilities are not subject to interest rate volatility disintermediation risk therefore in many of the portfolios asset and policy liability duration are not closely matched interest rate sensitive policy liabilities are generally supported by floating rate assets 

funds held on behalf of clients 

in our risk and insurance brokerage and consulting businesses we typically hold funds on behalf of clients as a result of 

• premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers these premiums held on behalf of or due from clients are reported as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurer • claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers claims held by or due to us and which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities these funds held on behalf of clients can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients and when premiums are remitted to the insurance carriers 

all other operating cash flows 

the operating cash flow from our risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting segments as well as related corporate items was 693 million for 2004 compared to 752 million for the comparable period in 2003 these amounts exclude the change in funds held on behalf of clients from yearend of approximately 50 million in 2004 and 200 million in 2003 as described above the operating cash flows depend on the timing of receipts and payments related to revenues incentive compensation other operating expenses and income taxes in 2004 the net decrease in cash from our risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting segments and related corporate items of 59 million was primarily affected by the timing of income tax payments net of refunds 

aon parent uses the excess cash generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses to meet its liquidity needs which consist primarily of servicing its debt and for paying dividends to its stockholders 

investing and financing activities 

we used the consolidated cash flow from operations net of funds held on behalf of clients of 12 billion for 

• investing activities of 923 million the cash flows used by investing activities included purchases of investments net of sales of 896 million and acquisitions principally made by our international brokerage operations of 80 million additionally our investing activities included capital expenditures net of disposals of 80 million and proceeds from the sale of operations of 133 million • financing needs of 266 million financing uses included cash dividends paid to shareholders of 192 million longterm debt issuance net of payments of 3 million net repayment of shortterm debt of 49 million and cash payments of 51 million for interest sensitive annuity and investmenttype contracts during fourth quarter 2004 we fully drew down our longterm euro facility to ensure adequate liquidity prior to replacing both our longterm euro and us credit facilities which occurred in february 2005 see note 7 debt and lease commitments for further information on our credit facilities financial condition 

since yearend 2003 total assets increased 13 billion to 283 billion at december 31 2004 

in 2004 total investments increased 13 billion to 86 billion from december 31 2003 fixed maturities increased 731 million primarily relating to an asset management program at our insurance underwriting subsidiaries that became effective in 2003 which resulted in a shift from shortterm to longterm investments shortterm investments rose 801 million primarily as a result of an increase in 

funds from the sale of our common stock investment in endurance as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates 

risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting receivables decreased 153 million in 2004 corresponding insurance premiums payable decreased 82 million over the same period the decrease in receivables and payables reflects 

• the timing of receipts and payments and • the decrease in premium rates across most lines of business other assets decreased 223 million from december 31 2003 other assets are comprised principally of prepaid premiums related to reinsurance and prepaid pension assets the decrease from yearend 2003 is due to 

• a reduction of 58 million due to the adoption of sop 031 • the conversion of 55 million of life insurance policies to cash and • a reduction in prepaid premiums policy liabilities in total excluding other policyholder funds increased 501 million but were partially offset by a corresponding increase in reinsurance receivables reflected in other receivables 

other policyholder funds decreased 40 million from 2003 due primarily to interest sensitive and deposittype contracts maturing and our decision to stop offering these programs 

our minimum defined benefit pension liability included in pension post retirement and post employment liabilities increased 157 million since last yearend we are required to maintain at plan level at a minimum a liability equal to the difference between the present value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations 

investments 

we invest in broad asset categories related to our diversified operations in managing our investments our objective is to maximize earnings while monitoring asset and liability durations interest and credit risks and regulatory requirements we maintain wellcapitalized operating companies the financial strength of these companies permits a diversified investment portfolio including invested cash fixedincome obligations public and private equities and limited partnerships 

the corporate and other segment contains invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the insurance brokerage and consulting businesses together with the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the underwriting business and related income these insurance assets which are publicly traded equities as well as less liquid private equities and limited partnerships represent an aggressive investment strategy that gives us an opportunity for greater returns with longerterm investments these assets owned by the insurance underwriting companies 

• are necessary to support strong claims paying ratings by independent rating agencies and • are unavailable for other uses such as debt reduction or share repurchases without considering regulatory requirements see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in december 2001 we securitized 450 million of our lp investments and associated lp commitments which represented most of our limited partnership investments via a sale of peps i the securitization gives our underwriting subsidiaries greater liquidity 

see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments 

borrowings 

total debt at december 31 2004 was 21 billion down 31 million from december 31 2003 specifically 

• notes payable increased by 20 million compared to yearend 2003 this increase is due to an increase in our longterm euro credit facility of 334 million mostly offset by retiring 305 million of outstanding domestic debt securities due in january and july 2004 we fully drew down our euro credit facility to ensure adequate liquidity in the fourth quarter of 2004 and • shortterm debt declined 51 million reflecting a decrease in foreign borrowings we have disclosed future payments of notes payable and operating lease commitments with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2002 we completed an offering of 300 million aggregate principal amount of 35 convertible senior debentures due 2012 the debentures are unsecured obligations and are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately 21475 per common share under certain circumstances including the following 

• if the closing price of our common stock during any fiscal quarter exceeds 120 of the conversion price ie 2577 for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter or 

• subject to certain exceptions during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per 1000 principal amount of the debentures for each day of the ten trading day period was less than 95 of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of 1000 principal amount of the debentures aon has reserved approximately 14 million shares for the potential conversion of these debentures 

at december 31 2004 we had a 775 million unused committed bank credit facility to support commercial paper and other shortterm borrowings the three year portion of the facility was for 4375 million while the 364day portion of the facility was for 3375 million we replaced the facility in february 2005 with a three year 600 million facility this facility allows us to issue up to 150 million in letters of credit 

we also have several foreign credit facilities available at december 31 2004 we had available to us 

• a longterm euro credit facility of €250 million or 334 million which was fully drawn down at yearend this facility was replaced in february 2005 with a new €650 million multicurrency facility which includes a €325 million threeyear and €325 million fiveyear facility see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on both the us and euro facilities • a 364day £45 million facility and a 10 million canadian dollar facility both of which expire in september 2005 and • a €20 million openended facility 60 

the major rating agencies ratings of our debt at march 9 2005 appear in the table below 



in october 2004 

• standard  poors sp lowered its rating on our senior longterm debt from a to bbb and placed all its ratings for aon on credit watch with negative implications and • moodys investor services and fitch inc placed both our senior longterm debt and commercial paper ratings on negative outlook and credit watch with negative implications respectively in march 2005 

• fitch inc lowered its ratings on our senior debt from a to bbb and affirmed our commercial paper rating of f2 their rating outlook continues to be negative • sp affirmed its ratings for aon and removed us from credit watch and • moodys affirmed its ratings for aon and changed their outlook from negative to stable the change in our ratings reflect the rating agencies concern for aons future earnings and cash flow given the announcement eliminating contingent commission arrangements the new york ag and other regulatory authorities investigations and concerns about private litigation 

a further downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper will 

• increase the companys borrowing costs and reduce its financial flexibility the companys 620 notes due 2007 250 million of which are outstanding with a current interest rate of 670 expressly provide for interest rate increases in the case of certain ratings downgrades because of the recent downgrade the interest rate on these notes increased 25 basis points in january 2005 to 695 and • increase aons commercial paper interest rates or may restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether although we have committed backup lines in excess of our current outstanding commercial paper borrowings we cannot assure that the companys financial position will not be hurt if we can no longer access the commercial paper market additional rating changes were as follows 

• in may 2004 am best a major rating agency for our insurance company subsidiaries changed its ratings for our two major insurance subsidiaries as follows cica from a stable outlook to a negative outlook virginia surety company from a stable outlook to a stable outlook • in august 2004 moodys investor services raised its rating for cica from baa1 stable outlook to a3 stable outlook • in october 2004 fitch inc lowered its rating for cica from a stable outlook to a negative outlook 61 

stockholders equity 

stockholders equity increased 605 million during 2004 to 51 billion primarily reflecting 

• 546 million of net income before preferred dividends and • a 146 million after tax foreign exchange benefit these equity increases were partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders of 192 million 

accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased 180 million since december 31 2003 compared to yearend 2003 

• net foreign exchange improved by 146 million because of the weakening us dollar against foreign currencies • net derivative losses increased 10 million and • net unrealized investment gains rose 42 million in past years some of our defined benefit pension plans particularly in the uk incurred losses due to reduced actuarial return assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles require a company to maintain at a minimum a liability on its balance sheet equal to the difference between the present value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations at yearend 2004 the change in pension obligation caused a 2 million aftertax increase to stockholders equity we maintain the related pension plan assets in separate trust accounts they are not part of our consolidated financial statements this noncash adjustment to other comprehensive income did not affect 2004 net income 

for 2005 we project 

• our pension expense for our major defined benefit plans will be 251 million this expense was significantly affected by a lower discount rate and • cash contributions to the major defined benefit pension plans will be 202 million our total debt and preferred securities as a percentage of total capital is 298 at december 31 2004 compared to 328 at yearend 2003 

off balance sheet arrangements 

we record various contractual obligations as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but we are required to disclose them 

aon and its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately 21 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties we accrue amounts in our consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable 

as discussed below we use special purpose entities and qualifying special purpose entities qspes also known as special purpose vehicles in some of our operations following the guidance of fasb statement no 140 and other relevant accounting guidance 

premium financing 

certain of our subsidiaries make shortterm loans generally with terms of 12 months or less to businesses to finance insurance premiums and then sell securitize the finance receivables through securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting in accordance with fasb statement 

no 140 these premiumfinancing securitizations are accomplished by using special purpose entities which are considered qspes pursuant to statement no 140 and fin 46 and commercial paper multiseller nonqualified bank conduit spes statement no 140 provides that a qspe should not be consolidated in the financial statements of a transferor or its affiliates aons subsidiaries 

premium financing securitizations performed by our us uk canadian and australian subsidiaries use multiseller nonqualified spes by analyzing the qualitative and quantitative factors of the spes we have determined that these subsidiaries are not the sponsors of the spes additionally independent third parties 

• have made substantial equity investments in the spes • have voting control of the spes and • generally have the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the spes based on these factors and before the adoption of fin 46 we had determined that nonconsolidation was the appropriate accounting treatment with the adoption of fin 46 as of december 31 2003 we have determined that our subsidiaries do not have a significant variable interest in the spes and therefore we have concluded that nonconsolidation continues to be appropriate 

through the premium financing agreements we or one of our qspes sells undivided interests in specified premium finance receivables to the independent spes under the terms of these agreements new receivables increase the amounts available to securitize as collections administered by aon and reduce previously sold receivables the amount advanced from third parties at any one time under the accounts receivable sales agreement is limited to a maximum of 2 billion 

at both december 31 2004 and 2003 18 billion was advanced under these programs from the spes we record at fair value the retained interest which is included in insurance brokerage and consulting services receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position 

aon recorded gains associated with the sale of receivables when we calculated the gain we included all fees we incurred related to this facility the gains included in revenue in the consolidated statements of income were 81 million 69 million and 70 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

we retain servicing rights for sold receivables and earn a servicing fee as income over the servicing period the servicing fees are included in the gainloss calculation at december 31 2004 and 2003 the fair value of the servicing rights approximates the estimated costs to service the receivables and accordingly aon has not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities related to this servicing activity 

we estimate fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows from the servicing rights and servicing costs using 

• discount rates that approximate current market rates and • expected future prepayment rates the spes bear the credit risks on the receivables subject to limited recourse in the form of credit loss reserves which we guarantee under the guarantee provisions our maximum cash requirement was approximately 73 million at december 31 2004 we renewed the us and european facilities in december 2004 and in january 2005 we eliminated the percentage guarantee for the european facility replacing it with other collateral enhancements in april 2005 we will do the same for the us facility 

both facilities require aon to maintain consolidated net worth as defined of at least 25 billion and 

• consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to consolidated net interest of at least 4 to 1 and • consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of no more than 3 to 1 we intend to renew these conduit facilities when they expire if there were adverse bank regulatory tax or accounting rule changes our access to the conduit facilities and special purpose vehicles would be restricted these special purpose vehicles are not included in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the appropriate accounting standards 

peps i 

on december 31 2001 we sold the vast majority of our lp portfolio valued at 450 million to peps i a qspe the common stock interest in peps i is held by a limited liability company owned by one of our subsidiaries 49 and by a charitable trust which we do not control established for victims of the september 11th attacks 51 

peps i sold approximately 171 million of investment grade fixedmaturity securities to unaffiliated third parties it then paid our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the 171 million in cash and issued them an additional 279 million in fixedmaturity and preferred stock securities 

standard  poors ratings services rated the fixedmaturity securities our subsidiaries received from peps i as investment grade as part of this transaction the insurance companies had been required to purchase from peps i additional fixedmaturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded lp commitments as they are requested in 2004 aons insurance underwriting subsidiaries funded 13 million of commitments beginning in july 2004 aon parent assumed this responsibility aon parent funded 7 million of commitments in 2004 as of december 31 2004 the unfunded commitments amounted to 60 million these commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments 

based on the rating agencies downgrade of aons senior debt credit rating in october 2002 we purchased credit support agreements in january 2003 and as a result 100 million of cicas cash has been pledged as collateral for these commitments during second quarter 2004 the balance of the collateral 59 million was paid as a dividend to aon parent given the current ratings of aon cica and virginia surety corporation the collateral was no longer required as such the collateral account was liquidated in december 2004 and the funds returned to aons operating cash 

subsequent to closing the securitization one of our insurance subsidiaries sold peps i fixedmaturity securities with a value of 20 million to aon in second quarter 2004 cica paid dividends to aon parent of 12 million in fixedmaturities securities we have not included the assets and liabilities and operations of peps i in our consolidated financial statements 

in previous years aon has recognized other than temporary impairment writedowns of 59 million equal to the original cost of one tranche the preferred stock interest represents a beneficial interest in securitized limited partnership investments the fair value of the private preferred stock interests depends on the value of the limited partnership investments held by peps i management assesses otherthantemporary declines in the fair value below cost using a financial model that considers the 

• value of the underlying limited partnership investments of peps i and • nature and timing of the cash flows from the underlying limited partnership investments of peps i 64 

combined global funding 

in 1998 cica an aon subsidiary formed combined global funding llc a cayman islandsbased spe to issue notes to investors under a european mediumterm note program emtn we used the proceeds of the notes to purchase funding agreement policies issued by cica the contract terms of the funding agreement mirror the terms of the trust mediumterm notes historically cica has consolidated the spe based on the guidance in arb 51 and eitf topic d14 more specifically we have 

• classified the emtns as a policyholder liability in our consolidated financial statements rather than as notes payable given that the liquidation preference of the underlying debt more closely resembled the characteristics of a policyholder liability and • included the interest expense on the emtns in benefits to policyholders in the consolidated statements of income the amount of emtns outstanding at december 31 2004 and 2003 were 18 million and 50 million respectively in 2005 the remaining outstanding emtn and the corresponding funding agreement are scheduled to be redeemed after the adoption of fin 46 aon determined that the spe is a variable interest entity and cica is not the primary beneficiary because cica does not have a variable interest in the spe as a result cica was required to deconsolidate the trust on december 31 2003 there was no effect on the consolidated statements of financial position or income statements as a result of this deconsolidation as the funding agreement liability between cica and the spe is now classified as a policyholder liability 

contractual obligations 

the following table 

• summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december 31 2004 and the future periods during which we expect to settle these obligations in cash • reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings 65 

we have provided additional details about these obligations in our footnotes to the financial statements as noted below 

 1 shares are redeemable at the option of aon or the holders beginning one year after the occurrence of a certain future event which occurred in september 2004 2 included in purchase obligations is a 517 million contract for information technology outsourcing with computer sciences corporation we are free to terminate this contract at any time for an amount calculated per the contract however given the nature of the contract we have included it in our contractual obligations table 3 also included in purchase obligations is a 179 million contract for information technology services in the uk as of december 31 2004 we can exit this obligation for approximately 25 million however given the nature of the contract we have included it in our contractual obligations table 4 the 180 million net present value of this liability has been reflected on the december 31 2004 balance sheet in other liabilities we also have obligations with respect to our pension and other benefit plans see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements as well as our discussion on liquidity above 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity prices to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments aon does not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks please see the discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives in notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our primary exposures are to the british pound the euro the canadian dollar and the australian dollar we use overthecounter otc options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations 

additionally some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiary earns approximately 31 of its revenue in us dollars but the majority of its expenses are incurred in pounds sterling our policy is to convert into pounds sterling sufficient us dollar revenue to fund the subsidiarys pound sterling expenses using overthecounter otc options and forward exchange contracts at december 31 2004 we have hedged 89 67 and 52 of our uk subsidiaries expected us dollar transaction exposure for the years ending december 31 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively we do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years 

the impact to 2004 and 2003 pretax income in the event of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the respective quoted yearend exchange rates would not be material given derivative positions 

the nature of the income of our businesses is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments a hypothetical instantaneous parallel decrease in the period end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 10 million and 9 million to 2004 and 2003 pretax income respectively 

the valuation of our fixedmaturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk a hypothetical 1 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of the portfolio at december 31 2004 and 2003 by approximately 119 million and 90 million respectively we have notes payable and preferred securities outstanding with a fair value of 23 billion at both december 31 2004 and 2003 this fair value was greater than the carrying value by 165 million and 234 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively a hypothetical 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value by approximately 5 and 7 at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

the valuation of our marketable equity security portfolio is subject to equity price risk if market prices were to decrease by 10 the fair value of the equity portfolio would have a corresponding decrease of 4 million at both december 31 2004 and 2003 at december 31 2004 and 2003 there were no outstanding derivatives hedging the price risk on the equity portfolio 

  peps i  — in december 2001 aon securitized 450 million of limited partnership investments plus associated limited partnership commitments via a sale to peps i aon received 171 million in cash plus 279 million of newlyissued fixed maturity and preferred stock securities of peps i the underlying equity in the limited partnerships was the basis for determining the fair value of the cash and securities received in the securitization at december 31 2004 a 10 or 20 decrease in the underlying equity of the limited partnerships would have resulted in a decrease in the value of the preferred stock securities owned by 33 million and 67 million respectively 

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events we believe that these changes in rates and prices are reasonably possible within a oneyear period

compensation for services 

accident and health revenues are based on premiums paid by policyholders for insurance coverage and services 

competitive conditions 

the accident and health insurance industry in the united states is highly diverse with more than 1500 accident and health and life insurance companies competing in various segments of the industry we believe that competition in our accident health and life business is based on service product features price commission structure financial strength claimspaying ability ratings name recognition and new legislation or industry developments 

warranty credit and property and casualty

compensation for services 

insurance revenues are based on premiums paid by policyholders certain other revenues are based on fees paid by clients for administrative and other services 

competitive conditions 

we believe that competition in our warranty credit and specialty property and casualty business is based on service product features price commission structure financial strength claimspaying ability ratings and name recognition in our extended warranty business we compete with a large number of insurance companies and other financial services providers in addition to thirdparty administrators manufacturers and distributors 

4 discontinued operations 

the registrant hereby incorporates by reference a portion of note 1 automobile finance servicing business as well as note 6 discontinued operations of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report 

licensing and regulation 

regulatory authorities in the states or countries in which the operating subsidiaries of aon group conduct business may require individual or company licensing to act as brokers agents third party administrators managing general agents reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters under the laws of most states in the us and of most foreign countries regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting renewing and revoking brokers and agents licenses to transact business in the state or country the manner of operating in particular states and countries may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular state or country which may require among other things that a firm operate in the state or country through a local corporation in a few states and countries licenses are issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities in such cases aon group subsidiaries have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the state or country 

insurance companies must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are designed to ensure financial solvency of insurance companies and to require fair and adequate service and treatment for policyholders they are enforced by the states in the us by the financial services authority in the united kingdom and by various regulatory agencies in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business 

licensing of agents monitoring of trade practices policy form approval minimum loss ratio requirements limits on premium and commission rates and minimum reserve and capital requirements compliance is monitored by the state insurance departments through periodic regulatory reporting procedures and periodic examinations the quarterly and annual financial reports to the regulators in the us utilize statutory accounting principles which are different from accounting principles generally accepted in the us the statutory accounting principles in keeping with the intent to assure the protection of policyholders are based in general on a liquidation concept while accounting principles generally accepted in the us are based on a goingconcern concept 

the state insurance regulators are members of the national association of insurance commissioners naic the naic seeks to promote uniformity of and to enhance the state regulation of insurance both the naic and the individual states continue to focus on the solvency of insurance companies and their conduct in the marketplace this focus is reflected in additional regulatory oversight by the states and emphasis on the enactment or adoption of a series of naic model laws and regulations designed to promote solvency effective january 1 2001 the naic revised its accounting practices and procedures manual in a process referred to as codification the domiciliary states of aons major insurance subsidiaries have adopted the provisions of the revised manual the revised manual has changed to some extent prescribed statutory accounting practices and resulted in changes to the accounting practices that aons major insurance subsidiaries use to prepare their statutorybasis financial statements 

several years ago the naic developed a formula for analyzing insurers called riskbased capital rbc rbc is intended to establish minimum capital threshold levels that vary with the size and mix of a companys business it is designed to identify companies with capital levels that may require regulatory attention 

the state insurance holding company laws require prior notice to and approval of the domestic state insurance department of intracorporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure including the payment of dividends by insurance company subsidiaries in addition the premium finance loans by cananwill an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant are subject to one or more truthinlending and credit regulations insurance premium finance acts retail installment sales acts and other similar consumer protection legislation failure to comply with such laws or regulations can result in the temporary suspension or permanent loss of the right to engage in business in a particular jurisdiction as well as other penalties 

recent federal and state laws and proposals mandating specific practices by medical insurers and the health care industry will not because of the nature of the business of the registrants subsidiaries materially affect the registrant numerous states have had legislation introduced to reform the health care system and such legislation has passed in several states while it is impossible to forecast the precise nature of future federal and state health care changes because most of the policies issued by the registrants insurance subsidiaries are supplemental in nature and provide on a fixedindemnity basis protection against lossoftime or disability benefits the registrant does not expect such legislation to have a material impact on its operations congress has passed the financial services modernization act commonly known as s 900 or the grammleachbliley act while s 900 makes substantial changes in allowing financial organizations to diversify the registrant does not believe its enactment will have a material effect on the business of its insurance subsidiaries the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa created a broad series of standards that the health insurance industry as well as health care providers is required to meet collectively these various standards were designed to facilitate and promote the electronic exchange of health information because most of the policies issued by the registrants insurance subsidiaries are supplemental in nature and provide disability and other benefits on a fixedindemnity basis hipaa has not had a material impact on the registrant nor does the registrant expect it to have any significant future impact on these operations 

beginning in january 2005 the registrants principle subsidiary in the uk aon limited must be authorized by the financial services authority fsa currently aon limited is a member of a selfregulatory body regulation by the fsa is being introduced pursuant to the european insurance mediation directive which sets minimum standards for those involved in advising on arranging administering or introducing contracts of insurance the regulation requires significant operational changes for example enhanced disclosures particularly in connection with retail private and noncommercial customers the fsa has also indicated that it will adopt rules regarding use of client funds that will have significant consequences for all brokers operating in the london market 

clientele 

no significant part of the registrants or its subsidiaries business is dependent upon a single client or on a few clients the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the registrant or its operating segments 

employees 

at december 31 2003 the operating subsidiaries of the registrant had approximately 54000 employees of whom approximately 50000 are salaried and hourly employees and the remaining 4000 are career agents who are generally compensated wholly or primarily by commission in addition there were approximately 3600 international career agents who are considered independent contractors and are not employees of the registrant of the total number of employees 25200 work in the us 

risks related to our business and the insurance industry 

our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries 

our results historically have been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties in the insurance industry changes in premium rates affect not only the potential profitability of our underwriting businesses but also generally affect the commissions and fees payable to our brokerage businesses in addition insurance industry developments that can significantly affect our financial performance include factors such as 

• rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products • volatile and unpredictable developments including weatherrelated and other natural and manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism • changes in levels of capacity and demand including reinsurance capacity and • changes in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liabilities develop a decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility 

in fourth quarter 2002 the credit rating agencies lowered the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper on october 31 2002 moodys investors service lowered its rating of our senior debt to the current rating of baa2 from baa1 moodys also placed the rating of our senior debt and the p2 rating of our commercial paper under review for possible future downgrade which it subsequently removed without change also on october 31 2002 standard  poors ratings services placed its a rating of our senior debt on creditwatch with negative implications which it subsequently removed without change on august 13 2003 standard  poors revised its outlook on 

our senior debt from stable to negative a further downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility 

any such further downgrade may trigger a further obligation of our company to fund an aggregate of up to 75 million with respect to our premium finance securitizations moreover some of our debt instruments such as our 620 notes due january 2007 250 million of which are outstanding expressly provide for interest rate increases in the case of certain ratings downgrades similarly any such downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether if we cannot access the commercial paper market although we have committed backup lines in excess of our currently outstanding commercial paper borrowings we cannot assure you that it would not adversely affect our financial position a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt may also adversely affect the claimspaying ability or financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries see a decline in the financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales of insurance products below 

we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses 

we believe that competition in our lines of business is based on service product features price commission structure financial strength claimspaying ability ratings and name recognition in particular we compete with a large number of national regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers brokers and with respect to our extended warranty business thirdparty administrators manufacturers and distributors 

some of our underwriting competitors have penetrated more markets and offer a more extensive portfolio of products and services and have more competitive pricing than we do which can adversely affect our ability to compete for business some underwriters also have higher claimspaying ability ratings and greater financial resources with which to compete and are subject to less government regulation than our underwriting operations 

we encounter strong competition for both business and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis from a large number of regional and local firms in the united states the european union and in other countries and regions from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses including commercial and investment banks accounting firms and consultants that provide riskrelated services and products our consulting operations compete with independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting information systems technology and financial services firms around the world 

in addition the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us these developments include 

• an increase in capitalraising by insurance underwriting companies which could result in new entrants to our markets and an influx of capital into the industry • the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds • the enactment of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 which among other things permits financial institutions such as banks and savings and loans to sell insurance products and also could result in new entrants to our markets • the establishment of programs in which statesponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverage and • changes in consumer buying practices caused by the internet 9 

new competition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of and demand for our products and services to change which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  a decline in the financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales of insurance products 

claimspaying ability ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies these ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies for the purpose of rendering an opinion as to an insurance companys financial strength operating performance strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders they are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors nor are they recommendations to buy sell or hold specific securities periodically the rating agencies evaluate our insurance underwriting subsidiaries to confirm that they continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to them a downgrade or the potential for a downgrade of these ratings could among other things increase the number of policy cancellations adversely affect relationships with brokers retailers and other distributors of our products and services negatively impact new sales and adversely affect our ability to compete 

virginia surety company inc our principal property and casualty insurance company subsidiary is currently rated a excellent third highest of 16 rating levels by am best company combined insurance company of america the principal insurance subsidiary that underwrites our specialty accident and health insurance business is currently rated a excellent third highest of 16 rating levels by am best company bbb good fourth highest of nine rating levels and highest ranking within the level for financial strength by standard and poors ratings services and baa1 adequate fourth highest of nine rating levels and highest ranking within the level for financial strength by moodys investors service we cannot assure you that one or more of the rating agencies will not downgrade or withdraw their financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings in the future 

changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

our insurance underwriting subsidiaries carry a substantial investment portfolio of fixedmaturity and equity and other longterm investments as of december 31 2003 our fixedmaturity investments more than 96 of which were investment grade had a carrying value of 28 billion our equity investments had a carrying value of 42 million and our other longterm investments and limited partnerships had a carrying value of 716 million accordingly changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results 

for example changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from and the market value of fixedmaturity investments similarly general economic conditions stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our equity investments we monitor our portfolio for otherthantemporary impairments in carrying value for securities judged to have an otherthantemporary impairment we recognize a realized loss through the statement of income to write down the value of those securities 

for 2003 we recognized impairment losses of 36 million we cannot assure you that we will not have to recognize additional impairment losses in the future which would negatively affect our financial results 

on december 31 2001 our two major insurance companies sold the vast majority of their limited partnership portfolio valued at 450 million to private equity partnership structures i llc peps i a qualifying special purpose entity qspe we utilized this qspe following the guidance contained in financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 140 statement no 140 and other 

relevant accounting guidance the common stock interest in peps i is held by a limited liability company which is owned by one of our subsidiaries 49 and by a charitable trust which is not controlled by us established for victims of the september 11 attacks 51 approximately 171 million of investment grade fixedmaturity securities were sold by peps i to unaffiliated third parties peps i then paid our insurance underwriting companies the 171 million in cash and issued to them an additional 279 million in fixedmaturity and preferred stock securities the fixedmaturity securities our insurance underwriting companies received from peps i are rated as investment grade by standard  poors ratings services as part of this transaction our insurance underwriting companies are required to purchase from peps i additional fixedmaturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments as they are requested as of december 31 2003 these unfunded commitments amounted to 80 million based on the actions taken by the ratings agencies on october 31 2002 for the parent company credit support arrangements were put into place on january 27 2003 if our insurance underwriting companies fail to purchase additional fixedmaturity securities as commitments are drawn down we have guaranteed their purchase 

although the peps i transaction is expected to reduce the reported earnings volatility historically associated with directly owning limited partnership investments it will not eliminate our risk of future losses for instance we must analyze our preferred stock and fixedmaturity interests in peps i for otherthantemporary impairment based on the valuation of the limited partnership interests held by peps i and recognize an impairment loss if necessary we cannot assure you that we will not have to recognize impairment losses with respect to our peps i interests in the future 

the fasb has a current project on its agenda that is expected to result in a change to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with respect to financial asset transfers such as the peps i transaction we cannot assure you that the current accounting for our peps i investments will be unaffected by these forthcoming changes 

our pension liabilities may continue to grow which could adversely affect our stockholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity and require us to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans 

to the extent that the present value of the benefits incurred to date for pension obligations in the major countries in which we operate continue to exceed the market value of the assets supporting these obligations our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected primarily as a result of the decline in the equity markets over the past several years some of our defined benefit pension plans particularly in the uk have suffered significant valuation losses in the assets backing the related pension obligation 

current projections indicate that our 2004 defined benefit pension expense for our major pension plans would increase by approximately 40 million compared with 2003 and that cash contributions of approximately 195 million would be required in 2004 excluding any legislative relief being considered by the us congress total cash contributions to these major defined benefit pension plans in 2003 were 217 million an increase of 141 million over 2002 and included 40 million originally anticipated and an early contribution of 100 million future estimates are based on certain assumptions including discount rates interest rates fair value of assets for some of our plans and expected return on plan assets changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees as a result there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders equity net income cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been announced 

we are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which if determined unfavorably to us would adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to numerous claims tax assessments and lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business the damages that may be claimed are substantial including in many instances claims for punitive or extraordinary damages the litigation naming us as a defendant ordinarily involves our activities as a broker consultant or provider of insurance products or as an employer it is possible that if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us it could materially adversely affect our future financial results in addition our results of operations financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we selfinsure 

our success depends in part on the efforts of our senior management and our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 

we believe that our continued success depends in part on the efforts of our senior management the loss of the services of any of our executive officers for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriters brokers and other professional personnel competition for such experienced professional personnel is intense if we cannot hire and retain talented personnel our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  we are subject to increasing costs arising from errors and omissions claims against us 

we have experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of errors and omissions claims against us which has and may continue to substantially increase our risk management expenses in our insurance brokerage business we often assist our clients with matters which include the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims errors and omissions claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question errors and omissions claims could include for example the failure of our employees or subagents whether negligently or intentionally to place coverage correctly or notify claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases in addition errors and omissions claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 

our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings with respect to our insurance brokerage businesses this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and thirdparty administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and thirdparty administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions also we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies for instance if we are providing managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client further regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations 

most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors in the united states this system of regulation generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business affects the way we can conduct our 

insurance underwriting business furthermore state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies holding company issues and other matters 

although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas including employee benefit plan regulation age race disability and sex discrimination investment company regulation financial services regulation securities laws and federal taxation do affect the insurance industry generally and our insurance underwriting subsidiaries in particular for example federal financial services modernization legislation and privacy laws such as hipaa and the grammleachbliley act may result in additional regulatory compliance costs limit the ability of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries to market their products or otherwise constrain the nature and scope of our operations with respect to our international operations we are subject to various regulations relating to among other things licensing currency policy language and terms reserves and the amount of local investment these various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses the financial impact of use of capital restrictions and increased training and employee expenses furthermore the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction 

in all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction no assurances can be given that our businesses can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as they have been in the past 

our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business 

a significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the united states accordingly we are subject to legal economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries including 

• the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries • imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries • imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries • hyperinflation in certain foreign countries • imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments • differing business standards • longer payment cycles • greater difficulties in accounts receivables collection and • the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies we must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into united states dollars although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations we cannot eliminate such risks and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

our financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing our underwriting reserves differ from actual experience 

we maintain reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the reserves that we maintain that could cause variability in our financial results consist of 1 unearned premium reserves 2 policy and contract claim reserves and 3 future policy benefit reserves unearned premium reserves generally reflect our liability to return premiums we have collected under policies in the event of the lapse or cancellation of those policies under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states premiums we have collected generally become earned over the life of a policy by means of a reduction in the amount of the unearned premium reserve associated with the policy unearned premium reserves are particularly significant with respect to our warranty business given that the premiums we receive for warranty products generally cover an extended period of time if there are significant lapses or cancellations of these types of policies or expected losses for existing policies develop adversely and therefore premiums are not earned as expected it may be necessary to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition expenses associated with the policies because these deferred expenses are amortized over the projected life of the policies or establish additional reserves to cover premium deficiencies 

policy and contract claim reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses including legal and other fees and general expenses for administering the claims adjustment process and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period if the reserves originally established for future claims prove inadequate we would be required to increase our liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the obligation for policy and contract claims does not represent an exact calculation of liability rather reserves represent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost these estimates represent informed judgments based on our assessment of currently available data as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity frequency judicial theories of liability and other factors many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events such as changes in claims handling procedures inflation judicial and legal developments and legislative changes can cause our estimates to vary the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities where the variables affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made reserve estimates are periodically refined as experience develops and further losses are reported and settled adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed because setting the level of reserves for policy and contract claims is inherently uncertain we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 

future policy benefit reserves generally reflect our liability to provide future life insurance benefits and future accident health insurance benefits on guaranteed renewable and noncancelable policies future policy benefit reserves on accident health and life products have been provided on the net level premium method these reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to investment yield mortality morbidity and withdrawal rates that were determined at the date of issue and provide for possible adverse deviations 

the perceived conflicts associated with our insurance brokerage and underwriting businesses could limit our growth 

historically we have not been able to fully exploit business opportunities due to the perceived conflicts associated with our insurance brokerage and underwriting businesses for example we have generally refrained from offering our extended warranty products and services through competing insurance brokers independent brokers have been reluctant to do business with our insurance 

underwriting business because they believed that any fees or information provided to us would ultimately benefit our competing brokerage business these brokers also have been concerned that any information gleaned by our underwriting business regarding their clients and their clients insurance needs would be shared with our competing brokerage business to solicit new business from these clients similarly competing underwriters have feared that our brokers could share information with our underwriting business in an effort to help secure desirable business or alternatively seek price quotes from them only for undesirable business in the future these perceived conflicts could limit our ability to expand our product and service offerings and seek new business through independent brokerage channels 

each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity 

the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses and the premiums generated by our underwriting businesses in particular a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn especially insolvencies in the insurance industry could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business moreover the results of our consulting business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve as our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagements with us 

recent and proposed accounting rule changes could negatively affect our financial position and results 

recent accounting changes effected and proposals made could negatively affect our financial position or results of operations under fasb statement no 142 which we adopted on january 1 2002 goodwill is no longer being amortized but must instead be tested annually for impairment in its value goodwill is the excess of cost over net assets purchased relating to business acquisitions as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 45 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet if an impairment exists we must recognize a noncash charge equal to the impairment thereby reducing our net worth in 2003 we tested our goodwill and determined that there was no impairment however we cannot assure you that impairment will not exist when we perform testing in future periods and any impairment charge we would be required to take would have a negative effect on our financial position and results under our principal credit facility that supports our commercial paper program we are required to maintain a minimum net worth of 25 billion as of december 31 2003 our net worth calculated for this purpose was 45 billion 

we have substantial debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

we have substantial debt outstanding as of december 31 2003 we had total consolidated debt outstanding including our redeemable preferred stock of approximately 22 billion this substantial amount of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility 

we are a holding company and therefore may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries 

our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries including our insurance underwriting companies we have to rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses payments from our underwriting subsidiaries are limited by governmental regulation and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries in some circumstances specific payments from our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may require prior regulatory approval and we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in the amounts we anticipate or require 

the volume of premiums we write and our profitability are affected by the availability of reinsurance and the size and adequacy of our insurance company subsidiaries capital base 

the level of business that our insurance underwriting subsidiaries are able to write depends on the size and adequacy of their capital base many state insurance laws to which they are subject impose riskbased capital requirements for purposes of regulating insurer solvency insurers having less statutory surplus than that required by the riskbased capital model formula generally are subject to varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny and intervention depending on the level of capital inadequacy as of december 31 2003 each of our insurance company subsidiaries has met the naic riskbased statutory surplus requirements 

we purchase reinsurance for certain of the risks underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase which may affect the level of business we are able to write and our profitability we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or that we can obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities either our net exposures would increase or if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments either of these potential developments could adversely affect our underwriting business 

we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion if at all 

to better manage our portfolio of underwriting risk we may from time to time purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we will assume known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium that we will receive in connection with the risk although reinsurance would make the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk were transferred or ceded to the reinsurer it would not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders accordingly we will bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers if any recently due to industry and general economic conditions there is an increasing risk of insolvency among reinsurance companies resulting in a greater incidence of litigation and affecting the recoverability of claims we cannot assure you that our reinsurers if any will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this managements discussion and analysis is divided into six sections first an overview of the key drivers influencing our financial performance is provided by segment along with an executive summary of 2003 financial results key recent events are then described that affected our financial results in 2003 critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed including certain accounting judgments important to understanding our financial statements we then review our consolidated results and segments with yeartoyear comparisons finally we cover our financial condition and liquidity along with related disclosures as well as information on our off balance sheet arrangements 

the outline for our managements discussion and analysis is as follows 



overview 

key drivers of financial performance 

the key drivers of financial performance vary among our segments 

segments 

risk and insurance brokerage services brokerage segment results are affected by a number of key drivers including i conditions in insurance markets generally particularly fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies ii success in attracting new clients and avoiding loss of existing clients iii managing our expenses iv fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and v interest income on our investments 

when premium rates rise in a hard market commissions generally increase as well however when insurance costs rise insurance buyers resist paying increased premiums that include higher commissions the resistance often results in buyers 

• raising their deductibles • reducing the limits and types of insurance coverage they purchase • switching to negotiated fees or commissions instead of straight commissions • entering the alternative insurance market which can also increase our revenues because we offer these services consulting consulting segment results are principally affected by i the employment levels of our clients that are mainly driven by economic conditions ii governmental regulations affecting the health care market employee benefit programs and our clients respective industries iii success in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients iv our success in cross selling services across business units and v managing our overall level of expenses 

insurance underwriting underwriting segment revenues are affected by i consumer buying habits that are influenced by economic conditions ii our assumption of select commercial property and casualty insurance business particularly from our managing underwriting group in our risk and insurance brokerage services segment iii competition with other underwriters including competition based upon claimspaying ratings iv success in selling new policies upselling existing policyholders and the persistency of these policies and v investment results investment income is derived primarily from our fixed maturity investments and some shortterm investments these investments approximate net policy liabilities segment expenses are mostly benefits to policyholders that include reserve adjustments sales commissions to agents and fees to distributors 

corporate and other the key driver of results in this segment has been investment income for further information see corporate and other in the review by segment section below 

liquidity 

liquidity is derived from cash flows from our business excluding funds held on behalf of clients and from financing and is used for capital expenditures to repay debt to fund acquisitions and pension obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders because we are a holding company the receipt of dividend income from our subsidiaries may be affected by their ability to pay dividends which in the case of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries is limited by regulatory and rating agency considerations tax considerations may affect access to cash generated from operations outside the united states as can pension obligation decisions by trustees of international pension plans 

executive summary 

we are proud of the high quality of our services the breath and depth of our intellectual capital and our product and service offerings and the leading market positions that we have built we believe our bottom line profitability however does not reflect the true potential of our organization we are taking steps designed to improve margins that include 

• reviewing strategic alternatives for our noncore businesses including the possible divestitures of our claims services businesses • modifying our employee benefit programs • leveraging our purchasing power with vendors suppliers and landlords • prudently managing employeerelated compensation and benefit expenses • pursuing alternative resourcing strategies such as outsourcing to more efficiently provide nonclientfacing services • reviewing compensation arrangements with clients to improve the profitability of the valuable services we deliver • offering additional services to existing clients who can benefit from our wide range of resources in 2003 consolidated revenues grew 11 to 98 billion driven by solid demand for our services and products along with the positive influence of foreign exchange rates furthermore 

• risk and insurance brokerage services previously called insurance brokerage and other services our largest segment exhibited good growth in most major business units • consulting revenues rose due to the full year impact of a large outsourcing contract but were restrained by declining employment levels at many of our clients • our insurance underwriting business grew due to higher premiums within the warranty credit and property  casualty lines • our accident health and life lines are a lower growth business and in 2003 revenue growth was constrained by the runoff of certain noncore businesses in latin america a large employer group life book in the us and a specialty book in the uk • our investment in endurance specialty stock and warrants increased our total investment income by 105 million over last year our pretax income from continuing operations and minority interest rose 286 million from 2002 despite our risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting margins declining our overall pretax margin increased 190 basis points due to the increase in investment income from our investment in endurance stock and warrants and the absence of 50 million of expenses in 2002 for the planned divestiture of our underwriting subsidiaries we are however working to further improve our margins through greater financial discipline 

several factors that hurt our margins included 

• increased defined benefit expenses for our major pension plans of 131 million • a significant decline in the pretax income of our claims services business of 48 million • increased adverse loss experience in a previously reported national program services inc nps runoff program of 29 million 23 

we are doing a better job of generating and managing our cash more specifically we 

• paid down more than 300 million of longterm debt in 2003 at yearend our total level of debt and preferred stock outstanding was 33 of our total capitalization which is down from 40 at the beginning of the year • made an early 100 million pension plan contribution in 2003 • reduced capital expenditure spending which was down 33 from 2002 we are targeting even lower capital expenditures in 2004 as our major investments in businesses systems and facilities are now largely complete • reduced the amount we spent on cash acquisitions by 50 compared with 2002 further discussion of these items may be found in the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis 

key recent events 

segment reporting reclassification and cost reallocation 

we classify our businesses into three operating segments risk and insurance brokerage services consulting and insurance underwriting a fourth segment corporate and other when added to the operating segments and after eliminating intersegment revenues totals to the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 

in 2003 certain business units were reclassified among segments certain administrative and marketing services relating to our insurance underwriting operations previously included in the risk and insurance brokerage services segment were reclassified into the insurance underwriting segment our automotive finance servicing business previously included in the risk and insurance brokerage segment was sold in fourth quarter 2003 activity attributable to this business has been reflected in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 

certain amounts in prior years consolidated financial statements relating to segments and discontinued operations have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation 

also beginning in 2003 we refined our methodology for allocating certain costs to the segments for 2003 this revised cost allocation methodology reduced consulting and insurance underwriting segment pretax income by approximately 16 million and 12 million respectively with the 28 million offset reflected in the risk and insurance brokerage services segment the revised methodology improves the assignment of costs which are controlled on a centralized basis to the operating segments 

runoff and discontinuance of certain operations 

we are pursuing a back to basics strategy in the accident and health insurance business and focusing on core products and regions therefore in february 2003 we announced that we would be placing in runoff our accident and health insurance underwriting operations in mexico argentina and brazil in addition we transferred to a third party our us large employer group life and accidental death insurance business via an indemnity reinsurance arrangement these lines of business generated approximately 14 million of revenues and 6 million of pretax losses in 2003 compared to 94 million of revenues and 22 million of pretax losses in 2002 

in the united kingdom in 2003 we decided to runoff certain noncore special risk accident and health business this business generated 36 million of revenue with pretax income of 4 million in 2003 for 2002 we earned revenues of 37 million generating pretax income of approximately 6 million 

in third quarter 2003 we decided to sell our automotive finance servicing business which has been in runoff since first quarter 2001 and completed the sale in fourth quarter 2003 for net proceeds of approximately 18 million operating results from prior periods attributable to this unit have been reclassified as discontinued operations revenues from this business were 13 million in 2003 versus 15 million in 2002 the pretax loss recorded in 2003 of 55 million is comprised of operating losses of 32 million and a loss from the revaluation of the business of 23 million in 2002 our pretax loss was 31 million see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about this discontinued operation 

we are evaluating options within our portfolio of other noncore businesses in 2003 we announced that we were evaluating various strategic options for our claims services group in early 2004 we reached an agreement in principle for the sale of two pieces of our claims services business in the uk and we are examining opportunities for the remaining claims units

to resume business operations and minimize the loss caused by the world trade center disaster we secured temporary office space in manhattan subsequently we leased permanent space and during first quarter 2003 we assigned this temporary space to another company the 2003 costs relating to this assignment were 46 million pretax 

in november 2003 we reached a final settlement of approximately 200 million for our overall world trade center property insurance claim and received a final cash payment of 92 million 108 million received previously this settlement resulted in a pretax gain of 60 million this gain and the 46 million expense discussed above were combined and reported as a 14 million unusual creditworld trade center in the 2003 consolidated statements of income 

endurance warrants and common stock investment 

in december 2001 aon primarily through its underwriting subsidiaries invested 227 million in endurance specialty holdings ltd formerly known as endurance specialty insurance ltd endurance a bermudabased insurance and reinsurance company formed to provide additional underwriting capacity to commercial property and casualty insurance and reinsurance clients as of december 31 2003 the carrying value of our common stock investment in endurance was 298 million representing approximately 113 million shares 

in conjunction with this common stock investment we received approximately 4 million stock warrants which allow us to purchase additional endurance common stock through december 2011 these warrants meet the definition of a derivative as described in fasb statement no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires them to be recorded in the financial statements at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each quarter 

through december 31 2002 these warrants had been carried at zero value which approximated their original cost in first quarter 2003 endurance completed its initial public offering which provided a market value for the underlying shares and removed much of the uncertainty regarding the fair value of endurance and the warrants at december 31 2003 we determined that the warrants had a fair value of approximately 80 million 

this increase in value was recognized in investment income in the corporate and other segment the future value of the warrants may vary considerably from the value at december 31 2003 given the inherent volatility of the underlying shares as well as the passage of time and changes in other factors used in the valuation model see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the valuation of the warrants 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

aons consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap to prepare these financial statements we made estimates assumptions and judgments that affect 

• what we report as our assets and liabilities • what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented in accordance with our policies we 

• regularly evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments including those concerning revenue recognition investments intangible assets income taxes financing operations policy liabilities including future policy benefit reserves unearned premium reserves and policy and contract claim reserves restructuring costs retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation • base our estimates assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances the results allow us to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources if our assumptions or conditions change the actual results we report may differ from these estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies among others affect the more significant estimates assumptions and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements 

pensions 

us plans 

effective january 1 2004 the us pension plans were closed to new entrants all new employees will participate in a defined contribution plan over time this change will reduce the volatility inherent in the accounting for the us pension plans 

aon uses a marketrelated value of assets to calculate pension expense this value reflects a fiveyear average of the difference between the expected return on the marketrelated value of plan assets and the actual market value return the prior year marketrelated value is projected to the current date by adjusting for contributions benefit payments and expected returns the asset gain or loss is the difference between the expected return on assets and the actual return on assets twenty percent of the asset gain or loss is recognized in the current years marketrelated value with the remaining eighty percent spread evenly over the next four years as of yearend 2003 accumulated asset losses of 185 million have not yet been reflected in the marketrelated value of assets these losses will increase pension expense as they are graded into the marketrelated asset value and may be offset by future asset gains as of yearend 2003 we reported a fair value of pension assets of 929 million at the same point in time the marketrelated value of assets is 1114 million 

under fasb statement no 87 accounting the full gain or loss on assets and obligations are not recorded as expense in the current period statement no 87 allows changes in the projected benefit obligation and market value of assets to be deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense over several years based on the average expected future service of active employees which is currently nine years gains and losses on pension obligations include the net effects of changes in the discount rate as well as demographic changes in the employee data for the 2003 valuation year the pension plans have a combined deferred loss of 496 million comprised of unrecognized asset losses of 185 million and other than deferred asset losses of 311 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements only the other than deferred asset losses of 311 million 

outside of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation is subject to amortization over a nine year period for 2004 the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is 23 million to the extent not offset by future gains the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized 

the investment policy for the pension plan provides for an allocation of assets to various asset classes according to the policy the percentage of total assets invested in each class should fall within a range there is a target allocation for longterm investment decisions however the range provides flexibility to accommodate prevailing market conditions in order to determine the expected longterm rate of return for the pension plan the historical performance investment community forecasts and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plan in setting the individual asset assumptions the historical performance data series were weighted most heavily toward the geometric average returns the expected returns for each asset class were then weighted by the target allocation of the plan the expected longterm rate of return assumption used to determine pension expense was 85 

the result of the calculation based on the actual asset allocation for yearend 2003 is shown in the following table the actual return for the 2003 valuation year 12 was well in excess of the assumed return 

 there are several assumptions that impact the actuarial calculation of pension obligations and in turn net periodic pension expense in accordance with statement no 87 these assumptions require various degrees of judgment the most significant assumptions are 1 the expected return on plan assets and 2 the discount rate the same assumptions are used for aons pension plans and postretirement benefit plans changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense for example holding all other assumptions constant a one percentage point decrease in our estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2004 pension expense and the estimated 2004 postretirement medical benefit expense by approximately 32 million and 1 million respectively a one percentage point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the estimated pension expense and the postretirement medical benefit expense for 2004 by approximately 28 million and 1 million respectively 

similarly holding other assumptions constant a one percentage point decrease in aons estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase the pension expense for the year ended december 31 2004 by approximately 11 million a one percentage point increase in the estimated longterm rate of return would decrease pension expense by approximately 11 million for the same period 

required cash contributions are also sensitive to assumptions but assumptions used to determine contributions to the plan are changed infrequently under current rules and assumptions we anticipate cash funding requirements of 28 million in 2004 and 236 million in 2005 legislation being considered in congress will relieve some of these requirements if passed if so contribution requirements are estimated to be 3 million in 2004 and 128 million in 2005 

major uk plans 

for purposes of determining pension expense the fair market value of plan assets is used during 1999 the uk pension plans were closed to new entrants all new employees became participants in a defined contribution plan as with the us plan it is anticipated that this change will over time reduce the volatility of the accounting for uk pension plans as with our other international plans it is also important to note that the uk plans are solely obligations of subsidiaries of aon corporation 

for the 2003 valuation year the major uk pension plans have a combined deferred loss from asset and liability experience of 1404 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements only the accumulated loss outside of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation is subject to amortization over a period of approximately 17 years for 2004 the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is 63 million to the extent not offset by future gains the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized 

generally the trustees of the uk plans determine the investment policy for each plan in the aggregate at the end of 2003 the plans were invested 65 in equities and 35 in fixed income securities in determining the expected rate of return the redemption yields available on the type of fixed income securities corporate and uk government securities used in the pension plans are reviewed for equity returns the expectations of the investment managers for the next 10 to 15 years are considered taking into account projected rates of future inflation and real returns the expected longterm rate of return assumption was 75 

with respect to uk pension liabilities a one percentage point decrease in the companys estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2004 uk pension expense by approximately 56 million a one percentage point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the uk pension expense for 2004 by approximately 49 million 

similarly a one percentage point decrease in the companys estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase the uk pension expense for the year ending december 31 2004 by approximately 20 million a one percentage point increase in the estimated longterm rate of return would decrease pension expense by approximately 20 million for the same period 

cash flow requirements are also sensitive to assumptions but assumptions used for funding the uk plans are changed infrequently under current rules and assumptions we anticipate uk funding requirements of 144 million in 2004 and 185 million in 2005 such contributions reflect minimum funding requirements plus such other amounts agreed to with the trustees of the uk plans 

dutch plan 

for purposes of determining pension expense the fair market value of plan assets is used at the end of 2003 the dutch pension plan has a combined deferred loss of 125 million that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements only the accumulated loss outside of a corridor defined as 10 of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation is subject to amortization over a period of approximately 20 years for 2004 the estimated amortization amount to be recognized in expense is 5 million to the extent not offset by future gains 

the incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense in a similar manner until fully amortized 

the target asset allocation is 35 equities and 65 in fixed income securities with an allowed deviation of 5 at yearend 2003 the actual asset allocation was 38 equities and 62 fixed income the expected longterm rate of return assumption is 6 which results from an expected future return of 8 on equities and a 5 return on fixed income investments 

with respect to dutch pension liabilities a 25 basis point decrease in the companys estimated discount rate would increase the estimated 2004 dutch pension expense by approximately 2 million a 25 basis point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the estimated dutch pension expense for 2004 by approximately 2 million 

a one percentage point decrease in the companys estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets would increase the pension expense for the year ending december 31 2004 by approximately 3 million while a one percentage point increase in the estimated longterm rate of return would decrease pension expense by approximately 3 million for the same period 

at yearend 2003 the dutch pension plan had a prepaid pension asset of 88 million in the future should the funded status of the plan deteriorate such an amount could be reflected in a minimum pension liability thereby reducing stockholders equity 

contingencies 

we define as a contingency any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved under gaap we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact 

we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses we determine the amount of reserves required if any for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual issue the required reserves may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 

policy liabilities 

through our insurance underwriting operations we collect premiums from policyholders and we establish liabilities reserves to pay benefits to policyholders the liability for policy benefits claims and unearned premiums are some of the largest liabilities included in our statements of financial position this liability is comprised primarily of estimated future payments to policyholders policy and contract claims and unearned and advance premiums and contract fees 

to establish policy liabilities we rely upon estimates for reported and anticipated claims our historical experience other actuarial data and with respect to accident health and life liabilities assumptions on investment yields we base interest rate assumptions on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns although mortality and interest rate assumptions are lockedin when we issue new insurance policies we may need to provide for expected losses on a product by reducing previously capitalized acquisition costs established for that product or by establishing premium deficiency reserves if there are significant changes in our experience or assumptions the process of estimating and establishing policy and contract liabilities is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved 

while we made every effort to estimate these liabilities effectively the results we report in our consolidated financial statements could be affected by trends which do not match historical experience 

or which differ from our underlying assumptions furthermore when our actual experience differs from our previous estimate the difference will be reflected in the results we report for the period when we changed our estimate we always consider trends in actual experience as a significant factor in helping us determine claim reserve levels 

intangible assets 

intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses we classify our intangible assets as either goodwill client lists noncompete agreements future profits of purchased books of business of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries or other purchased intangibles intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives while goodwill is not subject to amortization allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the determination of estimated useful lives are based on valuations we perform internally or that we receive from qualified independent appraisers the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position 

while goodwill is not amortized it is subject to periodic reviews for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we review goodwill for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such impairment reviews are performed at the reporting unit level with respect to goodwill under those circumstances if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings no such indicators were noted in 2003 and 2002 the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

review of consolidated results 

general 

in the discussion of operating results we sometimes refer to supplemental information extracted from consolidated financial information which is not required to be presented in the financial statements by us gaap 

supplemental information related to organic revenue growth is information that management believes is an important measure to evaluate business production from existing operations we also believe that this supplemental information is helpful to investors organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange acquisitions divestitures transfers between business units investment income reimbursable expenses unusual items and for the underwriting segment only an adjustment between written and earned premium 

the supplemental organic revenue growth information does not affect net income or any other gaap reported figures it should be viewed in addition to not in lieu of our consolidated statements of income industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance although they do not make identical adjustments 

aon has offices in more than 125 countries and sovereignties movement of foreign exchange rates in comparison to the us dollar may be significant and may distort true periodtoperiod comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income therefore management has isolated the impact of the change in currencies between periods by providing percentage changes on a comparable currency basis for revenue and has disclosed the effect on earnings per share reporting on this basis gives financial statement users more meaningful information about our operations 

certain tables in the segment discussions show a reconciliation of organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the segments and subsegments we separately disclose the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact from acquisitions divestitures and transfers of business units which represent the most significant reconciling items other reconciling items are generally not significant individually or in the aggregate and are therefore totaled in an all other category if there is a significant individual reconciling item within the all other category we provide additional disclosure in a footnote 

summary results for 2001 through 2003 

the consolidated results of continuing operations follow 

 consolidated results for 2003 compared to 2002 

revenue 

in 2003 revenue increased 11 over 2002 to 98 billion we saw improvements in brokerage commissions and fees premiums earned and investment income excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates revenue increased 6 we do not directly hedge revenues against foreign currency translation because it is not cost effective but we do attempt to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on pretax income through hedging strategies 

consolidated revenue by geographic area follows 

 us consolidated revenue which represents 53 of total revenue increased 4 in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of growth driven 

• primarily by new business development and improved retention rates in both retail and reinsurance brokerage • secondarily by revenue gains in the consulting segment as the result of a large outsourcing contract that began in third quarter 2002 these gains were partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our accident  health and life subsegment that was primarily from transferring our 32 

us large employer group life and accidental death business to a third party via an indemnity reinsurance arrangement 

while moderating commercial property and casualty premium rate increases for most lines of coverage continued in 2003 as a broker we benefit from this through increased commissions in addition client demand for risk retention programs and services contributed to this increase especially reinsurance and wholesale brokerage 

uk and continent of europe revenue combined increased 21 to 33 billion and rest of world revenue increased 23 reflecting a positive impact from foreign exchange strong new business and increasing premium and retention rates 

brokerage commissions and fees increased 11 to 69 billion as a result of 

• the growth in new business • improved renewal rates for most of our businesses • the weakening us dollar • higher revenue from a large consulting segment outsourcing contract begun in third quarter 2002 premiums and other primarily related to insurance underwriting operations improved to 26 billion a 10 increase over 2002 the increase reflects growth in some warranty and credit programs along with specialty property and casualty lines and favorable foreign exchange rates 

investment income increased by 26 over 2002 and includes related expenses and income or loss on disposals and impairments the net increase reflects 

• lower impairment writedowns in 2003 of 36 million compared with 130 million last year 2002 impairment writedowns included a 51 million cumulative adjustment related to prior reporting periods • a noncash increase in the value of endurance stock warrants of 80 million and equity earnings from our investment in endurance common stock of 46 million equity earnings from our endurance investment in 2002 were 21 million • investment income in 2002 included interest on a taxrelated settlement of 48 million with no corresponding amount in 2003 • lower investment income generated by the operating units of 81 million including 27 million on deposittype contracts reflecting lower rates expenses 

total expenses increased 717 million or 9 over 2002 

general expenses increased 10 over 2002 reflecting 

• growth of the businesses • the effect of foreign exchange rates • higher overall defined benefit pension plan costs of 131 million for our major plans general expenses in 2002 included 50 million of costs from the planned divestiture of the insurance underwriting segment and a credit of 6 million reflecting the reversal of termination benefits previously incurred as part of the business transformation plan 

benefits to policyholders rose 52 million or 4 primarily as the result of new business volume and losses and reserve strengthening of 65 million related to nps a noncore book of runoff business nps was hired to handle quoting binding premium collection claims adjusting and other servicing related to general liability insurance policies issued by one of aons subsidiaries we stopped nps from initiating any new business on our behalf in mid2002 after we obtained a temporary restraining order we and others sued nps for fraud among other things 

benefit payout ratios have declined however due to a shift in product mix 

interest expense was down primarily due to lower debt levels amortization of intangible assets grew 9 million from 2002 due primarily to the impact of recent acquisitions as well as foreign exchange rates in the risk and insurance brokerage services segment 

total expenses also included a 14 million credit in 2003 and a 29 million credit in 2002 related to the world trade center the 2003 credit represents a 60 million gain from a final settlement of our world trade center property insurance claim net of 46 million related to the assignment to a third party of temporary office space secured in manhattan after the world trade center was destroyed the 2002 credit represents a gain resulting from a settlement with our insurance carriers regarding reimbursement for depreciable assets destroyed 

income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest 

income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest increased 286 million in 2003 to 11 billion contributing to this increase were the impact of foreign exchange the improvement in investment income 65 million and 2002 expenses related to the planned spinoff 50 million with no corresponding amount in 2003 approximately 67 of aons 2003 consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest was from international operations 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 37 in both 2003 and 2002 the overall effective tax rate is higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations increased to 663 million 208 per dilutive share from 486 million 171 per dilutive share in 2002 basic income from continuing operations per share was 208 and 172 for 2003 and 2002 respectively in the fourth quarter 2002 we had a common stock offering which increased the number of average common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding after netting the effect of currency hedges the positive impact of foreign currency translations was approximately 013 per share we have deducted dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stock from net income to compute income per share 

discontinued operations 

aftertax losses from our discontinued automotive finance servicing business in 2003 were 35 million 011 per both basic and dilutive share in comparison losses in 2002 from this discontinued operation were 20 million 007 per both basic and dilutive share the 2003 results include an aftertax loss on the revaluation of the automotive finance servicing business of 14 million 

discontinued operations also include certain insurance underwriting subsidiaries acquired with alexander and alexander services inc aa that are in runoff and the indemnification by aa of certain liabilities relating to subsidiaries sold by aa before its acquisition by aon there was no income statement impact from these discontinued operations in 2003 2002 or 2001 

based on current estimates management believes that these discontinued operations are adequately reserved the net liability is included as a component of other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position in 2003 and 2002 aon settled some of these liabilities the settlements had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements see notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on discontinued operations 

consolidated results for fourth quarter 2003 compared to fourth quarter 2002 

total revenues in the quarter rose 10 to 26 billion excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates revenue climbed 4 the higher revenue is primarily due to 

• very good results from the international risk and insurance brokerage area combined with improvement in us brokerage and reinsurance • growth in new business and improved renewal rates • growth in some warranty and credit programs along with specialty property and casualty lines • increased investment income in the corporate and other segment reflecting the change in value of warrants we held in endurance of 16 million income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest increased by 56 million or 19 over 2002 both this and last years results include settlements for various world trade center claims the net change yearoveryear for these settlements increased pretax income in 2003 by 49 million 

this income growth was partially offset by 

• an increase in costs for our major defined benefit pension plans which increased the expense for the quarter by 34 million • a net charge in the warranty credit and property and casualty subsegment of 44 million for additional losses and reserve strengthening for the nps runoff program consolidated results for 2002 compared to 2001 

revenue 

total revenues were 88 billion an increase of 15 excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates revenues increased 14 over the comparable period this increase results from improvements in brokerage commissions and fees premiums earned and investment income 

us revenues which represent 57 of total revenue increased 13 in 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of strong organic growth resulting from 

• commercial property and casualty premium rate increases • client demand for risk retention programs and services uk and continent of europe revenues combined increased 18 to 27 billion and rest of world revenue increased 19 reflecting strong new business and increasing premium rates which increase commissions and foreign exchange 

brokerage commissions and fees increased 14 to 62 billion primarily from organic growth including increased premium rates increased new business and outsourcing contracts this growth was offset somewhat by revenue disruptions in the early part of the year with our managing general underwriter unit acquisitions contributed 90 million of incremental revenue in 2002 

premiums and other increased 17 in 2002 to 24 billion this increase primarily reflects growth in new business initiatives traditional accident and health lines and new specialty property and casualty lines this increase was somewhat offset by the prior loss of some accounts in the warranty business 

investment income increased by 18 over 2001 despite a drop in interest rates the increase was driven by 

• improved returns on limited partnerships and other private equity investments accounted for on the equity method in 2002 • 48 million of interest income received from the settlement of a prior year tax issue these improvements were offset by impairment writedowns for certain directly owned investments including those classified as otherthantemporary which were 73 million higher than the prior year investment income from our risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting segments primarily relating to funds held on behalf of clients decreased 49 million compared to 2001 largely due to declining interest rates 

expenses 

general expenses increased 13 over 2001 reflecting 

• growth of the businesses • higher costs in the us retail brokerage business • increased risk management and litigation reserve items • higher overall pension plan costs • costs related to the planned spinoff benefits to policyholders rose 264 million or 24 due to new business volume increases an increased payout ratio of benefits to policyholders versus net premiums earned issues related to nps and a shift in business mix to products with higher benefit payout ratios 

interest expense was down slightly due to lower shortterm interest rates 

amortization of intangible assets declined 104 million from 2001 as goodwill was not amortized in 2002 in accordance with fasb statement no 142 

income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest 

income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest increased significantly from 368 million in 2001 to 824 million in 2002 this increase is due primarily to the net change in expenses related to the world trade center 187 million the business transformation plan 224 million and the improvement in corporate and other revenue 150 million approximately 76 of aons 2002 consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest was from international operations 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 395 for 2001 and 37 for 2002 the decline from 2001 was due to the nondeductibility of certain goodwill which beginning in 2002 is no longer amortized for book purposes the overall effective tax rates are higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily because of state income tax provisions 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations increased to 486 million 171 per dilutive share from 183 million 066 per dilutive share in 2001 basic income from continuing operations per share was 172 and 067 for 2002 and 2001 respectively to compute income per share we have deducted dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stock from net income 

review by segment 

general 

aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments risk and insurance brokerage services consulting and insurance underwriting see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements aons operating segments are identified as those that 

• report separate financial information • are evaluated regularly when we are deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance we attribute revenues to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues 

segment revenue includes investment income as well as the impact of related derivatives generated by operating invested assets of that segment investment characteristics mirror liability characteristics of the respective segments 

• our risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting businesses invest funds held on behalf of clients and operating funds in shortterm obligations • in insurance underwriting policyholder claims and other types of noninterest sensitive insurance liabilities are primarily supported by intermediate to longterm fixedmaturity instruments investments underlying interestsensitive capital accumulation insurance liabilities are fixed or floatingrate fixedmaturity obligations for this business segment operating invested assets are approximately equal to average net policy liabilities • our insurance subsidiaries also have invested assets that exceed net policy liabilities in order to maintain solid claims paying ratings income from these investments are reflected in corporate and other segment revenues 37 

the following tables and commentary provide selected financial information on the operating segments 

 1 intersegment revenues of 68 million were eliminated in 2003 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements risk and insurance brokerage services 

aon is a leader in many sectors of the insurance industry globally it is the second largest insurance broker the largest reinsurance broker and the leading manager of captive insurance companies worldwide in the us aon is the largest wholesale broker and underwriting manager these rankings are based on the most recent surveys compiled and reports printed by business insurance  

the devastation caused by the attacks of september 11 2001 resulted in the largest insurance loss in history at the same time there was an unprecedented escalation of insurance premium rates because of larger than anticipated loss experience across most risks the stock markets steep decline lower interest rates and diminished risk capacity 

higher premium rates or a hard market generally result in increased commission revenues changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds however it is difficult to predict the longevity of the hard market and the rate of increase in premiums in the property and casualty marketplace has already begun to level off 

risk and insurance brokerage services generated approximately 58 of aons total operating segment revenues in 2003 revenues are generated primarily through 

• commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies • fees paid by clients • certain other carrier compensation • interest income on funds held on behalf of clients our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of 

• how our clients policy renewals are timed • the net effect of new and lost business • the timing of services provided to our clients 38 

• the income we earn on investments which is heavily influenced by shortterm interest rates with the exception of employee incentives expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year 

our retail brokerage companies operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with a large number of retail insurance brokerage and agency firms as well as individual brokers and agents and direct writers of insurance coverage specifically this segment 

• addresses the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of professional groups insurance companies service businesses governments healthcare providers commercial organizations and nonprofit groups among others • provides affinity products for professional liability life disability income and personal lines for individuals associations and businesses • provides wholesale brokerage managing underwriting and premium finance services to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients • offers claims management and loss cost management services to insurance companies and firms with selfinsurance programs • provides actuarial loss prevention and administrative services to businesses and consumers we review our product revenue results using the following subsegments 

• risk management and insurance brokerage — americas brokerage—americas encompasses our retail and wholesale brokerage services affinity products managing general underwriting placement and captive management services and premium finance services in north and south america the caribbean and bermuda • risk management and insurance brokerage—international brokerage—international  offers similar products and services to the rest of the world not identified above • reinsurance brokerage and related services reinsurance offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claim recoveries that • enhance the riskreturn characteristics of insurance policy portfolios • improve capital utilization • evaluate and mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide • claim services claims offers claims administration and loss cost management services the risk and insurance brokerage services segment revenues are influenced by the premiums paid by clients to insurers because we receive a percentage of the premiums as a commission in most cases the availability of insurance coverage can also affect our revenues if insurance coverage cannot be placed we do not receive a commission 

revenue 

total 2003 risk and insurance brokerage services revenue was 57 billion up 14 on a reported basis over last year excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates revenue rose 8 over last year operating revenue on an organic basis grew approximately 9 in a very competitive environment investment income decreased 34 million in 2003 from reduced derivative gains and lower interest rates 

continuing the trend from last year increases in insurance premium rates benefited revenues in 2003 after september 11 2001 insurance markets whose premium rates were rising already rose further as a result of restrictions on the availability of some coverages and the pressure on the financial strength of some insurance companies the property and casualty insurance market is very competitive as premium rates rise clients often retain more risk this dynamic has and may continue to limit revenue growth for pure brokerage services but it provides opportunities to offer more captive insurance and claims management services as well as safety and loss control services 

this chart details risk and insurance brokerage services revenue by subsegment

revenue 

in 2003 revenues of 12 billion increased 13 over 2002 excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates the growth rate was 9 revenue on an organic basis grew 5 from last year the organic revenue growth resulted from 

• growth in us compensation and international practices • the full year impact of a sizable human resources outsourcing agreement in third quarter 2002 aon entered into a sizeable new outsourcing contract with att that is expected to provide favorable returns over the life of the multiyear agreement the recognition of revenues and expenses however will significantly influence financial results over the contract period revenues are recorded on a gross basis inclusive of amounts ultimately passed through to subcontractors and are recorded ratably over the life of the contract upfront investment costs to support the new business cause pretax margins to be significantly lower in the early years of the multiyear contract compared with the later years when margins are expected to increase a significant portion of the upfront investment costs incurred for the new outsourcing contracts can be leveraged to handle increased business volume

this chart reconciles organic revenue growth to reported revenue growth 

 • the increase in benefits compensation management and communication consulting revenue was driven by positive foreign exchange rates and organic revenue growth in us compensation and benefits and international practices this increase was partially offset by a decline in management consulting • human resource outsourcing revenue improvement was due to the large contract initiated in third quarter 2002 this chart shows consulting revenue by geographic area and pretax income 

 • us revenue posted a strong increase in 2003 primarily reflecting the human resources outsourcing agreement initiated in third quarter 2002 • uk continent of europe and rest of world revenues rose on favorable currency exchange impacts and organic revenue growth income before income tax 

pretax income was 108 million a 10 decline from last year in 2003 pretax margins in this segment were 91 down from 114 in 2002 margins in this segment were reduced by 

• a revised cost allocation methodology resulting in higher expense allocations of 16 million over 2002 • increased pension and insurance costs • a nonrecurring stockbased expense adjustment the pretax margins for 2003 were also influenced by a lower margin human resources outsourcing contract as discussed above 

insurance underwriting 

the insurance underwriting segment 

• provides supplemental accident health and life insurance coverage mostly through direct distribution networks primarily through more than 7600 career insurance agents working for our subsidiaries our revenues are affected by our success in attracting and retaining these career agents the agency force turnover has remained fairly stable over time the sales management team is a strength that enables the recruiting model to remain effective • provides supplemental medicare policies in the us through a dedicated sales force • offers extended warranty and credit insurance products that are sold through retailers automotive dealers insurance agents and brokers and real estate brokers our revenues are also affected by the addition and retention of these retailers dealers agents and brokers • offers select commercial property and casualty business on a limited basis through managing general underwriters primarily aonowned companies • provides the administration of certain extended warranty services on automobiles electronic goods personal computers and appliances • has operations in the united states canada latin america europe and asiapacific • generated approximately 30 of aons total operating segment revenues in 2003 in the accident health and life operations we provide an array of accident sickness shortterm disability and other supplemental insurance products most of these products are primarily fixedindemnity obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation 

we have 

• developed relationships with select brokers and consultants to reach specific niche markets • expanded product distribution to include direct response programs affinity groups and worksite marketing which has created access to new markets and potential new policyholders • implemented a backtobasics strategy focusing on products and regions with predictable cash flows and the best return on investment • announced plans in february 2003 to place in runoff our accident and health insurance underwriting operations in latin america we stopped operations in argentina and have transitioned into runoff status in brazil and mexico during 2003 • transferred the large employer group life and accidental death business to a third party via an indemnity reinsurance arrangement • decided to run off certain noncore special risk accident and health business in the uk our warranty and credit subsidiaries in north america latin america europe and asiapacific provide warranties on automobiles and a variety of consumer goods including electronics and appliances in addition we provide nonstructural home warranties and other warranty products such as credit card enhancements and affinity warranty programs 

revenue 

written premiums and fees are the basis for organic revenue growth in this segment however reported revenues reflect earned premiums

 this chart reconciles organic revenue growth to reported revenue growth 

 1 the difference between written and earned premiums and fees as a percentage change was 0 for accident  health 2 for warranty and 1 for total revenue the change in warranty and total revenue also resulted from a onetime assumption of premiums ceded from a clients captive in 2002 45 

• revenue declined in accident  health and life for 2003 primarily due to our decision to — pursue a backtobasics strategy in the core businesses — run off the accident and health insurance underwriting operations in the latin american countries and to transfer our us large employer group life business these businesses generated approximately 14 million of revenues and 6 million of pretax losses in 2003 compared to 94 million in revenues and 22 million of pretax losses in 2002 we are exiting these businesses and expect to completely withdraw in 2005 we also decided to run off certain noncore special risk accident and health business in the uk • growth in the select property and casualty business as well european credit and warranty programs drove the revenue improvement in warranty credit and property  casualty overall core business growth was partially offset by 

• a decline in investment income of 47 million significantly impacted by a 27 million decline in interest earned on investments underlying deposittype contracts as that business has been placed in runoff • overall lower interest rates this chart details insurance underwriting revenue by geographic area and pretax income 

 • in 2003 us revenue declined primarily as a result of the runoff of our us large employer group life and accidental death business • uk continent of europe and rest of world posted significant revenue improvement during the year this increase is primarily the result of a favorable currency exchange rate impact and organic revenue growth in european direct sales warranty and credit operations income before income tax 

pretax income of 196 million increased 26 from 2002 pretax margins rose from 55 in 2002 to 68 in 2003 

increased pretax income and margin resulted from 

• higher expenses and charges concerning the planned divestiture of the insurance underwriting segment of 33 million in 2002 with no corresponding amounts in 2003 • improved profitability in the traditional lines of accident  health and life • provision for nonclaims litigation issues of 15 million in 2002 with no corresponding amount in 2003 • reduced losses in europe warranty and improvements in property  casualty excluding nps 46 

these increases were partially offset by 

• charges related to losses and reserve strengthening for the nps runoff program which were 65 million in 2003 versus a 36 million charge in 2002 • a revised cost allocation methodology which resulted in increased expense allocations of 12 million for 2003 corporate and other 

corporate and other segment revenue consists primarily of investment income including income or loss on disposals including otherthantemporary impairment losses which is not otherwise reflected in the operating segments this segment includes 

• invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting businesses • the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries and related income corporate and other segment revenue includes income from endurance common stock accounted for under the equity method and changes in the valuation of endurance warrants aon carries its investment in endurance warrants at fair value and records changes in the fair value through corporate and other segment revenue in accordance with fasb statement no 133 

private equities are principally carried at cost except where aon has significant influence in which case they are carried under the equity method these investments usually do not pay dividends 

limited partnerships lp are accounted for under the equity method and changes in the value of the underlying lp investments flow through corporate and other segment revenue because the lp investments include exchangetraded securities corporate and other segment revenue fluctuates with the market values of underlying publicly traded equity investments lp investments have historically provided higher returns over a longer time than broad market common stock however in the short run the returns are inherently more variable in december 2001 we securitized 450 million of our lp investments plus associated lp commitments which represented the majority of our lp interests this transaction has lessened the variability of revenue reported in this segment see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization 

although our portfolios are highly diversified they still remain exposed to market equity and credit risk 

we 

• periodically review securities with material unrealized losses and evaluate them for otherthan temporary impairments • analyze various risk factors and determine if any specific asset impairments exist if we determine there is a specific asset impairment we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value • review invested assets with material unrealized losses each quarter see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding otherthantemporary impairments 47 

this chart shows the components of corporate and other revenue and expenses 

 revenue 

corporate and other revenue improved by 146 million to 125 million in 2003 the revenue improvement was primarily driven by 

• an 80 million noncash increase in the value of the endurance stock warrants • equity earnings from the endurance common stock investment of 46 million compared to 21 million in 2002 • lower impairment writedowns of certain fixedmaturity and equity investments of 36 million in 2003 versus 130 million in 2002 including 51 million cumulative effect of the change in policy relating to prior periods these positive comparisons were somewhat offset by 48 million of interest on a tax settlement in 2002 with no comparable amount in 2003 

loss before income tax 

corporate and other expenses were 148 million an improvement of 73 million from the comparable period in 2002 this improvement is the result of 

• a decline in interest expense of 23 million primarily from the paydown of both longterm and shortterm debt as a result of the adoption of fin 46 on december 31 2003 we increased our notes payable balance by 726 million for subordinated debt owed to aon capital a which was deconsolidated effective december 31 2003 there was no effect on net income in 2003 as a result of this deconsolidation however beginning in 2004 the interest on this subordinated debt previously reflected as minority interest net of tax on the consolidated statements of income will be shown as interest expense see notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information • a decline in general expenses of 36 million due in part to 17 million of 2002 overhead costs for the previous planned divestiture of the underwriting businesses with no corresponding 2003 amount 48 

• a net 14 million credit related to the world trade center to allow us to resume business operations and minimize the loss caused by the disaster we secured temporary office space in manhattan later we leased permanent space and during first quarter 2003 we assigned this temporary space to another company the costs related to this assignment were 46 million pretax in fourth quarter 2003 we reached a final settlement of approximately 200 million for our overall world trade center property insurance claim we received a cash payment of approximately 92 million during the fourth quarter in addition to the 108 million we had already collected as a result we recognized a 60 million pretax gain on this settlement these revenue and expense comparisons contributed to the overall corporate and other pretax loss of 23 million in 2003 versus a loss of 242 million in 2002 

financial condition and liquidity 

liquidity 

our routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and paying dividends on outstanding stock our primary source for meeting these requirements is from dividends and internal financing from our operating subsidiaries after meeting our routine dividend and debt servicing requirements we used a portion of the remaining funding we received throughout the year for capital expenditures made an early 100 million us pension plan contribution and invested in acquisitions our major us insurance subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at yearend 2003 exceeded the riskbased capital target set by the naic by a satisfactory level 

in 2003 in order to enhance their financial position we did not dividend any of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries earnings to aon parent company during the past year the statutory capital and surplus of the total underwriting companies has improved substantially we anticipate that dividend payments to aon parent company will resume in 2004 from cica our major insurance subsidiary note 11 to the consolidated financial statements discusses regulatory restrictions relating to dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries 

in the aggregate our operating subsidiaries anticipate that there will be adequate liquidity to meet their needs in the foreseeable future and to provide funds to the parent company we have used cash flow primarily for debt reduction dividend payments business reinvestment and acquisition financing 

we expect our subsidiaries positive cash flow to continue and with it our ability to access adequate shortterm lines of credit 

cash on our statements of financial position includes funds available for general corporate purposes and funds we are holding on behalf of clients and to satisfy policyholder liabilities 

in 2003 total cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans were 217 million an increase of 141 million over 2002 this exceeded the original expectation due to an early contribution of 100 million to the us defined benefit pension plan in fourth quarter 2003 no corresponding early contributions were made in 2002 under current rules and assumptions we anticipate that 2004 contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans will be approximately 195 million however legislation being considered by the us congress will relieve some of these requirements if passed if so we expect our 2004 contributions to our major defined benefit plans will be approximately 170 million 

in connection with one of our uk pension plans our principal uk subsidiary has agreed with the trustees of the plan to contribute £20 million per year to the plan for six years with the amount payable increasing by 53 on each january 1 commencing in 2005 these contributions are in addition to the normal employer contributions to the plan the trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our uk subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding up 

deficit in practice the trustees have accepted the agreed schedule of contributions and have not requested such an advance as of december 31 2002 the estimated winding up deficit was £340 million the winding up deficit has not yet been determined as of december 31 2003 at the last valuation date september 30 2003 the estimated deficit between the value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation calculated under us gaap was £134 million of which £125 million was recorded as a minimum pension liability in 1999 all uk pension plans were closed to new entrants 

cash flows 

cash flows from operations represent the net income we earned in the reported periods adjusted for noncash revenue and charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities cash flows provided by operating activities for 2003 were 13 billion however not all of these funds were available for use by us 

the operating cash flow from our insurance subsidiaries of approximately 360 million was not available for general corporate purposes in 2003 to enhance their financial position we decided not to dividend in 2003 any of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries earnings to the aon parent company also included in the 360 million was a 305 million change in operating assets and liabilities of the underwriting segment net of reinsurance primarily from unearned premiums and other fees these funds will be used to satisfy future benefits to policyholders with the remainder being available after taxes and other income and expense to dividend to aon parent company in future years 

in our risk and insurance brokerage and consulting businesses we collect cash payments from clients that include both premiums payable to insurance companies for policies they issue and commissions and fees payable to us for our brokerage and consulting services we record the commissions and fees as income and we hold clients premiums for a short time before remitting them to insurers the net increase in funds held on behalf of clients was approximately 200 million in 2003 the net balance for these funds is reflected in other receivables and liabilities — net in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

proceeds of 48 million from the sale of operations included 30 million from the divestiture of sheffield which was sold for approximately book value 

in 2003 available cash flows from operations were used primarily to 

• pay down debt of 385 million • pay cash dividends of 190 million • provide for capital expenditures of 185 million • fund acquisitions of 56 million included in cash flows from operations are cash contributions to our major defined benefit pension plans of 217 million versus expense of 187 million 

financial condition 

since yearend 2002 total assets increased 17 billion to 27 billion 

in 2003 total investments increased 738 million to 73 billion from december 31 2002 fixed maturities increased 662 million primarily relating to an asset management program at our insurance underwriting subsidiaries that became effective in second quarter 2003 which resulted in a shift from shortterm to longterm investments as a consequence of this decision shortterm investments in the insurance underwriting businesses decreased but were offset by changes in foreign exchange rates along with an increase in funds held on behalf of clients resulting in an overall decline of 20 million 

risk and insurance brokerage services and consulting receivables increased 177 million in 2003 corresponding insurance premiums payable increased 464 million over the same period these increases reflect 

• the effect of foreign exchange rates • the timing of receipts and payments • the continued rise in premium rates across most lines of business • escalating client demand for risk programs • aons overall new account growth other assets increased 90 million from december 31 2002 other assets are comprised principally of prepaid premiums related to reinsurance prepaid pension assets and in 2002 assets of discontinued operations related to our automotive finance servicing business 

policy liabilities in total excluding other policyholder funds increased 703 million which were principally offset by corresponding increases in reinsurance receivables reflected in other receivables and prepaid premiums related to reinsurance 

other policyholder funds decreased 81 million from 2002 due primarily to interest sensitive and deposittype contracts maturing and our decision to stop offering these programs 

our minimum defined benefit pension liability included in other liabilities increased 262 million since last yearend we are required to maintain at plan level at a minimum a liability equal to the difference between the present value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations 

investments 

we invest in broad asset categories related to our diversified operations in managing our investments our objective is to maximize earnings while monitoring asset and liability durations interest and credit risks and regulatory requirements we maintain wellcapitalized operating companies the financial strength of these companies permits a diversified investment portfolio including invested cash fixedincome obligations public and private equities and limited partnerships 

the corporate and other segment contains invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the insurance brokerage and consulting businesses together with the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the underwriting business and related income these insurance assets which are publicly traded equities as well as less liquid private equities and limited partnerships represent a more aggressive investment strategy that gives us an opportunity for greater returns with longerterm investments these assets owned by the insurance underwriting companies 

• are necessary to support strong claims paying ratings by independent rating agencies 51 

• are unavailable for other uses such as debt reduction or share repurchases without considering regulatory requirements see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in december 2001 we securitized 450 million of our lp investments and associated lp commitments which represented most of our limited partnership investments via a sale of peps i the securitization 

• gives our underwriting subsidiaries greater liquidity • has lessened the revenue variability in the corporate and other segment see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments 

borrowings 

total debt at december 31 2003 was 21 billion up 360 million from december 31 2002 specifically 

• notes payable increased by 424 million compared to yearend 2002 this increase — is primarily due to deconsolidating our mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities as a result of fin 46 see notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion which resulted in increasing our notes payable balance by 726 million — was partially offset by retiring 300 million of outstanding debt securities due in january and june 2003 • shortterm debt declined 64 million primarily due to a decrease in foreign shortterm debt in january 2004 we also retired the balance of our 63 debt securities 89 million which had become due 

contractual maturities of notes payable and operating lease commitments with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2002 we completed an offering of 300 million aggregate principal amount of 35 convertible senior debentures due 2012 the debentures are unsecured obligations and are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately 21475 per common share under certain circumstances including the following 

• during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 120 of the conversion price ie 2577 for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter or 

• subject to certain exceptions during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per 1000 principal amount of the debentures for each day of the ten trading day period was less than 95 of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of 1000 principal amount of the debentures aon has reserved approximately 14 million shares for the potential conversion of these debentures 

we received approximately 223 million by privately placing 225 million aggregate principal amount of 7375 senior notes due 2012 in fourth quarter 2002 in may 2003 we completed an offer to exchange these notes for notes registered under the securities act of 1933 that have identical terms 

in 2002 we renegotiated our backup lines of credit anticipating the spinoff of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries we reduced our line of credit to 875 million as a result of our capital enhancement actions we renegotiated our shortterm backup lines of credit reducing the total amount to 775 million in february 2003 the agreement expires in 2005 

in fourth quarter 2002 the credit rating agencies lowered the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper on october 31 2002 moodys investors service lowered its rating of our senior debt to the current rating of baa2 from baa1 moodys also placed the rating of our senior debt and the p2 rating of our commercial paper under review for possible future downgrade which it subsequently removed without change also on october 31 2002 standard  poors ratings services placed its a rating of our senior debt on creditwatch with negative implications which it subsequently removed without change on august 31 2003 standard  poors revised its outlook on our senior debt from stable to negative a further downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility 

any such further downgrade may trigger a further obligation of our company to fund an aggregate of up to 75 million with respect to our premium finance securitizations moreover some of our debt instruments such as our 620 notes due january 2007 250 million of which are outstanding expressly provide for interest rate increases in the case of certain ratings downgrades similarly any such downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether if we cannot access the commercial paper market although we have committed backup lines in excess of our current outstanding commercial paper borrowings we cannot assure you that it would not adversely affect our financial position a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt may also adversely affect the claimspaying ability or financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries 

the major rating agencies ratings of our debt securities at december 31 2003 appear in the table below standard and poors outlook on aon is negative ratings from moodys investor services and fitch inc are on stable outlook 



aons principal insurance underwriting subsidiaries are rated a with a stable outlook by am best for their claims paying ability 

stockholders equity 

stockholders equity increased 603 million during 2003 to 45 billion primarily reflecting 

• 628 million of net income before preferred dividends • a 231 million after tax foreign exchange benefit these equity increases were partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders of 190 million 

accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased 93 million since december 31 2002 net foreign exchange losses improved by 231 million because of the weakening us dollar against foreign currencies as compared to the prior yearend net derivative gains increased 28 million over yearend 2002 net unrealized investment gains rose 20 million during 2003 

during 2003 some of our defined benefit pension plans particularly in the uk incurred losses due to reduced discount rates accounting principles generally accepted in the us require a company to maintain at a minimum a liability on its balance sheet equal to the difference between the present 

value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations at yearend 2003 this increased pension obligation caused a 186 million aftertax reduction to stockholders equity we maintain the related pension plan assets in separate trust accounts they are not part of our consolidated financial statements this noncash adjustment did not affect 2003 earnings 

for 2004 we project 

• our pension expense for our major defined benefit plans to be approximately 225 million this expense was significantly affected by a lower discount rate • cash contributions to the major defined benefit pension plans will be approximately 195 million at december 31 2003 stockholders equity per share was 1432 up from 1256 at december 31 2002 due principally to net income for 2003 our total debt and preferred securities as a percentage of total capital is 33 at december 31 2003 compared to 40 at yearend 2002 

off balance sheet arrangements 

we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 

aon and its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately 90 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties we accrue amounts in our consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable 

we use special purpose entities and qualifying special purpose entities qspe also known as special purpose vehicles in some of our operations following the guidance of fasb statement no 140 and other relevant accounting guidance 

premium financing 

some of our special purpose vehicles were formed solely to purchase financing receivables and sell those balances to conduits owned and managed by thirdparty financial institutions subject to certain limitations agreements allow us to sell to these conduit vehicles through december 2005 as of december 31 2003 the maximum commitment contained in these agreements was 19 billion 

under the agreements we sell the receivables to the conduits consequently the conduits bear the credit risks on the receivables subject to limited recourse in the form of credit loss reserves provided by our subsidiaries and which we guarantee under the guarantee provisions our maximum cash requirement was approximately 75 million at december 31 2003 the us facility was renewed in july 2003 and the european facility was renewed in october 2003 the us facility was increased by 100 million and for both facilities aons percentage guarantee was reduced replaced by a collateral enhancement we intend to renew these conduit facilities when they expire if there are adverse bank regulatory tax or accounting rule changes our access to the conduit facilities and special purpose vehicles would be restricted these special purpose vehicles are not included in our consolidated financial statements 

peps i 

on december 31 2001 we sold the vast majority of our lp portfolio valued at 450 million to peps i a qspe the common stock interest in peps i is held by a limited liability company owned by one of our subsidiaries 49 and by a charitable trust which we do not control established for victims of the september 11 th attacks 51 

peps sold approximately 171 million of investment grade fixedmaturity securities to unaffiliated third parties it then paid our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the 171 million in cash and issued them an additional 279 million in fixedmaturity and preferred stock securities 

standard  poors ratings services rated the fixedmaturity securities our subsidiaries received from peps i as investment grade as part of this transaction the insurance companies must purchase from peps i additional fixedmaturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded lp commitments as they are requested approximately 20 million of these commitments were funded in 2003 as of december 31 2003 the unfunded commitments amounted to 80 million these commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments 

based on the rating agencies downgrades of aons credit ratings in october 2002 on aons senior debt credit support agreements were purchased in january 2003 whereby 100 million of cash of one of our underwriting subsidiaries has been pledged as collateral for these commitments this collateral has been reduced to 77 million at december 31 2003 

if the insurance companies fail to purchase additional fixedmaturity securities as commitments are drawn down we have guaranteed their purchase 

subsequent to closing the securitization one of the insurance subsidiaries sold peps i fixedmaturity securities with a value of 20 million to aon the assets and liabilities and operations of peps i are not included in our consolidated financial statements 

aon has recognized otherthantemporary impairment writedowns equal to the original cost of one tranche including 32 million in 2002 and 27 million in first quarter 2003 the preferred stock interest represents a beneficial interest in the securitized limited partnership investments the fair value of the private preferred stock interests depends on the value of the limited partnership investments held by peps i management assesses otherthantemporary declines in the fair value below cost using a financial model that considers 

• the value of the underlying limited partnership investments of peps i • the nature and timing of the cash flows from the underlying limited partnership investments of peps i combined global funding 

in 1998 cica an aon subsidiary formed combined global funding llc a cayman islandsbased special purpose entity spe to issue notes to investors under a european mediumterm note program emtn the proceeds of the notes were used to purchase funding agreement policies issued by cica the contract terms of the funding agreement mirror the terms of the trust mediumterm notes historically the spe has been consolidated by cica based on the guidance in arb 51 and eitf topic d14 with the emtns being classified as a policyholder liability in aons consolidated financial statements rather than notes payable given that the liquidation preference of the underlying debt more closely resembled the characteristics of a policyholder liability the interest expense on the emtns has been included in benefits to policyholders in the consolidated statements of income the amounts of emtns outstanding at december 31 2003 and 2002 were 50 million and 79 million respectively in 2005 the remaining outstanding emtn and the corresponding funding agreement are scheduled to be redeemed 

upon the adoption of fin 46 aon has determined that the spe is a vie and cica is not the primary beneficiary because cica does not have a variable interest in the spe as a result cica was required to deconsolidate the trust on december 31 2003 there was no effect on the consolidated statements of financial position or income statements as a result of this deconsolidation as the funding agreement liability between cica and the spe is now classified as a policyholder liability

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings cash flows and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity prices in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures we enter into a variety of derivative instruments aon does not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies used to manage these risks a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives is included in notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars our primary exposures are to the british pound the euro the canadian dollar and the australian dollar we use overthecounter otc options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations 

additionally some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies our uk subsidiary earns approximately 60 of its revenue in us dollars but the majority of its expenses are incurred in pounds sterling our policy is to convert into pounds sterling sufficient us dollar revenue to fund the subsidiarys pound sterling expenses using overthecounter otc options and forward exchange contracts at december 31 2003 we have hedged 80 of the uk subsidiaries expected us dollar transaction exposure for the next twelve months we do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years 

the impact to 2003 and 2002 pretax income in the event of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the respective quoted yearend exchange rates would not be material after consideration of derivative positions 

the nature of the income of our businesses is affected by changes in international and domestic shortterm interest rates we monitor our net exposure to shortterm interest rates and as appropriate hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments a hypothetical instantaneous parallel 

decrease in the period end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease net of derivative positions of 9 million and 14 million to 2003 and 2002 pretax income respectively 

the valuation of our fixedmaturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk a hypothetical 1 increase in longterm interest rates would decrease the fair value of the portfolio at december 31 2003 and 2002 by approximately 90 million and 85 million respectively we have notes payable and preferred securities outstanding with a fair value of 23 billion and 24 billion at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively this fair value was greater than the carrying value by 234 million and 36 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively a hypothetical 1 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value by approximately 7 and 6 at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

the valuation of our marketable equity security portfolio is subject to equity price risk if market prices were to decrease by 10 the fair value of the equity portfolio would have a corresponding decrease of 4 million at december 31 2003 compared to 6 million at december 31 2002 at december 31 2003 and 2002 there were no outstanding derivatives hedging the price risk on the equity portfolio 

we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity market prices in order to illustrate the possible impact of these changes we are not predicting market events we believe that these changes in rates and prices are reasonably possible over a oneyear period

operating  subsidiaries of aon group conduct business may require  individual or
company  licensing  to act  as  brokers  agents  third  party  administrators
managing general agents reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters under the laws
of most states in the united  states and in most foreign  countries  regulatory
authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting  renewing
and revoking  brokers and agents licenses to transact business in the state or
country  the manner of operating in  particular  states and  countries may vary
according to the  licensing  requirements  of the  particular  state or country
which may  require  among  other  things  that a firm  operate in the state or
country through a local corporation in a few states and countries licenses are
issued only to individual residents or locallyowned  business entities in such
cases  aon group  subsidiaries  have  arrangements  with  residents or business
entities licensed to act in the state or country

         insurance  companies  must  comply  with  laws and  regulations  of the
jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are designed
to ensure  financial  solvency of  insurance  companies  and to require fair and
adequate  service and  treatment  for  policyholders  they are  enforced by the

         the state insurance  regulators are members of the national association
of insurance  commissioners  naic  the naic seeks to promote uniformity of
and to  enhance  the  state  regulation  of  insurance  both  the naic and the
individual  states continue to focus on the solvency of insurance  companies and
their  conduct  in the  market  place  this focus is  reflected  in  additional
regulatory  oversight by the states and emphasis on the enactment or adoption of
a series of naic model laws and regulations  designed to promote  solvency  the
naic  revised  its  accounting  practices  and  procedures  manual  in a process
referred to as codification  the revised manual was effective  january 1 2001
the domiciliary  states of aons major insurance  subsidiaries  have adopted the
provisions  of the revised  manual  the  revised  manual has  changed  to some
extent prescribed statutory accounting practices and resulted in changes to the
accounting  practices  that aons major  insurance  subsidiaries  use to prepare
their statutorybasis financial statements the impact of these changes to aons
major insurance  subsidiaries was to increase the statutory  capital and surplus
by 54 million as of january 1 2001

         several years ago the naic developed a formula for analyzing  insurers
called  riskbased  capital  rbc  rbc is  intended to  establish  minimum
capital  threshold  levels  that  vary  with  the  size  and mix of a  companys
business  it is designed to identify companies with the capital levels that may
require  regulatory  attention  rbc does not have any significant impact on the
insurance business of the registrant

approval of the domestic state insurance department of intracorporate  transfers
of assets  within  the  holding  company  structure  including  the  payment of
dividends by insurance company  subsidiaries  in addition  the premium finance
loans by cananwill inc an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of the registrant
are subject to one or more of truthinlending and credit regulations insurance
premium finance acts  retail  installment sales acts and other similar consumer
protection  legislation  failure to comply  with such laws or  regulations  can
result in the temporary  suspension or permanent  loss of the right to engage in
business in a particular jurisdiction as well as other penalties

         recent  federal  and  state  laws  and  proposals   mandating  specific
practices by medical  insurers and the health care industry will not because of
the nature of the business of the registrants  subsidiaries  materially affect
the registrant  numerous  states have had legislation  introduced to reform the
health care system and such  legislation has passed in several states  while it
is impossible to forecast the precise  nature of future federal and state health
care changes  the  registrant  does not expect a major impact on its operations
because  of the  supplemental  nature  of most  of the  policies  issued  by its
insurance  subsidiaries  and because the coverages  are  primarily  purchased to
provide  on  a  fixedindemnity  basis   protection  against  lossoftime  or
disability  benefits  congress has passed the financial services  modernization
act commonly known as s 900 or the gramm  leach  bliley act while s 900 makes
substantial  changes in  allowing  financial  organizations  to  diversify  the
registrant  does not believe its  enactment  will have a material  effect on the

consolidated financial statements on page 40 of the annual report


licensing and regulation

      regulatory  authorities  in the states or countries in which the operating
subsidiaries  of aon group  conduct  business may require  individual or company
licensing  to act as  brokers  agents  third  party  administrators  managing
general agents  reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters under the laws of most
states  in  the  united  states  and  in  most  foreign  countries   regulatory
authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting  renewing
and revoking  brokers and agents licenses to transact business in the state or
country  the manner of operating in  particular  states and  countries may vary
according to the  licensing  requirements  of the  particular  state or country
which may  require  among  other  things  that a firm  operate in the state or
country through a local corporation in a few states and countries licenses are
issued only to individual residents or locallyowned  business entities in such
cases  aon group  subsidiaries  have  arrangements  with  residents or business
entities licensed to act in the state or country

      insurance   companies  must  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  of  the
jurisdictions in which they do business these laws and regulations are designed
to ensure  financial  solvency of  insurance  companies  and to require fair and
adequate  service and  treatment  for  policyholders  they are  enforced by the
states in the united states by industry  selfregulating agencies in the united
kingdom  and by various  regulatory  agencies  in other  countries  through the
granting  and  revoking  of  licenses  to  do  business  licensing  of  agents
monitoring  of  trade  practices  policy  form  approval  minimum  loss  ratio
requirements  limits on premium and commission  rates  and minimum reserve and
capital requirements compliance is monitored by the state insurance departments
through periodic regulatory reporting procedures and periodic examinations  the
quarterly and annual  financial  reports to the  regulators in the united states
utilize statutory  accounting  principles which are different from the generally
accepted  accounting  principles used in  stockholders  reports  the statutory
accounting  principles  in keeping with the intent to assure the  protection of
policyholders  are based in general  on a liquidation  concept while generally
accepted accounting principles are based on a goingconcern concept

      the state insurance  regulators are members of the national association of
insurance  commissioners  naic this association seeks to promote uniformity
of and to enhance the state  regulation  of  insurance  both the naic and the
individual  states continue to focus on the solvency of insurance  companies and
their  conduct  in the  market  place  this focus is  reflected  in  additional
regulatory  oversight by the states and emphasis on the enactment or adoption of
a series of naic model laws and regulations  designed to promote  solvency  the
naic  revised  the  accounting  practices  and  procedures  manual  in a process
referred to as  codification  the revised manual is effective  january 1 2001
the domiciliary  states of aons major insurance  subsidiaries  have adopted the


page
provisions  of the revised  manual  the  revised  manual has  changed  to some
extent  prescribed statutory accounting practices and will result in changes to
the accounting practices that aons major insurance  subsidiaries use to prepare
their statutorybasis financial statements the impact of these changes to aons
major  insurance  subsidiaries  statutory  capital and surplus as of january 1
2001 is not expected to be significant

      several  years ago the naic  developed a formula for  analyzing  insurers
called  riskbased  capital  rbc  rbc is  intended to  establish  minimum
capital  threshold  levels  that  vary  with  the  size  and mix of a  companys
business  it is designed to identify companies with the capital levels that may
require  regulatory  attention  rbc does not have any significant impact on the
insurance business of the registrant

      the state  insurance  holding  company  laws  require  prior notice to and
approval of the domestic state insurance department of intracorporate  transfers
of assets  within  the  holding  company  structure  including  the  payment of
dividends by insurance company  subsidiaries  in addition  the premium finance
loans by cananwill inc an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of the registrant
are subject to one or more of truthinlending and credit regulations insurance
premium finance acts  retail  installment sales acts and other similar consumer
protection  legislation  failure to comply  with such laws or  regulations  can
result in the temporary  suspension or permanent  loss of the right to engage in
business in a particular jurisdiction as well as other penalties

      recent federal and state laws and proposals  mandating  specific practices
by medical insurers and the health care industry will not because of the nature
of  the  business  of  the  registrants  subsidiaries  materially  affect  the
registrant numerous states have had legislation introduced to reform the health
care  system and such  legislation  has passed in  several  states  while it is
impossible  to forecast  the precise  nature of future  federal and state health
care changes  the  registrant  does not expect a major impact on its operations
because  of the  supplemental  nature  of most  of the  policies  issued  by its
insurance  subsidiaries  and because the coverages  are  primarily  purchased to
provide  on  a  fixedindemnity  basis   protection  against  lossoftime  or
disability  benefits  congress has passed the financial services  modernization
act commonly known as s 900 or the gramm  leach  bliley act while s 900 makes
substantial  changes in  allowing  financial  organizations  to  diversify  the
registrant  does not believe the enactment of s 900 will have a material  effect
on the business of its insurance subsidiaries


clientele

      no significant part of the registrants or its  subsidiaries  business is
dependent upon a single client or on a few clients the loss of any one of which
would have a material adverse effect on the registrant


employees

      the registrants  subsidiaries had  approximately  51000 employees at the
end of 2000 of whom  approximately  43000 are salaried and hourly employees and
the remaining  8000 are sales  representatives  who are  generally  compensated
wholly or primarily by commission










item 2  properties

      the  registrants  subsidiaries  own and occupy  office  buildings in four
states and certain  foreign  countries  and lease office space elsewhere in the
united  states and in various  foreign  cities  loss of the use of any owned or
leased property while potentially disruptive  would have no material impact on
the registrant
