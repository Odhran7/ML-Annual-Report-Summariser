backlog 

the company’s backlog is applicable to its sales of systems and services at september 30 2022 the backlog was 117 billion of which 111 billion was attributable to the field business the backlog amount outstanding at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year 

at september 30 2022 remaining performance obligations were 175 billion which is 58 billion higher than the companys backlog of 117 billion differences between the company’s remaining performance obligations and backlog are primarily due to the following 

• remaining performance obligations include large multipurpose contracts to construct hospitals schools and other governmental buildings which are services to be performed over the buildings lifetime with average initial contract terms of 25 to 35 years for the entire term of the contract versus backlog which includes only the lifecycle period of these contracts which approximates five years 

• remaining performance obligations exclude certain customer contracts with a term of one year or less and contracts that are cancelable without substantial penalty versus backlog which includes shortterm and cancelable contracts and 

• remaining performance obligations include the full remaining term of service contracts with substantial termination penalties versus backlog which includes one year for all outstanding service contracts 

the company will continue to report backlog as it believes it is a useful measure of evaluating the companys operational performance and relationship to total orders 

raw materials 

raw materials used by the company’s businesses in connection with their operations include steel aluminum brass copper polypropylene and certain flurochemicals used in fire suppression agents the company also uses semiconductors and other electronic components in the manufacture of its products during fiscal 2022 the company experienced material cost increases due to global inflation supply chain disruptions labor shortages increased demand and other regulatory and macroeconomic factors these trends had an unfavorable impact on the company’s results of operations in fiscal 2022 as discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company believes that the macroeconomic trends experienced in fiscal 2022 will continue into fiscal 2023 therefore the company could experience further disruptions shortages and price inflation in the future the effect of which will depend on the company’s ability to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these events in fiscal 2023 commodity prices and availability could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the company’s results of operations for a more detailed description of the risks related to the availability of raw materials components and commodities see item 1a risk factors 

intellectual property 

generally the company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by contracts licenses confidentiality or other agreements from time to time the company takes action to protect its businesses by asserting its intellectual property rights against thirdparty infringers 

the company owns numerous us and nonus patents and their respective counterparts the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products while the company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset no single 

patent or group of patents is critical to the success of the business the company from time to time grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others 

the company’s trademarks certain of which are material to its business are registered or otherwise legally protected in the us and many nonus countries where products and services of the company are sold the company from time to time becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions

environmental health and safety matters 

laws addressing the protection of the environment and workers’ safety and health govern the company’s ongoing global operations they generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where companyrelated materials have been released into the environment 

a portion of the company’s products consume energy and use refrigerants increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these regulations tend to be implemented under global national and subnational climate objectives or policies and target the global warming potential “gwp” of refrigerants equipment energy efficiency and the combustion of fossil fuels as a heating source the company continues to invest in its product portfolio to meet emerging emissions regulations and standards 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the company’s businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances 

the company’s operations and facilities have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties see note 21 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters 

government regulation and supervision 

the companys operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the united states in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states and nonus jurisdictions in which the company operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries the companys security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals wireline and wireless telephone companies in the us are regulated by the federal and state governments in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact the companys fire businesses the company’s businesses may also be affected by changes in governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards noise regulation and product safety regulations including changes related to hydro fluorocarbonsemissions reduction efforts energy conservation standards and the regulation of fluorinated gases these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the company conducts its business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect the companys worldwide operations both favorably and unfavorably for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the companys business see item 1a risk factors 

regulatory capital expenditures 

the company’s efforts to comply with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations applicable to its business and products often results in capital expenditures the company makes capital expenditures to design and upgrade its fire and security products to comply with or exceed standards applicable to the alarm fire suppression and security industries the company also makes capital expenditures to meet or exceed energy efficiency standards including the regulation of refrigerants hydro fluorocarbonsemissions reductions efforts and the regulation of fluorinated gasses particularly with respect 

to the company’s hvac products and solutions the company’s ongoing environmental compliance program also results in capital expenditures regulatory and environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions however expenditures in fiscal 2022 related solely to regulatory compliance were not material it is management’s expectation that the amount of any future capital expenditures related to compliance with any individual regulation or grouping of related regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year see note 21 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters

 item 1a   risk factors 

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” the disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted to imply that such risk has not already materialized additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial may also impair the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to macroeconomic and political conditions 

economic political credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to grow or sustain our business and our ability to access the capital markets 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets global economic and political conditions affect each of our primary businesses and the businesses of our customers and suppliers recessions economic downturns price instability inflation slowing economic growth and social and political instability in the industries andor markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods result in future restructuring charges and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our business for example current macroeconomic and political instability caused by the conflict between russia and ukraine global supply chain disruptions inflation and the strengthening of the us dollar have and could continue to adversely impact our results of operations other potential consequences arising from the russiaukraine conflict and its effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy cannot be predicted this may include further sanctions embargoes regional instability geopolitical shifts energy instability potential retaliatory action by the russian government increased cybersecurity attacks increased tensions among countries in which we operate 

the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide a worldwide economic downturn andor disruption of the credit markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings prevailing industry conditions the volatility of the capital markets or other factors then our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to adequately react to negative economic impacts that decrease demand for our products and services andor negative movements in capital markets our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

much of the demand for installation of hvac security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit commercial and residential real estate markets are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values and increases in prevailing interest rates could lead to significant reductions in the demand for and availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors could in turn temper demand for new hvac fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance are dependent on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing the businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries tend to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy component and commodity prices commodity and component availability and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services as projects are postponed or cancelled although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers increases in prevailing interest rates or disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could significantly raise the cost of new debt for our customers any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect 

on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers inside and outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse or stagnant economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 

increases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed therefore in the shortterm our ability to adjust for changes in certain commodity prices is limited in these cases if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supplybased fixedprice contracts we use commodity hedge contracts to minimize overall price risk associated with our anticipated commodity purchases unfavorability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level additionally to the extent we do not or are unable to hedge certain commodities and the commodity prices substantially increase such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased commodity costs as a result of global macroeconomic trends including global price inflation supply chain disruption and the russiaukraine conflict while we have taken action to offset increasing commodity costs as described above we have nonetheless experienced negative impacts on profitability as a result of such increased costs continued increases in commodity costs could negatively impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of increased costs 

risks associated with our nonus operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the us some of which are located in emerging markets longterm economic and geopolitical uncertainty in any of the regions of the world in which we operate such as asia south america the middle east europe and emerging markets could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements 

in addition as a result of our global presence a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period during 2022 we experienced a reduction in revenue and profits as a result of the significant strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies the continued strength of the us dollar could continue to adversely impact our revenue and profit in nonus jurisdictions 

there are other risks that are inherent in our nonus operations including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions laws and regulations including antitrust import export labor and environmental laws and monetary and fiscal policies the ability to enforce rights collect revenues and protect assets in foreign jurisdictions protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures or impact trade volumes unsettled or unstable political conditions international conflict governmentimposed plant or other operational shutdowns backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions corruption natural and manmade disasters hazards and losses violence civil and labor unrest and possible terrorist attacks 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

impacts related to the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the covid19 global pandemic created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in response to the challenges presented by covid19 we modified our business practices and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers these actions may cause us to experience increases in costs reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines 

vaccine mandates and testing requirements have been implemented in some jurisdictions where we operate in addition a number of our customers have issued vaccine requirements with respect to our employees who provide onsite service at customer facilities our efforts to comply with these or other mandates could result in increased labor attrition and disruption as well as difficulty securing future labor needs and could materially impact our ability to deliver services to our customers which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations 

we may also experience impacts from market forces and changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears as a result of covid19 challenges in achieving sufficient vaccination levels and the introduction of new variants of covid19 have and could continue to negatively impact our results of operations due to the extension or reinstitution of lockdowns and similar restrictive measures limited access to customer sites to perform installation and service work the delay or abandonment of projects on which we provide products andor services and the general adverse impacts on demand and sales volumes from industries that are sensitive to economic downturns and volatility in commodity prices for example the company has experienced and could continue to experience disruptions to its business in china due to the application of lockdowns and other restrictive measures under chinas zerocovid policy further the covid19 pandemic could result in permanent changes in the behaviors of our customers including the increased prevalence of remote work and a corresponding decline in demand for the construction and maintenance of commercial buildings any of these impacts could adversely affect our results of operations 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the resurgence of covid19 and its variants the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and the speed at which populations are vaccinated impacts on economic activity and regulatory actions taken to mitigate the impacts of covid19 the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

risks related to our business operations 

the ability of suppliers to deliver raw materials parts and components to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture and deliver services without disruption could affect our results of operations 

we use a wide range of materials primarily steel copper and aluminum and components including semiconductors and other electronic components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers around the world because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns transportation delays work stoppages labor relations labor shortages global geopolitical instability price inflation governmental regulatory and enforcement actions intellectual property claims against suppliers financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters for example we expect to continue to be impacted by the following supply chain issues due to economic political and other factors largely beyond our control increased input material costs and component shortages supply chain disruptions and delays and cost inflation all of which could continue or escalate in the future in addition some of our subcontractors have also experienced supply chain and labor disruptions which have continued to impact our ability to timely complete projects and convert our backlog such disruptions have and could continue to interrupt our ability to manufacture or obtain certain products and components thereby adversely impacting our ability to provide products to customers convert our backlog into revenue and realize expected profit margins any significant disruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

material supply shortages and delays in deliveries along with other factors such as price inflation can also result in increased pricing while many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or if such repricing is not permitted during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract the inability to timely convert our backlog due 

to supply chain disruptions subjects us to pricing risk due to cost inflation occurring between the generation of backlog and its conversion into revenue if we are unable to effectively manage the impacts of price inflation and timely convert our backlog our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could materially and adversely be affected 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new products and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive and increasingly complex products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products services and technologies requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer we must also attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products particularly as we increase investment in our digital services and solutions business and our openblue software platform the laws and regulations applicable to our products and our customers’ product and service needs change from time to time and regulatory changes may render our products and technologies noncompliant we must also monitor disruptive technologies and business models in addition the markets for our products services and technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors the introduction of new competitors to the market with new or innovative product offerings or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cybersecurity incidents impacting our it systems and digital products could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems or integrate existing systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition we are relying on our it infrastructure to support our employees’ ability to work remotely if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system as a result of increased burdens placed on our it infrastructure or a security breach of our it systems the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its thirdparty service providers including cloud providers these threats and incidents originate from many sources globally and include malwares that take the form of computer viruses ransomware worms trojan horses spyware adware scareware rogue software and programs that act against the computer user while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date has been material to the company our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyberattacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems maintenance of backup and protective systems and the incorporation of cybersecurity design throughout the lifecycle of our products despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations such incidents could remain undetected for an extended period of time and the losses arising from such incidents could exceed our available insurance coverage for such matters 

an increasing number of our products services and technologies including our openblue software platform are delivered with digital capabilities and accompanying interconnected device networks which include sensors data building management systems and advanced computing and analytics capabilities if we are unable to manage the lifecycle cybersecurity risk in development deployment and operation of our digital platforms and services they could become susceptible to cybersecurity 

incidents and lead to thirdparty claims that our product failures have caused damages to our customers this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products and the role they play in managing building systems 

the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage adverse health safety and environmental consequences exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission or other governmental organizations diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

data privacy identity protection and information security compliance may require significant resources and presents certain risks 

we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data our business and our products may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors or errors that could potentially lead to compromising such data improper use of our products systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions a significant actual or perceived risk of theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of customer employee or other data whether by us our suppliers channel partners customers or other third parties as a result of employee error or malfeasance or as a result of the imaging software security and other products we incorporate into our products as well as noncompliance with applicable industry standards or our contractual or other legal obligations or privacy and information security policies regarding such data could result in costs fines litigation or regulatory actions or could lead customers to select the products and services of our competitors any such event could harm our reputation cause unfavorable publicity or otherwise adversely affect certain potential customers’ perception of the security and reliability of our services as well as our credibility and reputation which could result in lost sales in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure for example proposed regulations restricting the use of biometric security technology could impact the products and solutions offered by our security business government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

failure to increase organizational effectiveness through organizational improvements may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business 

our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are dependent upon our ability to drive organizational improvement we seek to drive improvements through a variety of actions including integration activities digital transformation business portfolio reviews productivity initiatives functionalization executive management changes and business and operating model assessments risks associated with these actions include delays in execution additional unexpected costs realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations in addition our failure to effectively manage organizational changes may lead to increased attrition and harm our ability to attract and retain key talent 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of trademarks trade secrets patents copyrights knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products from time to time we resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings can be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the 

product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business 

unlike many of our competitors we rely on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue the direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions and hvac equipment manufactured by us this represents a significant distribution channel for our products creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and hvac equipment and creates opportunities for longer term service and monitoring revenue if we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business whether due to changes in economic conditions a failure to anticipate changing customer needs a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions or for any other reason our installation revenue could decline which could in turn adversely impact our product pullthrough and our ability to grow service and monitoring revenue 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highperformance customercentric and diverse management team and workforce continuous efficient and timely customer service customer support and customer intimacy are essential to enabling customer loyalty and driving our financial results our growth strategies require that we pivot to new talent capability investments and build the workforce of the future with an emphasis on developing skills in digital and consultative outcomebased selling failure to ensure that we have the leadership and talent capacity with the necessary skillset and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

our ability to convert backlog into revenue requires us to maintain a labor force that is sufficiently large enough to support our manufacturing operations to meet customer demand as well as provide onsite services and project support for our customers this includes recruiting hiring and retaining skilled trade workers to support our direct channel field businesses recently we have experienced the impacts of shortages for both skilled and unskilled labor while we have taken measures to mitigate the impact of these shortages we can provide no assurance that such efforts will be successful the impacts of labor shortages could limit our ability to convert backlog into revenue and negatively impact our results of operations 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters climate change cybersecurity breaches power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises including covid19 related shutdowns labor disputes labor shortages or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders convert our backlog and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance for example during the covid19 pandemic we experienced disruptions in certain of our manufacturing facilities resulting from governmentmandated shutdowns and labor shortages the continuation or recurrence of either of these trends could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions to production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 102000 people worldwide approximately 22 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works councils other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available work stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

risks related to government regulations 

our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws codes and standards and similar foreign laws codes standards and regulations changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses competition or other regulatory investigations can continue for several years be costly to defend and can result in substantial fines if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls antitrust customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets and laws governing certain materials that may be in our products no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations 

existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials either directly or through our suppliers could have an impact on our competitive position business and financial results for example the us china and other countries continue to implement restrictive trade actions including tariffs export controls sanctions legislation favoring domestic investment and other actions impacting the import and export of goods foreign investment and foreign operations in jurisdictions in which we operate additional measures imposed by such countries on a broader range of imports or economic activity or retaliatory trade measures taken by other countries in response could increase the cost of our products create disruptions to our supply chain and impair our ability to effectively operate and compete in such countries 

we are also subject to a complex network of tax laws and tax treaties that impact our effective tax rate for more information on risks related to tax regulation see “risks related to tax matters” below 

we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

the effects of climate change create financial risks to our business for example the effects of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing exacerbate existing risks to our supply chain and increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks we could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these regulations tend to be implemented under global national and subnational climate objectives or policies and target the global warming potential “gwp” of refrigerants equipment energy efficiency and the combustion of fossil fuels as a heating source many of our products consume energy and use refrigerants regulations which seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions present a risk to our global products business predominantly our hvac business if we do not adequately prepare our product portfolio as a result we may be required to make increased research and development and other capital expenditures to improve our product portfolio in order to meet new regulations and standards further our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation marketbased emissions policies or consumer preference that we may not be able to timely meet due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement while we have been committed to continuous improvements to our product portfolio to meet and exceed anticipated regulations and preferences there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development 

we are subject to emerging and competing climate regulations there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives which if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance these factors may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

as of the date of this filing we have made several public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions including commitments to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and the establishment of sciencebased targets to reduce carbon emissions from our operations and the operations of our customers although we intend to meet these commitments we may be required to expend significant resources to do so which could increase our operational costs further there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or nonbinding legal standards regarding sustainability performance moreover we may determine that it is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders to prioritize other business social governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic regulatory and social factors business strategy or pressure from investors activist groups or other stakeholders if we are unable to meet these commitments then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors activist groups and other stakeholders which could adversely impact the perception of our brand and our products and services by current and potential customers as well as investors which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations 

we are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters which could adversely affect our business results of operation and reputation 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other things solid and hazardous waste storage treatment and disposal and remediation of releases of hazardous materials there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials for example proposed federal state and european union legislative action concerning the use and cleanup of firefighting foam products including the united states environmental protection agency’s proposal to designate perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa as hazardous substances under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act could negatively impact our firefighting business and our results of operations thereby enhancing the risks to our business described under “potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs” below 

federal state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters including but not limited to health safety laws governing employee injuries and permitting requirements in addition to the environmental matters discussed above if we are unable to adequately comply with applicable health and safety regulations and provide our employees with a safe working environment we may be subject to litigation and regulatory action in addition to negatively impacting our ability to attract and retain talented employees new legislation and regulations may require us to make material changes to our operations resulting in significant increases to the cost of production additionally violations of environmental health and safety laws are subject to civil and in some cases criminal sanctions as a result of these various uncertainties we may incur unexpected interruptions to operations fines penalties or other reductions in income which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws around the world 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with antibribery laws we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will preclude reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations we will investigate the allegations and may engage outside counsel to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we could be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of such compliance matters which also could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the us government 

our customers include many us federal state and local government authorities doing business with the us federal state and local governments subjects us to certain particular risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for failure to perform under the applicable contract we are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition various us federal and state legislative proposals have been made in the past that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

risks related to litigation 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

we have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing and testing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties including our fire technology center and stanton street manufacturing facility located in marinette wisconsin these projects relate to a variety of activities including arsenic solvent oil metal lead pfos pfoa andor other per and polyfluorinated substances pfas and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable future expenses that we may incur to remediate identified sites and resolve outstanding litigation could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we have been named along with others in a number of class action and other lawsuits relating to the use of firefighting foam products by the us department of defense the us military and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises it is difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure if any represented by these matters and there can be no assurance that any such exposure will not be material such claims may also negatively affect our reputation see note 21 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based 

primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits on satisfactory terms in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows see note 21 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims in addition we may be exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure in our fire and security businesses than may not be inherent in other businesses in particular because many of our fire and security products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than other businesses the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to strategic transactions 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or joint ventures 

we expect acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as joint ventures or other strategic arrangements to play a role in our future growth and our ability to build capabilities in our products and services we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses acquisitions and investments may be dilutive to earnings acquisitions involve numerous other risks including the diversion of management attention to integration matters difficulties in integrating operations and systems challenges in conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and compensation structures difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel challenges in successfully integrating and operating businesses with different characteristics than our current core businesses challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects contingent liabilities including contingent tax liabilities and earnout obligations that are larger than expected and potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquired companies 

  

the goodwill and intangible assets recorded with past acquisitions were significant and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations competition for acquisition opportunities may rise thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions 

many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future our joint venture partners may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture in addition we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships our joint venture arrangements may require us among other matters to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner’s consent to take certain actions in addition our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business some divestitures may be dilutive to earnings in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the event we are unable to successfully divest a business or product line we may be forced to wind down such business or product line which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may also result in a diversion of management attention operational difficulties and losses 

risks related to tax matters 

future potential changes to the tax laws could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals and such changes could have a prospective or retroactive application however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting johnson controls international plc’s ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could be subject to increased taxation potentially significant expense andor other adverse tax consequences 

the us enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 “ira” in august 2022 which among other sections creates a new book minimum tax of at least 15 of consolidated gaap pretax income for corporations with average book income in excess of 1 billion the book minimum tax will first apply to us in fiscal 2024 we do not expect the ira to have a material impact on our effective tax rate however it is possible that the us congress could advance other tax legislation proposals in the future that could have a material impact on our tax rate in addition in october 2021 136 out of 140 countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting if including ireland politically committed to potentially fundamental changes to the international corporate tax system including the potential implementation of a global minimum corporate tax rate while the details of these pronouncements remain unclear and timing of implementation uncertain the impact of local country if adoption could have a material impact on our effective tax rate it is also possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to such if developments unilaterally by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect us or our affiliates there is also general uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate and if changes are enacted there could be a resulting increase in our effective tax rate 

the internal revenue service irs may not agree that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under current us federal tax law a corporation is generally considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation because johnson controls international plc is an irish incorporated entity it would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules however section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under section 7874 if 1 former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 80 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding johnson controls inc common stock such ownership percentage the section 7874 ownership percentage and 2 our expanded affiliated group did not have substantial business activities in ireland the substantial business activities test we will be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes if the section 7874 ownership percentage of the former johnson controls inc shareholders after the merger was less than 80 but at least 60 and the substantial business activities test was not met we and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco may in some circumstances be subject to certain adverse us federal 

income tax rules which among other things could limit their ability to utilize certain us tax attributes to offset us taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions the application of these rules could result in significant additional us tax liability and limit our ability to restructure or access cash earned by certain of our nonus subsidiaries in each case without incurring substantial us tax liabilities 

based on the terms of the merger the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 and certain factual assumptions we believe that former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 less than 60 by both vote and value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding shares of johnson controls inc common stock therefore under current law we believe that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 should otherwise not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the merger 

however the determination of the section 7874 ownership percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties thus there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger 

regardless of any application of section 7874 we are treated as an irish tax resident for irish tax purposes consequently if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and irish taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes to the us model income tax treaty could adversely affect us 

on february 17 2016 the us treasury released a revised us model income tax convention the new model which is the baseline text used by the us treasury to negotiate tax treaties if any or all of the modifications to the model treaty are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and substantially increase our worldwide tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific modifications to the model treaty and we cannot provide assurance that any such modifications will not apply to us 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the reversal of outside basis differences that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally changes in tax laws in the us ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company johnson controls is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of johnson controls international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares there is no irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty is payable for certain share transfers a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to johnson controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases johnson controls may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty johnson controls memorandum and articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment johnson controls i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii may have a lien against the johnson controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in johnson controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by johnson controls 

dividends paid by us may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we will be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 25 from dividends paid to our shareholders shareholders that are residents in the us european union countries other than ireland or other countries with which ireland has signed a tax treaty whether the treaty has been ratified or not generally should not be subject to irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of johnson controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

johnson controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

general risk factors 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

risks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets discount rates mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods because we marktomarket our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis large non 

cash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when a remeasurement event occurs generally accepted accounting principles in the us require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon among other factors interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds in the market or under our existing credit agreements if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted and the price we pay to issue debt could increase historically we have relied on our ability to issue commercial paper rather than to draw on our credit facility to support our daily operations which means that a downgrade in our ratings or volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 

further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our business loss of changes in or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers cancellation of or significant delays in projects in our backlog delays or difficulties in new product development our ability to recognize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems and natural or manmade disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers

macroeconomic trends 

much of the demand for installation of the company’s products and solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit positive or negative fluctuations in commercial and residential construction industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects and other capital investments in buildings could have a corresponding impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as a result of the company’s global presence a significant portion of its revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the company is therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while the company employs financial instruments to hedge some of its transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate it completely from those exposures in addition the currency exposure from the translation of nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries are not able to be hedged exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could increase or reduce the company’s profit margin respectively and impact the comparability of results from period to period during fiscal 2022 revenue and profits were adversely impacted due to the significant strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies the continued strength of the us dollar could continue to adversely impact the companys results 

the company continues to observe trends demonstrating increased interest and demand for its products and services that enable smart safe efficient and sustainable buildings this demand is driven in part by government tax incentives building performance standards and other regulations designed to limit emissions and combat climate change in particular legislative and regulatory initiatives such as the us climate smart buildings imitative us inflection reduction act and eu energy performance of buildings directive include provisions designed to fund and encourage investment in decarbonization and digital technologies for buildings this demand is supplemented by an increase in commitments in both the public and private sectors to reduce emissions andor achieve net zero emissions the company seeks to capitalize on these trends to drive growth by developing and delivering technologies and solutions to create smart sustainable and healthy buildings the company is investing in new digital and product capabilities including its openblue platform to enable it to deliver sustainable highefficiency products and tailored services to enable customers to achieve their sustainability goals the company is leveraging its install base together with datadriven products and services to offer outcomebased solutions to customers with a focus on generating accelerated growth in services and recurring revenue 

the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience increased input material cost inflation and component shortages as well as disruptions and delays in its supply chain as a result of global macroeconomic trends including increased global demand the conflict between russia and ukraine governmentmandated actions in response to covid19 particularly in china and labor shortages actions taken by the company to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation including expanding and redistributing its supplier network supplier financing price increases and productivity improvements have generally been successful in offsetting some but not all of the impact of these trends the collective impact of these trends has been to positively impact revenue due to increased demand and price increases to offset inflation while negatively impacting margins due to supply chain disruptions and cost pressures the company has also experienced delays in converting its backlog due to continued supply chain disruptions negatively impacting both revenues and margins although the company has experienced recent improvement in its supply chain the company expects that these trends will continue to impact its results into fiscal 2023 therefore the company could experience further disruptions shortages and cost increases in the future the effect of which will depend on the company’s ability to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these events 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 the company suspended its operations in russia in response to the conflict between russia and ukraine although this decision has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s 

operating results the broader consequences of this conflict including heightened supply chain disruption inflation economic instability and other factors have and could continue to adversely impact the company’s results of operations 

impact of covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact aspects of the companys operations and results during fiscal 2022 the companys facilities generally operated at normal levels however the company has experienced some disruptions to its business in china due to governmentmandated lockdowns in several major cities 

the company has experienced increases in demand as governments have distributed vaccines and lifted covid19related restrictions leading to increases in retrofit activity and commercial building construction as a result of the pandemic the company has seen an increase in demand for its products and solutions that promote building health and optimize customers’ infrastructure 

however the company continues to be influenced by covid19related trends impacting site access and the labor force which have and may continue to negatively impact the company’s revenues and margins challenges in reaching sufficient vaccination levels and the introduction of new variants of covid19 have caused some governments to extend or reinstitute lockdowns and similar restrictive measures which in some cases have limited the company’s ability to access customer sites to install and maintain its products and deliver services in addition the company has experienced and continues to experience labor shortages at certain facilities as the company expands its production capacity to meet increased customer demand although the company is mitigating these shortages through focused recruitment efforts and competitive compensation packages the company could continue to experience such shortages in the future 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for an additional discussion of risks related to covid19 

restructuring and cost optimization initiatives 

to better align its resources with its growth strategies and reduce the cost structure of its global operations in certain underlying markets the company commits to restructuring plans as necessary in fiscal 2021 the company announced its plans to optimize its cost structure through broadbased sga actions focused on simplification standardization and centralization with the intent to deliver annualized savings of 300 million by fiscal 2023 the “2021 plan” additionally the company announced cost of sales actions to drive 250 million in annual run rate savings by fiscal 2023 the company believes it is on track to deliver and exceed the productivity savings by fiscal 2023 for more information on the company’s restructuring plans see “liquidity and capital resources—restructuring” 

fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 

net sales 



the increase in net sales was due to higher organic sales 2033 million incremental sales from acquisitions 356 million and the impact of prior year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments 6 million partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 741 million and lower sales due to business divestitures 23 million excluding the impact of foreign currency translation business acquisitions and divestitures and nonrecurring adjustments consolidated net sales increased 9 as compared to the prior year attributable to higher volumes and increased pricing in response to inflation pressures refer to the segment analysis below within item 7 for a discussion of net sales by segment 

cost of sales  gross profit 



cost of sales and gross profit both increased and gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 110 basis points gross profit increased due to organic sales growth and business acquisitions partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 229 million supply chain inefficiencies pricecost pressures and the unfavorable yearoveryear impact of net pension marktomarket adjustments 121 million gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased as the benefit of volume leverage was more than offset by supply chain inefficiencies and pricecost pressures refer to the segment analysis below within item 7 for a discussion of segment earnings before interest taxes and amortization ebita 

selling general and administrative expenses 



selling general and administrative expenses sga increased by 687 million and sga as a percentage of sales increased by 130 basis points the increase in sga on a percentage basis was primarily due to the current year environmental remediation charge and related reserves 255 million the unfavorable yearoveryear impact of net marktomarket adjustments on pension plans 154 million the unfavorable yearoveryear impact of net marktomarket adjustments on restricted asbestos investments 93 million the absence of certain onetime cost mitigation actions and current year business acquisitions partially offset by a favorable earnout liability adjustment 43 million and favorable foreign currency translation 141 million refer to the segment analysis below within item 7 for a discussion of segment ebita

income tax provision 



 measure not meaningful 

the statutory tax rate in ireland of 125 is being used as a comparison since the company is domiciled in ireland

critical accounting estimates 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures actual results could differ from those estimates the following estimates are considered by management to be the most critical to the understanding of the companys consolidated financial statements as they require significant judgments that could materially impact the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue from certain longterm contracts on an over time basis with progress towards completion measured using a costtocost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion total estimated costs at completion are based primarily on estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections factors that may result in a change to these estimates include unforeseen engineering problems construction delays cost inflation the performance of subcontractors and major material suppliers and weather conditions as a result changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract such estimates are reviewed monthly and any adjustments to the measure of completion are recognized as adjustments to sales and gross profit using the cumulative catchup method estimated losses are recorded when identified 

for agreements with multiple performance obligations the company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract in order to estimate relative selling price market data and transfer price studies are utilized if the standalone selling price is not directly observable the company estimates the standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach or expected cost plus margin approach 

the company considers the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price including discounts rebates refunds credits or other similar sources of variable consideration when determining the transaction price of each contract the company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved these estimates are based on the amount of consideration that the company expects to be entitled to 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of july 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units which have been determined to be the company’s reportable segments or one level below the reportable segments in certain instances using a fair value method based on management’s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in estimating the fair value the company uses the multiples of earnings approach based on the average of published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics that are applied to the companys average of historical and future financial results in certain instances the company uses discounted cash flow analyses or estimated sales price to further support the fair value estimates the assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations the key assumptions used in the impairment tests were managements projections of future cash flows weightedaverage cost of capital and longterm growth rates although the companys cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unit 

during its fiscal 2022 annual impairment test the company determined that its silentaire reporting units goodwill was impaired by 75 million no other reporting unit was determined to be at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test 

indefinitelived intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names and are tested for impairment using a relieffromroyalty method a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests the key assumptions used in the impairment tests were longterm revenue growth projections weightedaverage cost of capital the royalty rate and general industry market and macroeconomic conditions 

the company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value while the company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible impairment tests are reasonable different assumptions or changes in general industry market and macroeconomic conditions could change the estimated fair values and therefore future impairment charges could be required which could be material to the consolidated financial statements 

refer to note 8 goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the results of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing performed in fiscal 2022 and 2021 

pension plans 

the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions plan assets and obligations are measured annually or more frequently if there is a significant remeasurement event based on the company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return and compensation increases as of that date the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

the company utilizes a marktomarket approach for recognizing pension expenses including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event refer to note 16 retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the companys pension plans 

us gaap requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for plans that are underfunded or unfunded or an asset for plans that are over funded us gaap also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan’s funded status as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year end 

the company considers the expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis when setting assumed discount rates as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for the us pension plans the company uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds for the nonus pension plans the company consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates the company’s weighted average discount rate on us pension plans was 508 and 250 at september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively the company’s weighted average discount rate on nonus pension plans was 436 and 180 at september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets the company considers the historical returns on plan assets adjusted for forwardlooking considerations inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans’ invested assets reflecting the relatively longterm nature of the plans’ obligations approximately 19 of the plans’ assets are invested in equity securities and 66 in fixed income securities with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments for the years ended september 30 2022 and 2021 the company’s expected longterm return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 700 and 650 respectively the actual rate of return on us pension plans was below 700 in fiscal 2022 and above 650 in fiscal 2021 for the years ended september 30 2022 and 2021 the company’s weighted average expected longterm return on nonus pension plan assets was 370 and 490 respectively the actual rate of return on nonus pension plans was below 370 in fiscal 2022 and above 490 in fiscal 2021 

beginning in fiscal 2023 the company believes the longterm rate of return will approximate 825 for us pension plans and 370 for nonus pension plans any differences between actual investment results and the expected longterm asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a significant remeasurement event if the company’s actual returns on plan assets are less than the company’s expectations additional contributions may be required 

in fiscal 2022 total employer contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were 93 million none of which were voluntary contributions made by the company the company expects to contribute approximately 38 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2023 

based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

marktomarket adjustments represent actuarial gains losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experiences different from those assumed that are used to value the plan assets and the benefit obligations the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains losses are changes in the discount rate used to value benefit obligations and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets marktomarket adjustments are highly volatile and are difficult to forecast refer to note 16 retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 

the following chart illustrates the estimated increases decreases in projected benefit obligation and future ongoing pension expense which excludes any potential marktomarket adjustments assuming an increase of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for the companys pension plans in millions

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental matters selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

the company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment it is difficult to estimate the company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur it is possible that technological regulatory or enforcement developments the results of additional environmental studies or other factors could change the companys expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays and such changes could be material to the companys future results of operations financial condition or cash flows nevertheless the company does not currently believe that any claims penalties or costs in addition to the amounts accrued will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated during fiscal 2022 the company increased its accrual for environmental remediation liabilities by 228 million refer to note 21 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable the company maintains captive insurance companies to manage its insurable liabilities 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials the companys estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present value from 2068 which is the companys reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestosrelated claims will be filed against company affiliates estimated asbestosrelated defense costs are included in the asbestos liability the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2068 annually the company assesses the 

sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters the company records asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the companys estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims discounted to present value in determining the amount of insurance recoverable the company considers available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers refer to note 21 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents nonus operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets 

the company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered along with any other positive or negative evidence since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowances may be necessary at september 30 2022 the company had a valuation allowance of 60 billion for continuing operations of which 55 billion relates to net operating loss carryforwards primarily in france germany ireland luxembourg mexico spain united kingdom and the us for which sustainable taxable income has not been demonstrated and 05 billion for other deferred tax assets

risk management 

the company selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency commodities stockbased compensation and interest rates all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes at the inception of the hedge the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either 1 a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of a recognized firm commitment a fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a nonus operation a net investment hedge the company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used all other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging are revalued in the consolidated statements of income 

for all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test the fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated the hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 for commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges effectiveness is tested using a regression calculation ineffectiveness is minimal as the company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts 

for net investment hedges the company assesses its net investment positions in the nonus operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis the hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a nonus operation does not exceed the company’s net investment positions in the respective nonus operation 

equity swaps and any other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 require no assessment of effectiveness 

a discussion of the company’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 11 derivative instruments and hedging activities and note 12 fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange 

the company has manufacturing sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies in order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the company’s global diversification foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are as appropriate hedged with financial instruments 

the company hedges 70 to 90 of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures the company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items the company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 

the company has entered into foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income aoci account within shareholders’ equity attributable to johnson controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the company’s net investm ents globally 

at september 30 2022 and 2021 the company estimates that an unfavorable 10 change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately 133 million and 213 million respectively 

interest rates 

substantially all of the companys outstanding debt has fixed interest rates and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations a 20 basis point increasedecrease in the average interest rate on the companys variable rate debt would have an immaterial impact on interest expense 

commodities 

the company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines as a cash flow hedge gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business the maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities 

environmental health and safety and other matters 

the company’s global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws under various circumstances these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material

at september 30 2021 remaining performance obligations were  161 billion which is 56 billion higher than the companys backlog of 105 billion differences between the company’s remaining performance obligations and backlog are primarily due to the following 

• remaining performance obligations include large multipurpose contracts to construct hospitals schools and other governmental buildings which are services to be performed over the buildings lifetime with average initial contract terms of 25 to 35 years for the entire term of the contract versus backlog which includes only the lifecycle period of these contracts which approximates five years 

• the company has elected to exclude from remaining performance obligations certain contracts with customers with a term of one year or less or contracts that are cancelable without substantial penalty while these contracts are included within backlog and 

• remaining performance obligations include the full remaining term of service contracts with substantial termination penalties versus backlog which includes one year for all outstanding service contracts

 item 1a   risk factors 

provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” the disclosure of a risk should not be interpreted imply that such risk has not already materialized additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to economic and political conditions 

impacts related to the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global outbreak of covid19 has disrupted economic activity around the world as a result we and our affiliates employees suppliers customers and others have been and may continue to be restricted or prevented from conducting normal business activities including as a result of shutdowns travel restrictions and other actions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities while a substantial portion of our businesses and facilities have been classified as essential in 

jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated we can give no assurance that there will not be additional closures in the future or that our businesses and facilities will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the covid19 outbreak has impacted and may continue to impact our office locations manufacturing and servicing facilities and distribution centers as well as those of our thirdparty vendors including the effects of facility closures reductions in operating hours and other social distancing efforts in response to the challenges presented by covid19 we modified our business practices including restricting nonessential employee travel implementing remote work protocols and limiting physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers these modifications to our business practices including any future actions we take may cause us to experience increases in costs reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines 

in september 2021 the biden administration issued an executive order requiring usbased employees contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of us government contracts to be fully vaccinated by january 4 2022 the executive order includes onsite and remote usbased employees contractors and subcontractors and it only permits limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons the occupational safety and health administration osha has also issued rules requiring that all large employers in the us have employee populations that are fully vaccinated against or regularly tested for covid19 at least once per week by january 4 2022 however the implementation of the osha rules has been blocked by a federal appeals court subject to the resolution of ongoing litigation challenging the constitutionality of the rules these actions are or are expected to be applicable to our us operations and our federal contracting business and we have announced an internal vaccine mandate with respect to our usbased employees who fall within the scope of the federal contractor and subcontractor executive order it is also possible that additional vaccine mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which our businesses operate in addition certain customers have issued vaccine requirements with respect to our employees who provide onsite service at customer facilities our efforts to comply with these mandates including requiring that some or all of our employees be fully vaccinated against covid19 could result in increased labor attrition and disruption as well as difficulty securing future labor needs and could adversely impact our ability to deliver services to our us federal government customers and potentially other customers which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations 

we may also experience impacts from market forces and changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears as a result of covid19 although we experienced increases in both demand and volumes during fiscal 2021 as governments distributed vaccines and lifted covid19related restrictions challenges in achieving sufficient vaccination levels and the introduction of new variants of covid19 have and could continue to negatively impact our results of operations due to the extension or reinstitution of lockdowns and similar restrictive measures limited access to customer sites to perform installation and service work the delay or abandonment of projects on which we provide products andor services and the general adverse impacts on demand and sales volumes from industries that are sensitive to economic downturns and volatility in commodity prices in addition the company has experienced and could continue to experience labor shortages at its facilities as the company expands its production capacity to meet increased customer demand further the covid19 pandemic could result in permanent changes in the behaviors of our customers including the increased prevalence of remote work and a corresponding decline in demand for the construction and maintenance of commercial buildings any of these impacts could cause our stock price and the operating performances of our businesses to be adversely affected which could require us to incur material impairment restructuring or other charges 

our management of the impact of covid19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees as well as resources across our global enterprise this may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments which may adversely impact our future results of operations in addition issues relating to the covid19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the resurgence of covid19 and its variants in regions recovering from the impacts of the pandemic the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and the speed at which populations are vaccinated around the globe the impact of covid19 on economic activity and regulatory actions taken to contain the impact of covid19 on public health and the global economy the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the ability of suppliers to deliver raw materials parts and components to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our results of operations 

we use a wide range of materials primarily steel copper and aluminum and components including semiconductors and other electronic components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers around the world because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including covid19related supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns transportation delays work stoppages labor relations labor shortages price inflation governmental regulatory and enforcement actions intellectual property claims against suppliers financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters for example we expect to continue to be impacted by the following supply chain issues due to economic political and other factors largely beyond our control increased input material costs and component shortages supply chain disruptions and delays and cost inflation all of which could continue or escalate in the future the effects of climate change including extreme weather events longterm changes in temperature levels water availability increased cost for decarbonizing process heating supply costs impacted by increasing energy costs or energy costs impacted by carbon prices or offsets may exacerbate these risks such disruptions could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

material supply shortages and delays in deliveries along with other factors such as price inflation can also result in increased pricing while many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or if such repricing is not permitted during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 

increases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed therefore in the shortterm our ability to adjust for changes in certain commodity prices is limited in these cases if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply based fixedprice contracts we use commodity hedge contracts to minimize overall price risk associated with our anticipated commodity purchases unfavorability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level additionally to the extent we do not or are unable to hedge certain commodities and the commodity prices substantially increase such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased commodity costs as a result of global macroeconomic trends while we have taken action to offset increasing commodity costs as described above we have nonetheless experienced negative impacts on profitability as a result of such increased costs continued increased commodity costs could continue to negatively impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these costs 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

much of the demand for installation of hvac security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit commercial and residential real estate markets are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values could lead to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors could in turn temper demand for new hvac fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance are dependent on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity and component prices as well as commodity and component shortages can negatively 

affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries tend to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy component and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could significantly raise the cost of new debt for our customers any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers inside and outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse or stagnant economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with our nonus operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the us some of which are located in emerging markets longterm economic uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which we operate such as asia south america the middle east europe and emerging markets could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements 

in addition as a result of our global presence a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period 

there are other risks that are inherent in our nonus operations including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions laws and regulations including antitrust import export labor and environmental laws and monetary and fiscal policies protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures or impact trade volumes unsettled or unstable political conditions governmentimposed plant or other operational shutdowns backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions corruption natural and manmade disasters hazards and losses violence civil and labor unrest and possible terrorist attacks 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks related to government regulations 

our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws codes and standards and similar foreign laws codes standards and regulations changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses competition or other regulatory investigations can continue for several years be costly to defend and can result in 

substantial fines if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls antitrust customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets and laws governing certain materials that may be in our products no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations for example existing free trade laws and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement or any successor agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials either directly or through our suppliers could have an impact on our competitive position business and financial results for example certain of our businesses have a significant presence in the united kingdom the “uk” where the success of the brexit referendum in 2016 has continued to cause political and economic uncertainty in december 2020 the uk and the european union announced they had entered into a postbrexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues depending on the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement between the uk and the european union we could face increased regulatory costs and challenges the implications of these uncertainties could affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we are also subject to a complex network of tax laws and tax treaties that impact our effective tax rate for more information on risks related to tax regulation see “risks related to tax matters” below 

we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

the effects of climate change such as extreme weather conditions and water scarcity create financial risks to our business for example the demand for our products and services such as commercial and residential air conditioning equipment may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions the effects of climate change could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks we could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

there is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to global climate change and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert the worst effects of climate change increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change will result in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these regulations tend to be implemented under global national and subnational climate objectives or policies and target the global warming potential “gwp” of refrigerants equipment energy efficiency and the combustion of fossil fuels as a heating source many of our products consume energy and use refrigerants regulations which seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions present a risk to our global products business predominantly our hvac business if we do not adequately prepare our product portfolio as a result we may be required to make increased capital expenditures to improve our product portfolio to meet new regulations and standards further our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation marketbased emissions policies or consumer preference that we may not be able to timely meet due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement while we have been committed to continuous improvements to our product portfolio to meet and exceed anticipated regulations and preferences there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development 

there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives which if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance these factors may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

as of the date of this filing we have made several public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions including commitments to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and the establishment of sciencebased targets to reduce carbon emissions from our operations and the operations of our customers although we intend to meet these commitments we 

may be required to expend significant resources to do so which could increase our operational costs further there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or nonbinding legal standards regarding sustainability performance moreover we may determine that it is in the best interest of our company and our stockholders to prioritize other business social governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic regulatory and social factors business strategy or pressure from investors activist groups or other stakeholders if we are unable to meet these commitments then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors activist groups our other stakeholders which could adversely impact the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers as well as investors which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations 

we are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters which could adversely affect our business results of operation and reputation 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other things solid and hazardous waste storage treatment and disposal and remediation of releases of hazardous materials there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials for example proposed federal state and european union legislative action concerning the use and cleanup of firefighting foam products could negatively impact our firefighting business and our results of operations thereby enhancing the risks to our business described under “potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs” below 

federal state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters including but not limited to health safety laws governing employee injuries and permitting requirements in addition to the environmental matters discussed above if we are unable to adequately comply with applicable health and safety regulations and provide our employees with a safe working environment we may be subject to litigation and regulatory action in addition to negatively impacting our ability to attract and retain talented employees new legislation and regulations may require the company to make material changes to its operations resulting in significant increases to the cost of production 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws around the world 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with antibribery laws we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we could be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of such compliance matters or we could be subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the us government 

our customers include many us federal state and local government authorities doing business with the us government and state and local authorities subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for failure to perform under the applicable contract we are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended from bidding on or 

receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations in addition various us federal and state legislative proposals have been made in the past that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

risks related to our business operations 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new products and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive and increasingly complex products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products services and technologies requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer we must also attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products particularly as we increase investment in our digital services and solutions businesses and our openblue platform the laws and regulations applicable to our products and our customers’ product and service needs change from time to time and regulatory changes may render our products and technologies noncompliant we must also monitor disruptive technologies and business models in addition the markets for our products services and technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors the introduction of new competitors to the market with new or innovative product offerings or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks 

an increasing number of our products services and technologies including our openblue platform are delivered with digital capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks which include sensors data building management systems and advanced computing capabilities if we are unable to manage the lifecycle cybersecurity risk in development deployment and operation of our digital platforms and services the possible consequences include financial loss reputational damage adverse health safety and environmental consequences exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission or other governmental organizations the diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems or integrate existing systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition we are relying on our it infrastructure to support our operations as we manage the impact of covid19 including through initiating remotework protocols for a substantial number of our employees in regions impacted by the spread of the virus if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system as a result of the increased burden placed on our it infrastructure or a security breach of our it systems including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its thirdparty service providers including cloud providers these threats and incidents originate from many sources globally and include malwares that take the form of computer viruses ransomware worms trojan horses spyware adware scareware rogue software and programs that act against the computer user while we have experienced and expect to 

continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date has been material to the company our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyberattacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems maintenance of backup and protective systems and the incorporation of cybersecurity design throughout the lifecycle of our products despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations such incidents could remain undetected for an extended period of time and the losses arising from such incidents could exceed our available insurance coverage for such matters cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to thirdparty claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products and the role they play in managing building systems the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage adverse health safety and environmental consequences exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission or other governmental organizations diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

data privacy identity protection and information security compliance may require significant resources and presents certain risks 

we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data our business and our products may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors or errors that could potentially lead to compromising such data improper use of our products systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions a significant actual or perceived risk of theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of customer employee or other data whether by us our suppliers channel partners customers or other third parties as a result of employee error or malfeasance or as a result of the imaging software security and other products we incorporate into our products as well as noncompliance with applicable industry standards or our contractual or other legal obligations or privacy and informationsecurity policies regarding such data could result in costs fines litigation or regulatory actions or could lead customers to select products and services of our competitors in addition any such event could harm our reputation cause unfavorable publicity or otherwise adversely affect certain potential customers’ perception of the security and reliability of our services as well as our credibility and reputation which could result in lost sales in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure for example proposed regulations restricting the use of biometric security technology could impact the products and solutions offered by our security business government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of trademarks trade secrets patents copyrights knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products we from time to time resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings can be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than 

those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business 

unlike many of our competitors we rely on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue the direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions and hvac equipment manufactured by us this represents a significant distribution channel for our products creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and hvac equipment and creates opportunities for longer term service and monitoring revenue if we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business whether due to changes in economic conditions a failure to anticipate changing customer needs a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions or for any other reason our installation revenue could decline which could in turn adversely impact our product pullthrough and our ability to grow service and monitoring revenue 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highperformance customercentric and diverse management team and workforce continuous efficient and timely customer service customer support and customer intimacy are essential to enabling customer loyalty and driving our financial results our growth strategies require that we pivot to new talent capability investments and build the workforce of the future with an emphasis on developing skills in digital and consultative outcomebased selling failure to ensure that we have the leadership and talent capacity with the necessary skillset and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership organizational and reporting changes resulting from any future leadership transition or corporate initiatives could result in increased turnover additionally any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

our ability to convert backlog into revenue requires us to maintain a labor force that is sufficiently large enough to support our manufacturing operations to meet customer demand as well as provide onsite services and project support for our customers this includes recruiting hiring and retaining skilled trade workers to support our direct channel field businesses recently we have experienced the impacts of widespread shortages for both skilled and unskilled labor while we have taken measures to mitigate the impact of these shortages and enhanced our ability to recruit and retain skilled and unskilled labor we can provide no assurance that such efforts will be successful if the impacts of labor shortages continue and our mitigation efforts are unsuccessful this could limit our ability to convert backlog into revenue and negatively impact our results of operations 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters climate change power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises including covid19 related shutdowns labor disputes labor shortages or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance for example during the covid19 pandemic we experienced disruptions in certain of our manufacturing facilities resulting from governmentmandated shutdowns during the onset of the pandemic and have more recently experienced labor shortages as we have sought to expand production capacity in response to increased demand the continuation or recurrence of either of these trends could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our 

insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 101000 people worldwide approximately 22 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works councils other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure in our fire and security businesses than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because many of our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we do not own the right to use the adt® brand name in the us and canada 

we own the adt® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the us and canada and the adt corporation adt owns the brand name in the us and canada although we have entered into agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt® brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the us and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the us and canada any of these factors may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to litigation 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

we have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing and testing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties including our fire technology center and stanton street manufacturing facility located in marinette wisconsin these projects relate to a variety of activities including arsenic solvent oil metal lead perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa andor other per and polyfluorinated substances pfas and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable future expenses that we may incur to remediate identified sites and resolve outstanding litigation could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we have been named along with others in a number of class action and other lawsuits relating to the use of firefighting foam products by the us department of defense the us military and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises it is difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure if any represented by these matters and there can be no assurance that any such exposure will not be material such claims may also negatively affect our reputation see note 23 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows see note 23 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

risks relating to strategic transactions 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or joint ventures 

we expect acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as joint ventures or other strategic arrangements to play a role in our future growth we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including the diversion of management attention to integration matters difficulties in integrating operations and systems challenges in conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and compensation structures difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects contingent liabilities including contingent tax liabilities and earnout obligations that are larger than expected and potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquired companies 

  

the goodwill and intangible assets recorded with past acquisitions were significant and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions 

many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future our joint venture partners may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture in addition we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships our joint venture arrangements may require us among other matters to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner’s consent to take certain actions in addition our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business some divestitures may be dilutive to earnings in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to 

goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may also result in a diversion of management attention operational difficulties and losses 

risks related to tax matters 

future potential changes to the tax laws could adversely affect us and our affiliates 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals and such changes could have a prospective or retroactive application however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding the incorporation in ireland or limiting johnson controls international plc’s ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could be subject to increased taxation potentially significant expense andor other adverse tax consequences 

recently the us congress has advanced a variety of tax legislation proposals that are under consideration for potential legislative action while the final form of any legislative action is still unknown various proposals if enacted could have a material impact on the company’s effective tax rate in october 2021 136 out of 140 countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting if including ireland politically committed to potentially fundamental changes to the international corporate tax system including the potential implementation of a global minimum corporate tax rate while the details of these pronouncements presently remain unclear and timing of implementation uncertain the impact of local country if adoption could have a material impact on our effective tax rate it is also possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to such if developments unilaterally by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect us or our affiliates there is also general uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate and if changes are enacted there could be a resulting increase in our effective tax rate 

the internal revenue service irs may not agree that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under current us federal tax law a corporation is generally considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation because johnson controls international plc is an irish incorporated entity it would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules however section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under section 7874 if 1 former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 80 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding johnson controls inc common stock such ownership percentage the section 7874 ownership percentage and 2 our expanded affiliated group did not have substantial business activities in ireland the substantial business activities test we will be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes if the section 7874 ownership percentage of the former johnson controls inc shareholders after the merger was less than 80 but at least 60 and the substantial business activities test was not met we and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco may in some circumstances be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules which among other things could limit their ability to utilize certain us tax attributes to offset us taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions the application of these rules could result in significant additional us tax liability and limit our ability to restructure or access cash earned by certain of our nonus subsidiaries in each case without incurring substantial us tax liabilities 

based on the terms of the merger the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 and certain factual assumptions we believe that former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 less than 60 by both vote and value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding shares of johnson controls inc common stock therefore under current law we believe that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 should otherwise not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the merger 

however the determination of the section 7874 ownership percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties thus there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger 

regardless of any application of section 7874 we are treated as an irish tax resident for irish tax purposes consequently if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and irish taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes to the us model income tax treaty could adversely affect us 

on february 17 2016 the us treasury released a revised us model income tax convention the new model which is the baseline text used by the us treasury to negotiate tax treaties if any or all of the modifications to the model treaty are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and substantially increase our worldwide tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific modifications to the model treaty and we cannot provide assurance that any such modifications will not apply to us 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the reversal of outside basis differences that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally changes in tax laws in the us ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

a judgment obtained against us will be enforced by the courts of ireland if the following general requirements are met us courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to irish conflict of law rules the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule and the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it 

a judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending but where the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in ireland it remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive irish courts may also refuse to enforce a judgment of the us courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons the judgment is not for a definite sum of money the judgment was obtained by fraud the enforcement of the judgment in ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice the judgment is contrary to irish public policy or involves certain us laws which will not be enforced in ireland or jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service ireland or outside ireland under order 11 of the irish superior courts rules 

as an irish company johnson controls is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company 

generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of johnson controls international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares there is no irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty is payable for certain share transfers a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to johnson controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases johnson controls may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty johnson controls memorandum and articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment johnson controls i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii may have a lien against the johnson controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in johnson controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by johnson controls 

dividends paid by us may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we will be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders shareholders that are residents in the us european union countries other than ireland or other countries with which ireland has signed a tax treaty whether the treaty has been ratified or not generally should not be subject to irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided its broker for onward transmission to our qualifying intermediary or other designated agent in the case of shares held beneficially or us or our transfer agent in the case of shares held directly with all the necessary documentation by the appropriate due date prior to payment of the dividend however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of johnson controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

johnson controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

general risk factors 

general economic political credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to grow or sustain our businesses and our ability to access the capital markets 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets global economic and political conditions affect each of our primary businesses and the businesses of our customers and suppliers any future financial distress or disruption in the industries andor markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods result in future restructuring charges and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our businesses further 

negative economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic in one or more countries or regions in which we operate could require changes to funding certain of our strategic growth investments 

the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide a worldwide economic downturn andor disruption of the credit markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings prevailing industry conditions the volatility of the capital markets or other factors then our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to adequately react to negative economic impacts that decrease demand for our products and services andor negative movements in capital markets our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress notably the global covid19 pandemic created heightened risk that third parties may be unable to perform their obligations or suffer financial distress due to the global economic impact of the pandemic and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments however we are unable predict the impact that covid19 will have on any of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions or their ability to perform their obligations if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims 

risks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets discount rates mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods because we marktomarket our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis large noncash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when a remeasurement event occurs generally accepted accounting principles in the us require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon among other factors interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost refer to critical accounting estimates included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted and the price we pay to issue debt could increase historically we have relied on our ability to issue commercial paper rather than to draw on our credit facility to support our daily operations which means that a downgrade in our ratings or volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 

additionally several of our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our business loss of changes in or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers cancellation of or significant delays in projects in our backlog delays or difficulties in new product development our ability to recognize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions financial instability or market declines of our major component suppliers price increases of limitedsource components products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems and natural or manmade disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers

macroeconomic trends 

much of the demand for installation of the company’s products and solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit positive or negative fluctuations in commercial and residential construction industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects and other capital investments in buildings could have a corresponding impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as a result of the company’s global presence a significant portion of its revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the company is therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while the company employs financial instruments to hedge some of its transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate it completely from those exposures exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could increase or reduce the company’s profit margin in various locations outside of the us and impact the comparability of results from period to period  

the company continues to observe trends demonstrating increased interest and demand for safe efficient and sustainable buildings and seeks to capitalize on these trends to drive growth by developing and delivering technologies and solutions to create smart and healthy buildings in 2020 the company launched its software platform openblue enabling enterprises to manage all aspects of their physical spaces delivering sustainability new occupant experiences and safety and security by combining the company’s building expertise with cuttingedge technology including aipowered service solutions such as remote diagnostics predictive maintenance compliance monitoring and advanced risk assessments the company continues to leverage its install base together with datadriven products and services to offer outcomebased solutions to customers with a focus on generating accelerated growth in services and recurring revenue for the company in january 2021 the company committed to invest 75 percent of its new product research and development in climaterelated innovation to develop sustainable products and services 

the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience increased input material cost inflation and component shortages as well as disruptions and delays in its supply chain as a result of global macroeconomic trends including increased global demand governmentmandated actions in response to covid19 and labor shortages actions taken by the company to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation including expanding and redistributing its supplier network supplier financing price increases and productivity improvements have generally been successful in offsetting some but not all of the impact of these trends as a result these trends have negatively impacted the company’s revenue and margins the company expects that these trends will continue in fiscal year 2022 therefore the company could experience further disruptions shortages and price increases in the future the effect of which will depend on the company’s ability to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these events 

impact of covid19 pandemic 

the global outbreak of covid19 severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and caused a significant contraction in the global economy 

the company’s affiliates employees suppliers customers and others have been and may continue to be restricted or prevented from conducting normal business activities including as a result of shutdowns travel restrictions and other actions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities although shutdown orders and similar restrictions have been lifted in many jurisdictions in conjunction with the global distribution of vaccines challenges in achieving sufficient vaccination levels and the spread of new variants of covid19 have caused some governments to extend or reinstitute restrictions in impacted areas during fiscal 2021 the company’s facilities generally operated at normal levels 

the company continues to focus its efforts on preserving the health and safety of its employees and customers as well as maintaining the continuity of its operations the company modified its business practices in response to the covid19 outbreak including restricting nonessential employee travel implementing remote work protocols and limiting physical participation in meetings events and conferences the company also instituted preventive measures at its facilities including enhanced health and safety protocols temperature screening requiring face coverings for all unvaccinated employees and encouraging employees to follow similar protocols when away from work the company has adopted and implemented a 

multifaceted framework to guide its decision making as it reopens its offices and facilities to employees and will continue to monitor and audit its facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with the company’s covid19 safety requirements 

the company initially experienced a decline in demand and volumes in its global businesses as a result of the impact of efforts to contain the spread of covid19 specifically during portions of fiscal 2020 the company experienced lower demand due to restricted access to customer sites to perform service and installation work as well as reduced discretionary capital spending by the companys customers in fiscal 2021 the company has experienced increases in both demand and volumes as governments have distributed vaccines and lifted covid19related restrictions leading to increases in retrofit activity and to a lesser extent commercial building construction the global pandemic has also provided the company with the opportunity to help its customers prepare to reopen by delivering solutions and support that enhance the safety and increase the efficiency of their operations as a result of the pandemic the company has seen an increase in demand for its products and solutions that promote building health and optimize customers’ infrastructure including thermal cameras indoor air quality locationbased services for contact tracing and touchless access control 

however the company continues to be influenced by covid19related trends impacting site access and the labor force which have and may continue to negatively impact the company’s revenues and margins challenges in reaching sufficient vaccination levels and the introduction of new variants of covid19 have caused some governments to extend or reinstitute lockdowns and similar restrictive measures which in some cases have limited the company’s ability to access customer sites to install and maintain its products and deliver services in addition the company has experienced and continues to experience labor shortages at certain facilities as the company expands its production capacity to meet increased customer demand although the company is mitigating these shortages through focused recruitment efforts and competitive compensation packages the company could continue to experience such shortages in the future recently the us government has promulgated orders mandating vaccinations or regular covid19 testing for large employers and federal contractors the company’s efforts to comply with these mandates including requiring that some or all of its employees be fully vaccinated against covid19 could result in increased labor attrition or disruption and could adversely impact the company’s ability to deliver services to our us federal government customers and potentially other customers 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the resurgence of covid19 and its variants in regions recovering from the impacts of the pandemic the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and the speed at which populations are vaccinated around the globe the impact of covid19 on economic activity and regulatory actions taken to contain its impact on public health and the global economy see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for an additional discussion of risks related to covid19

the company recognizes revenue from certain longterm contracts on an over time basis with progress towards completion measured using a costtocost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion total estimated costs at completion are based primarily on estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends and other economic projections factors that may result in a change to these estimates include unforeseen engineering problems construction delays the performance of subcontractors and major material suppliers and weather conditions as a result changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract such estimates are reviewed monthly and any adjustments to the measure of completion are recognized as adjustments to sales and gross profit using the cumulative catchup method estimated losses are recorded when identified 

for agreements with multiple performance obligations the company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract in order to estimate relative selling price market data and transfer price studies are utilized if the standalone selling price is not directly observable the company estimates the standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach or expected cost plus margin approach 

the company considers the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price including discounts rebates refunds credits or other similar sources of variable consideration when determining the transaction price of each contract the company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved these estimates are based on the amount of consideration that the company expects to be entitled to 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units which have been determined to be the company’s reportable segments or one level below the reportable segments in certain instances using a fair value method based on management’s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in estimating the fair value the company uses the multiples of earnings approach based on the average of published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics that are applied to the companys average of historical and future financial results in certain instances the company uses discounted cash flow analyses or estimated sales price to further support the fair value estimates the assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations the key assumptions used in the impairment tests were managements projections of future cash flows weightedaverage cost of capital and longterm growth rates although the companys cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unit 

based on the fiscal 2021 annual impairment test there were no goodwill impairments and no reporting unit was determined to be at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test 

indefinitelived intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names and are tested for impairment using a relieffromroyalty method a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests the key assumptions used in the impairment tests were longterm revenue growth projections weightedaverage cost of capital and general industry market and macroeconomic conditions 

there were no indefinitelived intangible asset impairments resulting from the fiscal 2021 annual impairment test the estimated fair values of all indefinitelived intangibles substantially exceeded their carrying values with the exception of the indefinitelived trademark related to the companys asia pacific subscriber businesses the estimated fair value of the asia pacific indefinitelived trademark was consistent with its carrying value of 38 million as of september 30 2021 

the company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value while the company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible impairment tests are reasonable different assumptions or changes in general industry market and macroeconomic conditions including a more prolonged andor severe covid19 pandemic could change the estimated fair values and therefore future impairment charges could be required which could be material to the consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement benefits plan assets and obligations are measured annually or more frequently if there is a significant remeasurement event based on the company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases and health care cost trend rates as of that date the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

the company utilizes a marktomarket approach for recognizing pension and postretirement benefit expenses including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event refer to note 16 retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the companys pension and postretirement benefit plans 

us gaap requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are over funded us gaap also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan’s funded status as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year end 

the company considers the expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis when setting assumed discount rates as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for the us pension and postretirement plans the company uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds for the nonus pension and postretirement plans the company consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates the company’s weighted average discount rate on us pension plans was 250 and 225 at september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the company’s weighted average discount rate on postretirement plans was 230 and 190 at september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the company’s weighted average discount rate on nonus pension plans was 180 and 135 at september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets the company considers the historical returns on plan assets adjusted for forwardlooking considerations inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans’ invested assets reflecting the relatively longterm nature of the plans’ obligations approximately 20 of the plans’ assets are invested in equity securities and 68 in fixed income securities with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments for the years ending september 30 2021 and 2020 the company’s expected longterm return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 650 and 690 respectively the actual rate of return on us pension plans was above 650 in fiscal year 2021 and above 690 in fiscal year 2020 for the years ending september 30 2021 and 2020 the company’s weighted average expected longterm return on nonus pension plan assets was 490 and 520 respectively the actual rate of return on nonus pension plans was above 490 in fiscal year 2021 and below 520 in fiscal year 2020 for the years ending september 30 2021 and 2020 the company’s weighted average expected longterm return on postretirement plan assets was 530 and 570 respectively the actual rate of return on postretirement plan assets was above 530 in fiscal year 2021 and below 570 in fiscal year 2020 

beginning in fiscal 2022 the company believes the longterm rate of return will approximate 700 370 and 530 for us pension nonus pension and postretirement plans respectively any differences between actual investment results and the expected longterm asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a significant remeasurement event if the company’s actual returns on plan assets are less than the company’s expectations additional contributions may be required 

in fiscal 2021 total employer contributions for continuing operations to the defined benefit pension plans were 65 million none of which were voluntary contributions made by the company the company expects to contribute approximately 42 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2022 in fiscal 2021 total employer contributions for continuing operations to the postretirement plans were 3 million the company expects to contribute approximately 3 million in cash to its postretirement plans in fiscal 2022 

based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the marktomarket adjustments represent actuarial gains losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experiences different from those assumed that are used to value the plan assets and the benefit obligations the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains losses are changes in the discount rate used to value benefit obligations and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets as such the marktomarket adjustments are highly volatile and are difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments were 365 million 295 million and 630 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the following chart illustrates the estimated increases decreases in projected benefit obligation and future ongoing pension expense which excludes any potential marktomarket adjustments assuming an increase of 25 basis points in the key assumptions for our pension plans in millions 



a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a material impact on our postretirement benefit plan obligations 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental matters selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

the company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment it is difficult to estimate the company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur it is possible that technological regulatory or enforcement developments the results of additional environmental studies or other factors could change the companys expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays and such changes could be material to the companys future results of operations financial condition or cash flows nevertheless the company does not currently believe that any claims penalties or costs in addition to the amounts accrued will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows the company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated refer to note 23 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable the company maintains captive insurance companies to manage its insurable liabilities 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials the companys estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present value from 2068 which is the companys reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestosrelated claims will be filed against company affiliates asbestosrelated defense costs are included in the asbestos liability the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2068 annually the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis the 

company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters the company records asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the companys estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims discounted to present value in determining the amount of insurance recoverable the company considers available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers refer to note 23 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents nonus operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets 

the company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered along with any other positive or negative evidence since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowances may be necessary at september 30 2021 the company had a valuation allowance of 59 billion for continuing operations of which 52 billion relates to net operating loss carryforwards primarily in france germany ireland luxembourg mexico spain united kingdom and the us for which sustainable taxable income has not been demonstrated and 07 billion for other deferred tax assets 

the company’s federal income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the irs and respective nonus tax authorities although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at september 30 2021 the company had recorded a liability of 27 billion for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

the company does not generally provide additional us or nonus income taxes on outside basis differences of consolidated subsidiaries included in shareholders’ equity attributable to johnson controls international plc except in limited circumstances including anticipated taxation on planned divestitures the reduction of the outside basis differences via the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries andor distributions could create taxable income the company’s intent is to reduce the outside basis differences only when it would be tax efficient refer to capitalization within the liquidity and capital resources section for discussion of us and nonus cash projections

risk management 

the company selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency commodities and stockbased compensation all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes at the inception of the 

hedge the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either 1 a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of a recognized firm commitment a fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a nonus operation a net investment hedge the company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used all other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging are revalued in the consolidated statements of income 

for all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test the fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated the hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 for commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges effectiveness is tested using a regression calculation ineffectiveness is minimal as the company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts 

for net investment hedges the company assesses its net investment positions in the nonus operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis the hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a nonus operation does not exceed the company’s net investment positions in the respective nonus operation 

equity swaps and any other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 require no assessment of effectiveness 

a discussion of the company’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 11 derivative instruments and hedging activities and note 12 fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange 

the company has manufacturing sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies in order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the company’s global diversification foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are as appropriate hedged with financial instruments 

the company hedges 70 to 90 of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures the company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items the company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 

the company has entered into foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income aoci account within shareholders’ equity attributable to johnson controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the company’s net investm ents globally 

at september 30 2021 and 2020 the company estimates that an unfavorable 10 change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately 213 million and 363 million respectively 

interest rates 

substantially all of the companys outstanding debt has fixed interest rates a 10 increase in the average cost of the company’s variable rate debt would have had an immaterial impact on pretax interest expense for the years ended september 30 2021 and 2020 

commodities 

the company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines as a cash flow hedge gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business the maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities 

environmental health and safety and other matters 

the company’s global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws under various circumstances these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material

• remaining performance obligations include large multipurpose contracts to construct hospitals schools and other governmental buildings which are services to be performed over the buildings lifetime with initial contract terms of 25 to 35 years for the entire term of the contract versus backlog which includes only the lifecycle period of these contracts which approximates five years 

• the company has elected to exclude from remaining performance obligations certain contracts with customers with a term of one year or less or contracts that are cancelable without substantial penalty while these contracts are included within backlog and 

• remaining performance obligations include the full remaining term of service contracts with substantial termination penalties versus backlog which includes one year for all outstanding service contracts 

the company will continue to report backlog as it believes it is a useful measure of evaluating the companys operational performance and relationship to total orders 

raw materials 

raw materials used by the businesses in connection with their operations including steel aluminum brass copper polypropylene and certain flurochemicals used in fire suppression agents were readily available during fiscal 2020 the company expects such availability to continue in fiscal 2021 commodity prices could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the results of operations

 item 1a   risk factors 

risks related to economic and political conditions 

the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global outbreak of covid19 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and has caused a significant contraction in the global economy in response to this outbreak the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions have taken preventive or protective actions such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations currently the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts and other measures being taken to mitigate the effects of these actions and the spread of covid19 remains uncertain 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we and our affiliates employees suppliers customers and others have been and may continue to be restricted or prevented from conducting normal business activities including as a result of shutdowns travel restrictions and other actions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities such actions have prevented and may in the future prevent us from accessing the facilities of our customers to deliver and install products provide services and complete maintenance although some governments have lifted shutdown orders and similar restrictions a resurgence in the spread of covid19 could cause the reinstitution of such preventive or protective measures while a substantial portion of our businesses have been classified as essential in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated some of our facilities have nevertheless been ordered to close and we can give no assurance that there will not be additional closures in the future or that our businesses will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the covid19 outbreak has impacted and may continue to impact our office locations manufacturing and servicing facilities and distribution centers as well as those of our thirdparty vendors including the effects of facility closures reductions in operating hours and other social distancing efforts for example during portions of fiscal year 2020 we experienced temporary reductions of our manufacturing and operating capacity in india china and mexico as a result of governmentmandated actions to control the spread of covid19 in addition we have modified our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers these modifications to our business practices including any future actions we take may cause us to experience increases in costs reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines further we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain as a result of such actions which have resulted in higher supply chain costs to us in order to maintain the supply of materials and components for our products 

our management of the impact of covid19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees as well as resources across our global enterprise the focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of covid19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments which may adversely impact our future results of operations in addition issues relating to the covid19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us 

we may also experience impacts from market downturns and changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears as a result of covid19 for example we experienced a decline in demand in our global businesses as a result of the impact of efforts to contain the spread of covid19 in addition our customers may choose to delay or abandon projects on which we provide products andor services we may also experience adverse impacts on demand and sales volumes from industries that are sensitive to economic downturns and volatility in commodity prices further the covid19 pandemic could result in permanent changes in the behaviors of our customers including the increased prevalence of remote work and a corresponding decline in demand for the construction and maintenance of commercial buildings any of these impacts could cause our stock price and the operating performances of our businesses to be adversely affected which could require us to incur material impairment restructuring or other charges for example in fiscal year 2020 we were required to record an impairment charge of indefinitelived intangible assets primarily related to our retail business and an impairment of the north america retail reporting units goodwill 

if the covid19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in our global markets experiences a resurgence in markets recovering from the spread of covid19 or if another significant natural disaster or pandemic were to occur in the future our operations in areas impacted by such events could experience further adverse financial impacts due to market changes and other resulting 

events and circumstances the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 the longevity of covid19 the impact of covid19 on economic activity the actions to contain its impacts on public health and the global economy and the speed at which economic activity resumes following the lifting of measures designed to mitigate the spread of covid19 the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

much of the demand for installation of hvac security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit commercial and residential real estate markets are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values could lead to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors could in turn temper demand for new hvac fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance are dependent on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns including the current economic downturn caused by covid19 customers in these industries tend to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could significantly raise the cost of new debt for our customers any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers inside and outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse or stagnant economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with our nonus operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the us some of which are located in emerging markets longterm economic uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which we operate such as asia south america the middle east europe and emerging markets could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements 

in addition as a result of our global presence a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the 

us dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period 

there are other risks that are inherent in our nonus operations including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions laws and regulations including antitrust import export labor and environmental laws and monetary and fiscal policies protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures or impact trade volumes unsettled or unstable political conditions governmentimposed plant or other operational shutdowns backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions corruption natural and manmade disasters hazards and losses violence civil and labor unrest and possible terrorist attacks 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks related to government regulations 

our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws codes and standards and similar foreign laws codes standards and regulations changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses competition or other regulatory investigations can continue for several years be costly to defend and can result in substantial fines if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls antitrust customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets and laws governing certain materials that may be in our products no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations for example existing free trade laws and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement or any successor agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials either directly or through our suppliers could have an impact on our competitive position business and financial results for example certain of our businesses have a significant presence in the united kingdom the “uk” where the success of the brexit referendum in 2016 has continued to cause political and economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the full terms of the uk’s future relationship with the european union will be it is possible that the uk may be at risk of losing access to free trade agreements for goods and services with the eu and other countries which may result in increased tariffs on uk imports and exports that could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

global climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business 

the effects of climate change such as extreme weather conditions create financial risks to our business for example the demand for our products and services such as residential air conditioning equipment may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions the effects of climate change could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks we could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

there is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to global climate change and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert the worst effects of climate change increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change will result in more regional andor federal requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for example policies are being implemented to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants increase building energy 

efficiency and shift away from the combustion of fossil fuels as a heating source in some cases these policies may render our existing technology and products noncompliant particularly within our line of hvac products and solutions as a result we may be required to make increased capital expenditures to improve our product portfolio to meet new regulations and standards while we have been committed to continuous improvements to our product portfolio to meet and exceed anticipated regulatory standard levels there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development 

there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives which if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance these factors may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

we are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters which could adversely affect our business results of operation and reputation 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other things solid and hazardous waste storage treatment and disposal and remediation of releases of hazardous materials there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials for example proposed federal and state legislative action concerning the use and cleanup of firefighting foam products could negatively impact our firefighting business and our results of operations thereby enhancing the risks to our business described under “potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs” below 

federal state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters including but not limited to health safety laws governing employee injuries and permitting requirements in addition to the environmental matters discussed above if we are unable to adequately comply with applicable health and safety regulations and provide our employees with a safe working environment we may be subject to litigation and regulatory action in addition to negatively impacting our ability to attract and retain talented employees new legislation and regulations may require the company to make material changes to its operations resulting in significant increases to the cost of production 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws around the world 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with antibribery laws we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we could be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of such compliance matters or we could be subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the us government 

our customers include many us federal state and local government authorities doing business with the us government and state and local authorities subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the 

government or for failure to perform under the applicable contract we are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations in addition various us federal and state legislative proposals have been made in the past that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

risks related to our business operations 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new products and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive and increasingly complex products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products services and technologies requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer we must also attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products particularly as we increase investment in our digital solutions businesses and our openblue platform the laws and regulations applicable to our products and our customers’ product and service needs change from time to time and regulatory changes may render our products and technologies noncompliant we must also monitor disruptive technologies and business models in addition the markets for our products services and technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors the introduction of new competitors to the market with new or innovative product offerings or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems or integrate existing systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition we are increasingly relying on our it infrastructure to support our operations as we manage the impact of covid19 including through initiating remotework protocols for a substantial number of our employees in regions impacted by the spread of the virus if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system as a result of the increased burden placed on our it infrastructure or a security breach of our it systems including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its third party service providers including cloud providers our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems maintenance of backup and protective systems and the incorporation of cybersecurity design throughout the lifecycle of our products despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations cybersecurity incidents aimed at the 

software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

data privacy identity protection and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks 

we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data our business and our products may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors or errors that could potentially lead to compromising such data improper use of our products systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions a significant actual or perceived risk of theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of customer employee or other data whether by us our suppliers channel partners customers or other third parties as a result of employee error or malfeasance or as a result of the imaging software security and other products we incorporate into our products as well as noncompliance with applicable industry standards or our contractual or other legal obligations or privacy and informationsecurity policies regarding such data could result in costs fines litigation or regulatory actions or could lead customers to select products and services of our competitors in addition any such event could harm our reputation cause unfavorable publicity or otherwise adversely affect certain potential customers’ perception of the security and reliability of our services as well as our credibility and reputation which could result in lost sales in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure for example proposed regulations restricting the use of biometric security technology could impact the products and solutions offered by our security business government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of trademarks trade secrets patents copyrights knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products we from time to time resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings can be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business 

unlike many of our competitors the company relies on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue the direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions and hvac equipment manufactured by the company this represents a significant distribution channel for our products creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and hvac equipment and creates opportunities for longer term service and monitoring revenue if we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business whether due to changes in economic conditions a failure to anticipate changing customer needs a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions or for any other reason our installation revenue could decline which could in turn adversely impact our product pullthrough and our ability to grow service and monitoring revenue 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 97000 people worldwide approximately 21 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works councils other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure in our fire and security businesses than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because many of our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we do not own the right to use the adt® brand name in the us and canada 

we own the adt® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the us and canada and the adt corporation adt owns the brand name in the us and canada although we have entered into agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt® brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the us and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the us and canada any of these factors may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to litigation 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

we have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing and testing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties including our fire technology center and stanton street manufacturing facility located in marinette wisconsin these projects relate to a variety of activities including arsenic solvent oil metal lead perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa andor other per and polyfluorinated substances pfas and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable future expenses that we may incur to remediate identified sites and resolve outstanding litigation could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we have been named along with others in a number of class action and other lawsuits relating to the use of firefighting foam products by the us department of defense the us military and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises plaintiffs generally allege that the firefighting foam products contain or break down into the chemicals pfos and pfoa andor other pfas compounds and that the use of these products by others at various airbases airports and other sites resulted in the release of these chemicals into the environment and ultimately into communities’ drinking water supplies neighboring those airports airbases and other sites plaintiffs in these cases generally seek compensatory damages including damages for alleged personal injuries medical monitoring diminution in property values investigation and remediation costs and natural resources damages and also seek punitive damages and injunctive relief to address remediation of the alleged contamination it is difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure if any represented by these matters and there can be no assurance that any such exposure will not be material such claims may also negatively affect our reputation see note 22 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows see note 22 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

risks relating to strategic transactions 

we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or joint ventures 

we expect acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as joint ventures or other strategic arrangements to play a role in our future growth we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

• the diversion of management attention to integration matters 

• difficulties in integrating operations and systems 

• challenges in conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and 

compensation structures 

• difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel 

• challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers 

• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects 

• contingent liabilities including contingent tax liabilities that are larger than expected and 

• potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquired 

companies 

  

the goodwill and intangible assets recorded with past acquisitions including our merger with tyco were significant and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions 

many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future our joint venture partners may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture in addition we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships our joint venture arrangements may require us among other matters to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner’s consent to take certain actions in addition our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines for example we completed the spinoff of our automotive experience business in october 2016 and sold our scott safety business in october 2017 in addition on april 30 2019 we sold our power solutions business to bcp acquisitions llc divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business some divestitures like the power solutions divestiture may be dilutive to earnings in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may also result in a diversion of management attention operational difficulties and losses with respect to the power solutions divestiture there can be no assurance whether the strategic benefits and expected financial impact of the divestiture will be achieved 

risks related to tax matters 

the internal revenue service irs may not agree that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under current us federal tax law a corporation is generally considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation because johnson controls international plc is an irish incorporated entity it would generally be 

classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules however section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under section 7874 if 1 former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 80 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding johnson controls inc common stock such ownership percentage the section 7874 ownership percentage and 2 our expanded affiliated group did not have substantial business activities in ireland the substantial business activities test we will be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes if the section 7874 ownership percentage of the former johnson controls inc shareholders after the merger was less than 80 but at least 60 and the substantial business activities test was not met we and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco may in some circumstances be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules which among other things could limit their ability to utilize certain us tax attributes to offset us taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions the application of these rules could result in significant additional us tax liability and limit our ability to restructure or access cash earned by certain of our nonus subsidiaries in each case without incurring substantial us tax liabilities 

based on the terms of the merger the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 and certain factual assumptions we believe that former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 less than 60 by both vote and value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding shares of johnson controls inc common stock therefore under current law we believe that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 should otherwise not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the merger 

however the determination of the section 7874 ownership percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties thus there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger 

regardless of any application of section 7874 we are treated as an irish tax resident for irish tax purposes consequently if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and irish taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

future potential changes to the tax laws could adversely affect us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the us which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals and such changes could have a prospective or retroactive application however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding the incorporation in ireland or limiting johnson controls international plc’s ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could be subject to increased taxation potentially significant expense andor other adverse tax consequences additionally the us congress government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organization for economic cooperation and development have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations such as base erosion and profit shifting it is possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to such developments or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect us or our affiliates there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate and if changes are enacted there could be a resulting increase in our effective tax rate additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material increase in our effective tax rate 

changes to the us model income tax treaty could adversely affect us 

on february 17 2016 the us treasury released a revised us model income tax convention the new model which is the baseline text used by the us treasury to negotiate tax treaties if any or all of the modifications to the model treaty are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and substantially increase our worldwide tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific modifications to the model treaty and we cannot provide assurance that any such modifications will not apply to us 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the reversal of outside basis differences that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally changes in tax laws in the us ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

a judgment obtained against us will be enforced by the courts of ireland if the following general requirements are met 

• us courts must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to irish conflict of law rules the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule and 

• the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it 

a judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending but where the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in ireland it remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive irish courts may also refuse to enforce a judgment of the us courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons 

• the judgment is not for a definite sum of money 

• the judgment was obtained by fraud 

• the enforcement of the judgment in ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice 

• the judgment is contrary to irish public policy or involves certain us laws which will not be enforced in ireland or 

• jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service ireland or outside ireland under order 11 of the irish superior courts rules 

as an irish company johnson controls is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of johnson controls international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares there is no irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty is payable for certain share transfers a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a 

transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to johnson controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases johnson controls may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty johnson controls memorandum and articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment johnson controls i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii may have a lien against the johnson controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in johnson controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by johnson controls 

dividends paid by us may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we will be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders shareholders that are residents in the us european union countries other than ireland or other countries with which ireland has signed a tax treaty whether the treaty has been ratified or not generally should not be subject to irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided its broker for onward transmission to our qualifying intermediary or other designated agent in the case of shares held beneficially or us or our transfer agent in the case of shares held directly with all the necessary documentation by the appropriate due date prior to payment of the dividend however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of johnson controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

johnson controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

general risk factors 

general economic political credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to grow or sustain our businesses and our ability to access the capital markets 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets global economic and political conditions affect each of our primary businesses and the businesses of our customers and suppliers any future financial distress or disruption in the industries andor markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods result in future restructuring charges and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our businesses further negative economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic in one or more countries or regions in which we operate could require changes to funding certain of our strategic growth investments 

the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide a worldwide economic downturn andor disruption of the credit markets including the economic downturn and capital market volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings prevailing industry conditions the volatility of the capital markets or other factors then our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to adequately react to negative economic impacts that decrease demand for our products and services andor negative movements in capital markets our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress notably the global covid19 pandemic has created heightened risk that third parties may be unable to perform their obligations or suffer financial distress due to the global economic impact of the pandemic and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments to contain the spread of the virus however we are unable predict the impact that covid19 will have on any of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions or their ability to perform their obligations if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership organizational and reporting changes resulting from any future leadership transition or corporate initiatives could result in increased turnover additionally any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 

increases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed therefore in the shortterm our ability to adjust for changes in certain commodity prices is limited in these cases if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply based fixedprice contracts we use commodity hedge contracts to minimize overall price risk associated with our anticipated commodity purchases unfavorability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level additionally to the extent we do not or are unable to hedge certain commodities and the commodity prices substantially increase such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets discount rates mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods because we marktomarket our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis large noncash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when a remeasurement event occurs generally accepted accounting principles in the us require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon among other factors interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost refer to critical accounting estimates and policies included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted and the price we pay to issue debt could increase historically we have relied on our ability to issue commercial paper rather than to draw on our credit facility to support our daily operations which means that a downgrade in our ratings or volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 

additionally several of our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our business loss of changes in or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers cancellation of or significant delays in projects in our backlog delays or difficulties in new product development our ability to recognize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions financial instability or market declines of our major component suppliers the unavailability of raw materials primarily steel copper and electronic components necessary for production of our products price increases of limitedsource components products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems and natural or manmade disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers

impact of covid19 pandemic 

the global outbreak of covid19 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and has caused a significant contraction in the global economy in response to this outbreak the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations 

the company’s affiliates employees suppliers customers and others have been and may continue to be restricted or prevented from conducting normal business activities including as a result of shutdowns travel restrictions and other actions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities such actions have and may in the future prevent the company from accessing the facilities of its customers to deliver and install products provide services and complete maintenance in addition some of the company’s customers have chosen to delay or abandon projects on which the company provides products andor services as a result of such actions although some governments have lifted shutdown orders and similar restrictions a resurgence in the spread of covid19 could cause the reinstitution of such preventive or protective measures while a substantial portion of the companys businesses have been classified as an essential business in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated some of its facilities have nevertheless been ordered to close and we can give no assurance that there will not be additional closures in the future or that our businesses will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

in response to the challenges presented by covid19 the company has focused its efforts on preserving the health and safety of its employees and customers as well as maintaining the continuity of its operations the company has modified its business practices in response to the covid19 outbreak including restricting nonessential employee travel implementation of remote work protocols and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences the company has also instituted preventive measures at its facilities including enhanced health and safety protocols temperature screening requiring face coverings for all employees and encouraging employees to follow similar protocols when away from work the company has adopted a multifaceted framework to guide its decision making when evaluating the readiness of its facilities to safely reopen and operate and will continue to monitor and audit its facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with the company’s covid19 safety requirements 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 the company experienced a temporary reduction of its manufacturing and operating capacity in china as a result of governmentmandated actions to control the spread of covid19 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company experienced similar reductions as a result of governmentmandated actions in india and mexico during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the company’s facilities were generally able to operate at normal levels though its manufacturing capacity in india continues to be reduced as a result of continued lockdowns in the region the company has experienced and may continue to experience disruptions or delays in its supply chain as a result of governmentmandated actions which has resulted in higher supply chain costs to the company in order to maintain the supply of materials and components for its products 

in order to mitigate disruptions to its supply chain and manufacturing capacity the company took actions including redistributing its manufacturing capacity to facilities and regions unaffected by shutdown orders accelerating the purchase and shipment of components from suppliers in identified hot spots diversifying the company’s supplier base conducting government outreach to support the company’s and its suppliers’ designations as essential businesses and expanded its existing supplier financing programs to support supplier viability and business continuity while these actions have generally been successful in preserving the company’s supply chain and manufacturing capacity the potential resurgence of covid19 in various jurisdictions could lead to further disruptions 

the company experienced a decline in demand and volumes in its global businesses as a result of the impact of efforts to contain the spread of covid19 specifically the company experienced lower demand due to restricted access to customer sites to perform service and installation work as well as reduced discretionary capital spending by the companys customers in response the company quickly moved to execute temporary and permanent cost mitigation actions to offset a portion of the impact of covid19 on the demand for its products and services such as deferring or reducing capital expenditures implementing cost structure changes shortterm furloughing of salaried employees and limiting discretionary spending including corporate expense these measures were in addition to the companys previously disclosed fiscal 2020 restructuring plan although the company intends that the temporary cost mitigation actions initiated in fiscal 2020 will cease in fiscal 2021 the necessity of future cost mitigation actions will depend on the continued impact of covid19 which is highly uncertain 

the global pandemic has also provided the company with the opportunity to help its customers prepare to reopen by delivering solutions and support that enhance the safety and increase the efficiency of their operations the company has seen an increase in demand for its products and solutions that promote building health and optimize customers’ infrastructure including thermal cameras indoor air quality locationbased services for contact tracing and touchless access control 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 the company determined that it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain of its indefinitelived intangible assets due to declines in revenue directly attributable to the covid19 pandemic as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 62 million related primarily to the companys retail business indefinitelived intangible assets within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company determined that it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain of its indefinitelived intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill due to declines in revenue and further declines in forecasted cash flows in its north america retail reporting unit directly attributable to the covid19 pandemic as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 424 million related to the companys north america retail reporting units goodwill within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 there were no indefinitelived intangibles or goodwill impairments resulting from the fiscal 2020 annual impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 however it is possible that future changes in such circumstances including a more prolonged andor severe covid19 pandemic would require the company to record additional noncash impairment charges 

the company continues to actively monitor its liquidity position and working capital needs the company believes that following its implementation of liquidity and cost mitigation actions in fiscal 2020 it remains in a solid overall capital resources and liquidity position that is adequate to meet its projected needs as a result following a review of its liquidity position the company resumed its share repurchase program in july 2020 which had been suspended in march 2020 in september 2020 the company issued 18 billion of senior notes a portion of the proceeds together with cash from operations were used to repay shortterm debt obligations incurred by the company at the onset of the pandemic to preserve its nearterm financial flexibility as well as repay or redeem other near termindebtedness 

the extent to which the covid19 outbreak continues to impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and longevity of covid19 the resurgence of covid19 in regions that have begun to recover from the initial impact of the pandemic the impact of covid19 on economic activity and the actions to contain its impact on

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures actual results could differ from those estimates the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue from certain longterm contracts to design manufacture and install building products and systems as well as unscheduled repair or replacement services on an over time basis with progress towards completion measured using a costtocost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion the costtocost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the company incurs costs changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed monthly if contract modifications result in additional goods or services that are distinct from those transferred before the modification they are accounted for prospectively as if the company entered into a new contract if the goods or services in the modification are not distinct from those in the original contract sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catchup method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values estimated losses are recorded when identified the company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as at contract inception the company expects to receive the payment within twelve months of transfer of goods or services 

the company enters into extended warranties and longterm service and maintenance agreements with certain customers for these arrangements revenue is recognized over time on a straightline basis over the respective contract term 

the company also sells certain hvac and refrigeration products and services in bundled arrangements with multiple performance obligations such as equipment commissioning service labor and extended warranties approximately four to twelve months separate the timing of the first deliverable until the last piece of equipment is delivered and there may be extended warranty arrangements with duration of one to five years commencing upon the end of the standard warranty period in addition the company sells security monitoring systems that may have multiple performance obligations including equipment installation monitoring services and maintenance agreements revenues associated with the sale of equipment and related installations are recognized over time on a costtocost input method while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are rendered the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative selling price method in order to estimate relative selling price market data and transfer price studies are utilized if the standalone selling price is not directly observable the company estimates the standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach or expected cost plus margin approach for transactions in which the company retains ownership of the subscriber system asset fees for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized over time on a straightline basis over the contract term nonrefundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract along with associated direct and incremental selling costs are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the contract 

in all other cases the company recognizes revenue at the point in time when control over the goods or services transfers to the customer 

the company considers the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price including discounts rebates refunds credits or other similar sources of variable consideration when determining the transaction price of each contract the company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved these estimates are based on the amount of consideration that the company expects to be entitled to 

shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost of sales when control transfers to the customer the company presents amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes net of the related amounts remitted refer to note 4 revenue recognition of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the companys revenue recognition activity 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units which have been determined to be the company’s reportable segments or one level below the reportable segments in certain instances using a fair value method based on management’s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in estimating the fair value the company uses multiples of earnings based on the average of published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics and applies to the companys average of historical and future financial results in certain instances the company uses discounted cash flow analyses or estimated sales price to further support the fair value estimates the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc 820 fair value measurement the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value the assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations the primary assumptions used in the impairment tests were managements projections of future cash flows although the companys cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unit refer to note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 

indefinitelived intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names and are tested for impairment using a relieffromroyalty method a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests the key assumptions used in the impairment tests were longterm revenue growth projections discount rates and general industry market and macroeconomic conditions 

while the company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the impairment tests are reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and therefore future impairment charges could be required which could be material to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

the company reviews longlived assets including tangible assets and other intangible assets with definitive lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable the company conducts its longlived asset impairment analyses in accordance with asc 3601015 impairment or disposal of longlived assets asc 35030 general intangibles other than goodwill and asc 98520 costs of software to be sold leased or marketed asc 3601015 requires the company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows if the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals asc 35030 requires intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities be considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts during the period that those assets are considered indefinite lived they shall not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an entity shall recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess asc 98520 requires the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product be compared to the net realizable value of that product the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product exceed the net realizable value of that asset shall be written off refer to note 17 impairment of longlived assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impairment testing performed in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 

employee benefit plans 

the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement benefits plan assets and obligations are measured annually or more frequently if there is a significant remeasurement event based on the company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of 

return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

the company utilizes a marktomarket approach for recognizing pension and postretirement benefit expenses including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event refer to note 15 retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the companys pension and postretirement benefit plans 

us gaap requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are over funded us gaap also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan’s funded status as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year end 

the company considers the expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis when setting assumed discount rates as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for the us pension and postretirement plans the company uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds for the nonus pension and postretirement plans the company consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates the company’s weighted average discount rate on us pension plans was 225 and 295 at september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively the company’s weighted average discount rate on postretirement plans was 190 and 265 at september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively the company’s weighted average discount rate on nonus pension plans was 135 and 150 at september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets the company considers the historical returns on plan assets adjusted for forwardlooking considerations inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans’ invested assets reflecting the relatively longterm nature of the plans’ obligations approximately 27 of the plans’ assets are invested in equity securities and 63 in fixed income securities with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments for the years ending september 30 2020 and 2019 the company’s expected longterm return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 690 and 710 respectively the actual rate of return on us pension plans was above 690 in fiscal year 2020 and above 710 in fiscal year 2019 for the years ending september 30 2020 and 2019 the company’s weighted average expected longterm return on nonus pension plan assets was 520 and 520 respectively the actual rate of return on nonus pension plans was below 520 in fiscal year 2020 and above 520 in fiscal year 2019 for the years ending september 30 2020 and 2019 the company’s weighted average expected longterm return on postretirement plan assets was 570 and 565 respectively the actual rate of return on postretirement plan assets was below 570 in fiscal year 2020 and below 565 in fiscal year 2019 

beginning in fiscal 2021 the company believes the longterm rate of return will approximate 650 490 and 530 for us pension nonus pension and postretirement plans respectively any differences between actual investment results and the expected longterm asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a significant remeasurement event if the company’s actual returns on plan assets are less than the company’s expectations additional contributions may be required 

in fiscal 2020 total employer contributions for continuing operations to the defined benefit pension plans were 58 million none of which were voluntary contributions made by the company the company expects to contribute approximately 46 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2020 total employer contributions for continuing operations to the postretirement plans were 3 million the company expects to contribute approximately 3 million in cash to its postretirement plans in fiscal 2021 

based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings environmental matters selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

the company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment the company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated refer to note 22 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable the company maintains captive insurance companies to manage its insurable liabilities 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials the companys estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present value from 2068 which is the companys reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestosrelated claims will be filed against company affiliates asbestosrelated defense costs are included in the asbestos liability the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2068 annually the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters the company records asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the companys estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims discounted to present value in determining the amount of insurance recoverable the company considers available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers refer to note 22 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents nonus operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period on a quarterly basis the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 

the company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered along with any other positive or negative evidence since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowances may be necessary at september 30 2020 the company had a valuation allowance of 55 billion for continuing operations of which 53 billion relates to net operating loss carryforwards primarily in france germany ireland luxembourg spain united kingdom and the us for which sustainable taxable income has not been demonstrated and 02 billion for other deferred tax assets 

the company’s federal income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the irs and respective nonus tax authorities although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at september 30 2020 the company had recorded a liability of 25 billion for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 

the company does not generally provide additional us or nonus income taxes on outside basis differences of consolidated subsidiaries included in shareholders’ equity attributable to johnson controls international plc except in limited circumstances including anticipated taxation on planned divestitures the reduction of the outside basis differences via the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries andor distributions could create taxable income the company’s intent is to reduce the outside basis differences only when it would be tax efficient refer to capitalization within the liquidity and capital resources section for discussion of us and nonus cash projections

refer to the new accounting pronouncements section within note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

risk management 

the company selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency commodities and stockbased compensation all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes at the inception of the hedge the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either 1 a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of a recognized firm commitment a fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a nonus operation a net investment hedge the company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used all other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging are revalued in the consolidated statements of income 

for all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test the fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated the hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 for commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges effectiveness is tested using a regression calculation ineffectiveness is minimal as the company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts 

for net investment hedges the company assesses its net investment positions in the nonus operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis the hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a nonus operation does not exceed the company’s net investment positions in the respective nonus operation 

equity swaps and any other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 require no assessment of effectiveness 

a discussion of the company’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities and note 11 fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange 

the company has manufacturing sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies in order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the company’s global diversification foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are as appropriate hedged with financial instruments 

the company hedges 70 to 90 of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures the company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items the company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 

the company has entered into foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income aoci account within shareholders’ equity attributable to johnson controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the company’s net investm ents globally 

at september 30 2020 and 2019 the company estimates that an unfavorable 10 change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately 363 million and 358 million respectively 

interest rates 

substantially all of the companys outstanding debt has fixed interest rates a 10 increase in the average cost of the company’s variable rate debt would have had an immaterial impact on pretax interest expense for the year ended september 30 2020 and 2019 

commodities 

the company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines as a cash flow hedge gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business the maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities 

environmental health and safety and other matters 

the company’s global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws under various circumstances these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material

on november 13 2018 the company entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement “purchase agreement” with bcp acquisitions llc “purchaser” the purchaser is a newlyformed entity controlled by investment funds managed by brookfield capital partners llc pursuant to the purchase agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions therein the company agreed to sell and purchaser agreed to acquire the company’s power solutions business for a purchase price of 132 billion the transaction closed on april 30 2019 with net cash proceeds of 116 billion after tax and transactionrelated expenses 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the company determined that its power solutions business met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and as a result power solutions historical financial results are reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation and assets and liabilities were retrospectively reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale 

the company is a global market leader in engineering developing manufacturing and installing building products and systems around the world including hvac equipment hvac controls energymanagement systems security systems fire detection systems and fire suppression solutions the company further serves customers by providing technical services in the hvac security and fireprotection space energymanagement consulting and datadriven solutions via its dataenabled business finally the company has a strong presence in the north american residential air conditioning and heating systems market and is a global market leader in industrial refrigeration products 

productssystems and services 

the company sells its integrated control systems security systems firedetection systems equipment and services primarily through its extensive global network of sales and service offices with operations in approximately 70 countries significant sales are also generated through global thirdparty channels such as distributors of airconditioning security firedetection and commercial hvac systems the company’s large base of current customers leads to significant repeat business for the retrofit and replacement markets in addition the new commercial construction market is also important trusted buildings brands such as york® hitachi air conditioning metasys ® ansul ruskin®  titus® frick® penn® sabroe® simplex® and grinnell® give the company the most diverse portfolio in the building technology industry 

in fiscal 2019  approximately 26 of its sales originated from its service offerings 

competition 

the company conducts its operations through thousands of individual contracts that are either negotiated or awarded on a competitive basis key factors in the award of contracts include system and service performance quality price design reputation technology application engineering capability and construction or project management expertise competitors for hvac equipment security firedetection fire suppression and controls in the residential and nonresidential marketplace include many regional national and international providers larger competitors include honeywell international inc siemens building technologies an operating group of siemens ag schneider electric sa carrier corporation a subsidiary of united technologies corporation trane incorporated a subsidiary of ingersollrand public limited company daikin industries ltd lennox international inc gc midea holding co ltd and gree electric appliances inc in addition to hvac equipment the company competes in a highly fragmented hvac services market which is dominated by local providers the loss of any individual contract would not have a material adverse effect on the company 

backlog 

the company’s backlog is applicable to its sales of systems and services at september 30 2019  the backlog was 92 billion of which 89 billion is attributable to the field business the backlog amount outstanding at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the company adopted accounting standards codification asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” and as a result is required to disclose remaining performance obligations at september 30 2019  remaining performance obligations were 144 billion which is 52 billion higher than the companys backlog of 92 billion differences between the company’s remaining performance obligations and backlog are primarily due to 

 

the company will continue to report backlog as it believes it is a useful measure of evaluating the companys operational performance and relationship to total orders 

raw materials 

raw materials used by the businesses in connection with their operations including steel aluminum brass copper polypropylene and certain flurochemicals used in fire suppression agents were readily available during fiscal 2019  and the company expects such availability to continue in fiscal 2020 commodity prices could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the results of operations 

intellectual property 

generally the company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by contracts licenses confidentiality or other agreements 

the company owns numerous us and nonus patents and their respective counterparts the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products while the company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset no single patent or group of patents is critical to the success of the business the company from time to time grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others

environmental health and safety matters 

laws addressing the protection of the environment environmental laws and workers’ safety and health worker safety laws govern the company’s ongoing global operations they generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where companyrelated materials have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the company’s businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances 

the company’s operations and facilities have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties see note 22 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters 

environmental capital expenditures 

the company’s ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions however expenditures in fiscal 2019 related solely to environmental compliance were not material it is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year see note 22 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters

risk factors 

tableend 

risks relating to business operations 

general economic credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to grow or sustain our businesses and our ability to access the capital markets 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets global economic conditions affect each of our primary businesses as we discuss in greater detail in the specific risk factors for each of our businesses that appear below any future financial distress in the industries andor markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods result in future restructuring charges and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our businesses 

the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide a worldwide economic downturn andor disruption of the credit markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings prevailing industry conditions the volatility of the capital markets or other factors then our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

much of the demand for installation of hvac security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit commercial and residential real estate markets are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values could lead to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors could in turn temper demand for new hvac fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could significantly raise the cost of new debt for our customers any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers inside and outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse or stagnant economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 

increases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed therefore in the shortterm our ability to adjust for changes in certain commodity prices is limited in these cases if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply based fixed price contracts we use commodity hedge contracts to minimize overall price risk associated with our anticipated commodity purchases unfavorability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level additionally to the extent we do not or are unable to hedge certain commodities and the commodity prices substantially increase such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business 

unlike many of our competitors the company relies on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue the direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions and hvac equipment manufactured by the company this represents a significant distribution channel for our products creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and hvac equipment and creates opportunities for longer term service and monitoring revenue if we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business whether due to changes in economic conditions a failure to anticipate changing customer needs a failure 

to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions or for any other reason our installation revenue could decline which could in turn adversely impact our product pull through and our ability to grow service and monitoring revenue 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive and increasingly complex products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products services and technologies requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer we must also attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products particularly as we increase investment in our digital solutions businesses we must also monitor disruptive technologies and business models in addition the markets for our products services and technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with our nonus operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the us some of which are located in emerging markets longterm economic uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which we operate such as asia south america the middle east europe and emerging markets could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements 

in addition as a result of our global presence a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period 

there are other risks that are inherent in our nonus operations including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions laws and regulations including antitrust import export labor and environmental laws and monetary and fiscal policies protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures or impact trade volumes unsettled political conditions governmentimposed plant or other operational shutdowns backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions corruption natural and manmade disasters hazards and losses violence civil and labor unrest and possible terrorist attacks 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws codes and standards and similar foreign laws codes standards and regulations changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses competition or other regulatory investigations can continue for several years be costly to defend and can result in substantial fines if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security 

the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls antitrust customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets and laws governing certain materials that may be in our products no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations for example existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement or any successor agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials either directly or through our suppliers could have an impact on our competitive position business and financial results for example certain of our businesses have a significant presence in the united kingdom the “uk” where the success of the brexit referendum in 2016 has continued to cause political and economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the full terms of the uk’s future relationship with the european union will be it is possible that the uk may be at risk of losing access to free trade agreements for goods and services with the eu and other countries which may result in increased tariffs on uk imports and exports that could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems or integrate existing systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system or a security breach of our it systems including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its products its customers andor its third party service providers including cloud providers our customers including the us government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems despite these efforts cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third parties theft of intellectual property fines levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

data privacy identity protection and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks 

we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors or errors that could potentially lead to compromising such data improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure for example the state of california has passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of internet of things devices which will go into effect in january 2020 european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe the european union general data protection regulation which took effect in may 2018 superseded prior european union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance and several other countries have 

passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws around the world 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with antibribery laws we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we could be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of such compliance matters or we could be subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the us government 

our customers include many us federal state and local government authorities doing business with the us government and state and local authorities subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for failure to perform under the applicable contract we are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations in addition various us federal and state legislative proposals have been made in the past that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of trademarks trade secrets patents copyrights knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming and the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

global climate change could negatively affect our business 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives which if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance these factors may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

there is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to global climate changes climate changes such as extreme weather conditions create financial risk to our business for example the demand for our products and services such as residential air conditioning equipment may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions climate changes could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks the company could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and process disruptions due to physical climate changes could result in price modifications for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

we have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing and testing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties including our fire technology center and stanton street manufacturing facility located in marinette wisconsin these projects relate to a variety of activities including arsenic solvent oil metal lead perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa andor other per and poly fluorinated substances pfas and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable future expenses that we may incur to remediate identified sites could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows see note 22 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

we are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters which could adversely affect our business results of operation and reputation 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other things solid and hazardous waste storage treatment and disposal and remediation of releases of hazardous materials there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials 

federal state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters including but not limited to health safety and permitting in addition to the environmental matters discussed above new legislation and regulations may require the company to make material changes to its operations resulting in significant increases to the cost of production 

we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including 

entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the amounts we have recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets in the consolidated statements of financial position are based on our current strategy for resolving asbestos claims currently available information and a number of variables estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants and the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in our calculations vary significantly from actual results if actual liabilities are significantly higher than those recorded the cost of resolving such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets discount rates mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods because we marktomarket our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis large noncash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when a remeasurement event occurs generally accepted accounting principles in the us require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon among other factors interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost refer to critical accounting estimates and policies included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions which could adversely affect our profitability and operations 

to align our resources with our growth strategies operate more efficiently and control costs we periodically announce restructuring plans which may include workforce reductions global plant closures and consolidations asset impairments and other cost reduction initiatives we may undertake additional restructuring actions and workforce reductions in the future as these plans and actions are complex unforeseen factors could result in expected savings and benefits to be delayed or not realized to the full extent planned and our operations and business may be disrupted 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the reversal of outside basis differences that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally changes in tax laws in the us ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

future changes in us tax law could adversely affect us or our affiliates 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law a bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja which made significant changes to certain us tax laws relevant to us and our affiliates while interpretations of the provisions of the tcja continue to be subject to uncertainty and regulatory guidance on certain aspects of the tcja has not yet been issued the tjca is expected to have an adverse effect on the us federal income taxation of our and our affiliates’ 

operations including limiting or eliminating various deductions or credits including interest expense deductions and deductions relating to employee compensation imposing taxes on certain crossborder payments or transfers imposing taxes on certain earnings of nonus entities on a current basis changing the timing of the recognition of income or its character limiting asset basis under certain circumstances and imposing additional corporate taxes under certain circumstances to combat perceived base erosion issues among other changes 

the tcja and any related legislation or regulations as well as any other future changes in us tax laws could adversely affect the us federal income taxation of our and our affiliates’ ongoing operations and may also adversely affect the integration efforts relating to and potential synergies from past strategic transactions as described below any such changes and related consequences could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows see note 18 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact the tcja had on our business financial performance and results of operations 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims in addition we have been named along with others in a number of class action and other lawsuits relating to the use of firefighting foam products by the us department of defense the us military and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises plaintiffs generally allege that the firefighting foam products contain or break down into the chemicals pfos and pfoa andor other pfas compounds and that the use of these products by others at various airbases airports and other sites resulted in the release of these chemicals into the environment and ultimately into communities’ drinking water supplies neighboring those airports airbases and other sites plaintiffs in these cases generally seek compensatory damages including damages for alleged personal injuries medical monitoring diminution in property values investigation and remediation costs and natural resources damages and also seek punitive damages and injunctive relief to address remediation of the alleged contamination it is difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure if any represented by these matters and there can be no assurance that any such exposure will not be material such claims may also negatively affect our reputation see note 22 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt historically we have relied on our ability to issue commercial paper rather than to draw on our credit facility to support our daily operations which means that a downgrade in our ratings or volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 

additionally several of our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be unable to complete or integrate acquisitions or joint ventures effectively which may adversely affect our growth profitability and results of operations 

we expect acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as joint ventures or other strategic arrangements to play a role in our future growth we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses additionally we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses or joint ventures into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies which could result in impairment of assets including goodwill and acquired intangible assets given the significance of the companys past acquisitions the goodwill and intangible assets recorded were significant and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions if we were to use equity securities to finance a future acquisition our thencurrent shareholders would experience dilution we are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior these and other factors related to acquisitions and joint ventures may negatively and adversely impact our growth profitability and results of operations 

risks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future our joint venture partners may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture in addition we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships our joint venture arrangements may require us among other matters to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner’s consent to take certain actions in addition our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain administrative functions 

we have been regionally centralizing certain administrative functions primarily in north america europe and asia to improve efficiency and reduce costs to the extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled key business processes such as invoicing payments and general management operations could be interrupted which could have an adverse impact on our business 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan organizational and reporting changes resulting from the merger or as a result of any future leadership transition or corporate initiatives could result in increased turnover additionally any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 104000 people worldwide approximately 21 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works council other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure in our fire and security businesses than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because many of our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our installation service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances and we typically maintain product liability insurance to mitigate the risk that our products and services fail to operate as expected however in the event of litigation it is possible that contract limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable that our insurance coverage is not adequate or that insurance carriers deny coverage of our claims as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we do not own the right to use the adt® brand name in the us and canada 

we own the adt® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the us and canada and the adt corporation adt owns the brand name in the us and canada although tyco has entered into agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt® brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the us and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the us and canada any of these factors may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies 

police departments in a limited number of jurisdictions do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance we have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies in most cases through contracts with us which increases the overall cost to customers if more police departments whether inside or outside the us were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our business loss of changes in or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers cancellation of or significant delays in projects in our backlog delays or difficulties in new product development the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies financial instability or market declines of our major component suppliers the unavailability of raw materials primarily steel copper and electronic components necessary for production of our products price increases of limitedsource components products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems revisions to energy efficiency or refrigerant legislation and natural or manmade disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers 

risks relating to strategic transactions 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination between johnson controls inc and tyco international plc 

the success of the merger will depend on among other things our ability to combine the legacy businesses of johnson controls and tyco in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by us we expect to benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and branch optimization as well as greater tax efficiencies from global management and global cash movement we may also enjoy revenue synergies including product and service crossselling a more diversified and expanded product offering and balance across geographic regions however we must successfully combine the legacy businesses of johnson controls and tyco in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized in addition we must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives we may not realize fully or at all the anticipated benefits of the merger or it may take longer to realize the benefits than expected 

other factors may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger or impact our future performance these include among other items the possibility that the contingent liabilities of either party including contingent tax liabilities are larger than expected the existence of unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger and possible adverse tax consequences pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws including most recently the tcja regulations or other administrative guidance in addition we may be subject to additional restrictions as a result of the companys irish domicile 

we may encounter significant difficulties in combining the legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses 

the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we continue to devote significant management attention and resources to combining the business practices and operations of the legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses this process may disrupt the businesses the failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect our results of operations the overall combination of legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

• the diversion of management attention to integration matters 

• difficulties in integrating operations and systems 

• challenges in conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and 

compensation structures between the two companies 

• difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel 

• challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers 

• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from the 

combination 

• difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company 

• contingent liabilities including contingent tax liabilities that are larger than expected and 

• potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger 

including possible adverse tax consequences to the combined company pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws or 

regulations 

many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company 

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines for example on october 31 2016 we completed the spinoff of our automotive experience business and sold our scott safety business in october 2017 in addition on april 30 2019 we sold our power solutions business to bcp acquisitions llc divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business some divestitures like the power solutions divestiture may be dilutive to earnings in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may also result in a diversion of management attention operational difficulties and losses with respect to the power solutions divestiture there can be no assurance whether the strategic benefits and expected financial impact of the divestiture will be achieved 

the internal revenue service irs may not agree that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes and may not agree that the our us affiliates should not be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules 

under current us federal tax law a corporation is generally considered for us federal tax purposes to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation because johnson controls international plc is an irish incorporated entity it would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules however section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under section 7874 if 1 former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 80 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding johnson controls inc common stock the 80 ownership test and such ownership percentage the section 7874 ownership percentage and 2 our expanded affiliated group did not have substantial business activities in ireland the substantial business activities test we will be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes if the section 7874 ownership percentage of the former johnson controls inc shareholders after the merger was less than 80 but at least 60 the 60 ownership test and the substantial business activities test was not met we and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco may in some circumstances be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules which among other things could limit their ability to utilize certain us tax attributes to offset us taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions 

based on the terms of the merger the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 and certain factual assumptions we believe that former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 less than 60 by both vote and value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding shares of johnson controls inc common stock therefore under current law we believe that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 should otherwise not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the merger 

however the rules under section 7874 are complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application in particular ownership for purposes of section 7874 is subject to various adjustments under the code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and there is limited guidance regarding section 7874 including with respect to the application of the ownership tests described therein as a result the determination of the section 7874 ownership percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties thus there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger 

in addition on january 13 2017 and july 11 2018 the us treasury and the irs finalized certain treasury regulations issued under section 7874 and revised certain related temporary regulations the section 7874 regulations which among other things require certain adjustments that generally increase for purposes of the section 7874 ownership tests the percentage of the stock of a foreign acquiring corporation deemed owned within the meaning of section 7874 by the former shareholders of an acquired us corporation by reason of holding stock in such us corporation for example these regulations disregard for purposes of determining this ownership percentage 1 any nonordinary course distributions within the meaning of the regulations made by the acquired us corporation such as johnson controls inc during the 36 months preceding the acquisition including certain dividends and share repurchases 2 potentially any cash consideration received by the shareholders of such us corporation in the acquisition to the extent such cash is directly or indirectly provided by the us corporation as well as 3 certain stock of 

the foreign acquiring corporation that was issued as consideration in a prior acquisition of another us corporation or us partnership during the 36 months preceding the signing date of a binding contract for the acquisition being tested taking into account the effect of these regulations we believe that the section 7874 ownership percentage of former johnson controls inc shareholders in us was less than 60 however these regulations are complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully assert that either the 80 ownership test or the 60 ownership test was met after the merger 

if the 80 ownership test was met after the merger and we were accordingly treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we would be subject to substantial additional us tax liability additionally in such case our nonus shareholders would be subject to us withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we pay to such shareholders subject to an exemption or reduced rate available under an applicable tax treaty regardless of any application of section 7874 we are treated as an irish tax resident for irish tax purposes consequently if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and irish taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if the 60 ownership test were met several adverse us federal income tax rules could apply to our us affiliates in particular in such case section 7874 could limit the ability of such us affiliates to utilize certain us tax attributes including net operating losses and certain tax credits to offset any taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions including any transfers or licenses of property to a foreign related person during the 10year period following the merger the section 7874 regulations generally expand the scope of these rules if the 60 ownership test were met after the merger such current and future limitations would apply to our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco and their application could limit their ability to utilize such us tax attributes against any income or gain recognized in connection with the adient spinoff in such case the application of such rules could result in significant additional us tax liability in addition the section 7874 regulations and certain related temporary regulations issued under other provisions of the code include rules that would apply if the 60 ownership test were met which in such situation may limit our ability to restructure or access cash earned by certain of our nonus subsidiaries in each case without incurring substantial us tax liabilities 

future potential changes to the tax laws could result in our being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or in us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco being subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules 

as discussed above under current law we believe that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger however changes to section 7874 or the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes or could result in the application of certain adverse us federal income tax rules to us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application and may apply even though the merger has been consummated if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes or if we or our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco were to become subject to such adverse us federal income tax rules we and our us affiliates could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated 

certain legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of us corporate tax residence including in such a way as would cause us to be treated as a us corporation if our place of management and control or the place of management and control of our nonus affiliates were determined to be located primarily in the united states in addition certain legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of section 7874 or otherwise address certain perceived issues arising in connection with socalled inversion transactions for example multiple proposals introduced by certain democratic members of both houses of congress which if enacted in their present form would be effective retroactively to certain transactions including the merger would among other things treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 if the former shareholders of a us corporation acquired by such foreign acquiring corporation own more than 50 of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition these proposals if enacted in their present form and made retroactive to a date before the date of the closing of the merger would cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes in such case we would be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated it is presently uncertain whether any such proposals or other legislative action relating to the scope of us tax residence section 7874 or socalled inversion transactions and inverted groups will be enacted into law 

other legislative andor other proposals relating to us taxation could also have a material impact on our future financial results the recently enacted tcja introduced significant changes to certain us tax laws relevant to us and our affiliates including limitations on the deductibility of certain interest expense and employee compensation limitations on various other deductions and credits the imposition of taxes in respect of certain crossborder payments or transfers the imposition of taxes on certain earnings of nonus entities on a current basis and changes in the timing of the recognition of income or its character these 

changes any future regulatory guidance implementing the tcja as well as any other legislative or other proposals or changes relating to us taxation which may or may not be adopted and may apply on a prospective or retroactive basis could have a significant adverse effect on us and our affiliates 

adient may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the adient spinoff 

on october 31 2016 we completed the separation of our automotive experience business through the spinoff of adient plc to shareholders 

in connection with the spinoff of adient we and adient have entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a transitional trademark license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the spinoff we will rely on adient to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if adient is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties or losses 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

legislative action in the us could materially and adversely affect us 

legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes impose additional taxes on payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations such changes could have retroactive effect and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise incur business detriment 

legislation relating to governmental contracts could materially and adversely affect us 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

a judgment obtained against the combined company will be enforced by the courts of ireland if the following general requirements are met 

 

a judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending but where the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in ireland it remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive irish courts may also refuse to enforce a judgment of the us courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons 

 

as an irish company johnson controls is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of johnson controls international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

our effective tax rate may increase 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which if enacted could result in an increase in our effective tax rate additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material increase in our effective tax rate 

changes to the us model income tax treaty could adversely affect us 

on february 17 2016 the us treasury released a revised us model income tax convention the new model which is the baseline text used by the us treasury to negotiate tax treaties if any or all of the modifications to the model treaty are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and substantially increase our worldwide tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific modifications to the model treaty and we cannot provide assurance that any such modifications will not apply to us 

transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares there is no irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty is payable for certain share transfers a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to johnson controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases johnson controls may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty johnson controls memorandum and articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment johnson controls i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii may have a lien against the johnson controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in johnson controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by johnson controls 

dividends paid by us may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we will be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders shareholders that are resident in the us european union countries other than ireland or other countries with which ireland has signed a tax treaty whether the treaty has been ratified or not generally should not be subject to irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided its broker for onward transmission 

to our qualifying intermediary or other designated agent in the case of shares held beneficially or us or our transfer agent in the case of shares held directly with all the necessary documentation by the appropriate due date prior to payment of the dividend however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of johnson controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

johnson controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls

goodwill longlived assets and other investments 

goodwill at september 30 2019 was 182 billion 02 billion lower than the prior year the decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation 

goodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units which have been determined to be the company’s reportable segments or one level below the reportable segments in certain instances using a fair value method based on management’s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in estimating the fair value the company uses multiples of earnings based on the average of published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics and applies to the companys average of historical and future financial results in certain instances the company uses discounted cash flow analyses or estimated sales price to further support the fair value estimates the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc 820 fair value measurement the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 

the assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations the primary assumptions used in the impairment tests were managements projections of future cash flows although the companys cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unit 

indefinitelived other intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests 

while the company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the impairment tests are reasonable and no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived assets existed during fiscal years 2019  2018 and 2017  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and therefore impairment charges could be required which could be material to the consolidated financial statements 

the company reviews longlived assets including tangible assets and other intangible assets with definitive lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable the company conducts its longlived asset impairment analyses in accordance with asc 3601015 impairment or disposal of longlived assets asc 35030 general intangibles other than goodwill and asc 98520 costs of software to be sold leased or marketed asc 3601015 requires the company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows if the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals asc 35030 requires intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities to be considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated 

research and development efforts during the period that those assets are considered indefinite lived they shall not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an entity shall recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess asc 98520 requires the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product be compared to the net realizable value of that product the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product exceed the net realizable value of that asset shall be written off 

in fiscal 2019 the company concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain of its longlived assets in conjunction with the plans to dispose of a business within its global products segment that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale assets and liabilities held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell accordingly the company recorded an impairment charge of 235 million within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2019 to write down the carrying value of the assets held for sale to fair value less any costs to sell the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc 820 fair value measurement 

in fiscal 2018 the company concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain of its longlived assets in conjunction with its restructuring actions announced in fiscal 2018 as a result the company reviewed the longlived assets for impairment and recorded 36 million of asset impairment charges within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income of the total impairment charges 31 million related to the global products segment and 5 million related to corporate assets in addition the company recorded 6 million of asset impairments within discontinued operations related to the power solutions segment in fiscal 2018 refer to note 16 significant restructuring and impairment costs of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information the impairments were measured under a market approach utilizing an appraisal to determine fair values of the impaired assets this method is consistent with the methods the company employed in prior periods to value other longlived assets the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc 820 fair value measurement 

in fiscal 2017 the company concluded it had triggering events requiring assessment of impairment for certain of its longlived assets in conjunction with its restructuring actions announced in fiscal 2017 as a result the company reviewed the longlived assets for impairment and recorded 70 million of asset impairment charges within restructuring and impairment costs on the consolidated statements of income of the total impairment charges 30 million related to the building solutions north america segment 20 million related to the global products segment 19 million related to corporate assets and 1 million related to the building solutions asia pacific segment in addition the company recorded 7 million of asset impairments within discontinued operations related to the power solutions segment in fiscal 2017 refer to note 16 significant restructuring and impairment costs of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information the impairments were measured depending on the asset under either an income approach utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows or a market approach utilizing an appraisal to determine fair values of the impaired assets these methods are consistent with the methods the company employed in prior periods to value other longlived assets the inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc 820 fair value measurement

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures actual results could differ from those estimates the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue from certain longterm contracts to design manufacture and install building products and systems as well as unscheduled repair or replacement services on an over time basis with progress towards completion measured using a costtocost input method based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion the costtocost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the company incurs costs changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed monthly if contract modifications result in additional goods or services that are distinct from those transferred before the modification they are accounted for prospectively as if the company entered into a new contract if the goods or services in the modification are not distinct from those in the original contract sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catchup method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values estimated losses are recorded when identified the company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as at contract inception the company expects to receive the payment within twelve months of transfer of goods or services 

the company enters into extended warranties and longterm service and maintenance agreements with certain customers for these arrangements revenue is recognized over time on a straightline basis over the respective contract term

employee benefit plans 

the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement benefits plan assets and obligations are measured annually or more frequently if there is a significant remeasurement event based on the company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

the company utilizes a marktomarket approach for recognizing pension and postretirement benefit expenses including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event refer to note 15 retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the companys pension and postretirement benefit plans 

us gaap requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are overfunded us gaap also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan’s funded status as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year end 

the company considers the expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis when setting assumed discount rates as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for the us pension and postretirement plans the company uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds for the nonus pension and postretirement plans the company consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates the company’s weighted average discount rate on us pension plans was 295 and 410 at september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively the company’s weighted average discount rate on postretirement plans was 290 and 380 at september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively the company’s weighted average discount rate on nonus pension plans was 150 and 245 at september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets the company considers the historical returns on plan assets adjusted for forwardlooking considerations inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans’ invested assets reflecting the relatively longterm nature of the plans’ obligations approximately 28 of the plans’ assets are invested in equity securities and 59 in fixed income securities with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments for the years ending september 30 2019 and 2018  the company’s expected longterm return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 710 and 750 respectively the actual rate of return on us pension plans was above 710 in fiscal year 2019 and below 750 in fiscal year 2018  for the years ending september 30 2019 and 2018  the company’s weighted average expected longterm return on nonus pension plan assets was 520 and 535 respectively the actual rate of return on nonus pension plans was above 520 in fiscal year 2019 and below 535 in fiscal year 2018  for the years ending september 30 2019 and 2018  the company’s weighted average expected longterm return on postretirement plan assets was 565  the actual rate of return on postretirement plan assets was below 565 in fiscal year 2019 and 2018  

beginning in fiscal 2020  the company believes the longterm rate of return will approximate 690 520 and 570 for us pension nonus pension and postretirement plans respectively any differences between actual investment results and the expected longterm asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a significant remeasurement event if the company’s actual returns on plan assets are less than the company’s expectations additional contributions may be required 

in fiscal 2019  total employer contributions for continuing operations to the defined benefit pension plans were 50 million  none of which were voluntary contributions made by the company the company expects to contribute approximately 50 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2020  in fiscal 2019  total employer contributions for continuing operations to the postretirement plans were 3 million  the company expects to contribute approximately 4 million in cash to its postretirement plans in fiscal 2020

the company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered along with any other positive or negative evidence since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowances may be necessary at september 30 2019  the company had a valuation allowance of 51 billion for continuing operations of which 45 billion relates to net operating loss carryforwards primarily in australia brazil france germany ireland luxembourg spain switzerland united kingdom and the us for which sustainable taxable income has not been demonstrated and 600 million for other deferred tax assets 

the company’s federal income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the irs and respective nonus tax authorities although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at september 30 2019  the company had recorded a liability of 25 billion for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

risk management 

the company selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency commodities and stockbased compensation all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes at the inception of the hedge the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either 1 a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of a recognized firm commitment a fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a nonus operation a net investment hedge the company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used all other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging are revalued in the consolidated statements of income 

for all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test the fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated the hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 for commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges effectiveness is tested using a regression calculation ineffectiveness is minimal as the company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts 

for net investment hedges the company assesses its net investment positions in the nonus operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis the hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a nonus operation does not exceed the company’s net investment positions in the respective nonus operation 

equity swaps and any other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 require no assessment of effectiveness 

a discussion of the company’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities and note 11 fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange 

the company has manufacturing sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies in order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the company’s global diversification foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are as appropriate hedged with financial instruments 

the company hedges 70 to 90 of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures the company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items the company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 

the company has entered into foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income aoci account within shareholders’ equity attributable to johnson controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the company’s net investm ents globally 

at september 30 2019 and 2018  the company estimates that an unfavorable 10 change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately 358 million and 212 million respectively 

interest rates 

substantially all of the companys outstanding debt has fixed interest rates a 10 increase in the average cost of the company’s variable rate debt would have had an immaterial impact on pretax interest expense for the year ended september 30 2019 and an unfavorable impact of approximately 5 million for the year ended september 30 2018  

commodities 

the company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines as a cash flow hedge gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business the maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities 

environmental health and safety and other matters 

the company’s global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws under various circumstances these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material

backlog 

the company’s backlog relating to the building technologies  solutions business is applicable to its sales of systems and services at september 30 2018  the backlog was 87 billion of which 84 billion is attributable to the field business the majority of backlog relates to fiscal 2019 at september 30 2017  the backlog was 85 billion of which 82 billion is attributable to the field business the backlog amount outstanding at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year 

raw materials 

raw materials used by the businesses in connection with their operations including lead steel tin aluminum urethane chemicals brass copper sulfuric acid polypropylene and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression agents were readily available during fiscal 2018  and the company expects such availability to continue in fiscal 2019 commodity prices could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the results of operations 

intellectual property 

generally the company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by contracts licenses confidentiality or other agreements 

the company owns numerous us and nonus patents and their respective counterparts the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products while the company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset no single patent or group of patents is critical to the success of the business the company from time to time grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others 

the company’s trademarks certain of which are material to its business are registered or otherwise legally protected in the us and many nonus countries where products and services of the company are sold the company from time to time becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions

environmental health and safety matters 

laws addressing the protection of the environment environmental laws and workers’ safety and health worker safety laws govern the company’s ongoing global operations they generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where companyrelated materials have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the company’s businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances 

the company’s operations and facilities have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties see item 3 legal proceedings of this report for a discussion of the company’s potential environmental liabilities 

environmental capital expenditures 

the company’s ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions however expenditures in fiscal 2018  related solely to environmental compliance were not material it is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year 

government regulation and supervision 

the companys operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the us in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states and nonus jurisdictions in which the company operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries the companys security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals wireline and wireless telephone companies in the us are regulated by the federal and state governments in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact the companys fire businesses these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the company conducts its business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect the companys worldwide operations both favorably and unfavorably for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the companys business see item 1a risk factors

risk factors 

tableend 

risks relating to business operations 

general economic credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to grow or sustain our businesses and our ability to access the capital markets 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets global economic conditions affect each of our primary businesses as we discuss in greater detail in the specific risk factors for each of our businesses that appear below any future financial distress in the industries andor markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods result in future restructuring charges and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our businesses 

the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide a worldwide economic downturn andor disruption of the credit markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings prevailing industry conditions the volatility of the capital markets or other factors then our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

much of the demand for installation of hvac security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit commercial and residential real estate markets are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values could lead to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors could in turn temper demand for new hvac fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally 

volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could significantly raise the cost of new debt for our customers any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

decreased demand from our customers in the automotive industry may adversely affect our results of operations 

our financial performance in the power solutions business depends in part on conditions in the automotive industry sales to oems accounted for approximately 25 of the total sales of the power solutions business in fiscal 2018 declines in the north american european and asian automotive production levels could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any oems reach a point where they cannot fund their operations we may incur writeoffs of accounts receivable incur impairment charges or require additional restructuring actions beyond our current restructuring plans which if significant would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

an inability to successfully respond to competition and pricing pressure from other companies in the power solutions business may adversely impact our business 

our power solutions business competes with a number of major us and nonus manufacturers and distributors of leadacid batteries as well as a large number of smaller regional competitors the north american european and asian leadacid battery markets are highly competitive the manufacturers in these markets compete on price quality technical innovation service and warranty if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain market share in the regions and markets we serve our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 

increases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed therefore in the shortterm we cannot adjust for changes in certain commodity prices in these cases if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply based fixed price contracts we use commodity hedge contracts to minimize overall price risk associated with our anticipated commodity purchases unfavorability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level additionally to the extent we do not or are unable to hedge certain commodities and the commodity prices substantially increase such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in our power solutions business lead is a major component of leadacid batteries and the price of lead may be highly volatile we attempt to manage the impact of changing lead prices through the recycling of used batteries returned to us by our aftermarket customers commercial terms and commodity hedging programs our ability to mitigate the impact of lead price changes can be impacted by many factors including customer negotiations inventory level fluctuations and sales volumemix changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business 

unlike many of our competitors the company relies on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue the direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions and hvac equipment manufactured by the company this represents a significant distribution channel for our products creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and hvac equipment and creates opportunities for longer term service and monitoring revenue if we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business whether due to changes in economic conditions a failure to anticipate changing customer needs a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions or for any other reason our installation revenue could decline which could in turn adversely impact our product pull through and our ability to grow service and monitoring revenue 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive and increasingly complex products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products and services requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance the potential for product defects product quality issues or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with our nonus operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the us some of which are located in emerging markets longterm economic uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which we operate such as asia south america the middle east europe and emerging markets could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements 

in addition as a result of our global presence a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period 

there are other risks that are inherent in our nonus operations including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions laws and regulations including antitrust import export labor and environmental laws and monetary and fiscal policies protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures or impact trade volumes unsettled political conditions governmentimposed plant or other operational shutdowns backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions corruption natural and manmade disasters hazards and losses violence civil and labor unrest and possible terrorist attacks 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our nonus operations and therefore on our business and results of operations 

our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws codes and standards and similar foreign laws codes standards and regulations changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to 

comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses competition or other regulatory investigations can continue for several years be costly to defend and can result in substantial fines if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls antitrust customs data privacy restrictions currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets and laws governing certain materials that may be in our products no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations for example some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the us and continue to evolve in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr superseded prior european union data protection legislation and it imposes more stringent european union data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance under the gdpr fines of up to 20 million euro or up to 4 of the annual global turnover of the infringer whichever is greater could be imposed further existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement or any successor agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials either directly or through our suppliers could have an impact on our competitive position business and financial results for example certain of our businesses have a significant presence in the united kingdom the “uk” where the success of the brexit referendum in 2016 has continued to cause political and economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the full terms of the uk’s future relationship with the european union will be it is possible that the uk may be at risk of losing access to free trade agreements for goods and services with the eu and other countries which may result in increased tariffs on uk imports and exports that could have an adverse effect on our profitability 

we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws around the world 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with antibribery laws we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we could be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of such compliance matters or we could be subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the us government 

our customers include many us federal state and local government authorities doing business with the us government and state and local authorities subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for failure to perform under the applicable contract we are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations in addition various us federal and 

state legislative proposals have been made in the past that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of trademarks trade secrets patents copyrights knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming and the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

global climate change could negatively affect our business 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives that if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings and batteries for energy efficient vehicles and could increase costs of compliance these factors may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

there is a growing consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to global climate changes climate changes such as extreme weather conditions create financial risk to our business for example the demand for our products and services such as residential air conditioning equipment and automotive replacement batteries may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions climate changes could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks the company could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and process disruptions due to physical climate changes could result in price modifications for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

we have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties these projects relate to a variety of activities including solvent oil metal lead perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable future expenses that we may incur to remediate identified sites could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters including those related to the manufacturing and recycling of leadacid batteries which could adversely affect our business results of operation and reputation 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other things solid and hazardous waste storage treatment and disposal and remediation of releases of hazardous materials including as it pertains to lead the primary material used in the manufacture of leadacid batteries there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials 

federal state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters including but not limited to health safety and permitting in addition to the environmental matters discussed above new legislation and regulations may require the company to make material changes to its operations resulting in significant increases to the cost of production 

we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the amounts we have recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets in the consolidated statements of financial position are based on our current strategy for resolving asbestos claims currently available information and a number of variables estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants and the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in our calculations vary significantly from actual results if actual liabilities are significantly higher than those recorded the cost of resolving such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets discount rates mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods because we marktomarket our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis large noncash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when a remeasurement event occurs generally accepted accounting principles in the us require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon among other factors interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost refer to critical accounting estimates and policies included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions which could adversely affect our profitability and operations 

to align our resources with our growth strategies operate more efficiently and control costs we periodically announce restructuring plans which may include workforce reductions global plant closures and consolidations asset impairments and other cost reduction 

initiatives we may undertake additional restructuring actions and workforce reductions in the future as these plans and actions are complex unforeseen factors could result in expected savings and benefits to be delayed or not realized to the full extent planned and our operations and business may be disrupted 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the reversal of outside basis differences that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows additionally changes in tax laws in the us ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

future changes in us tax law could adversely affect us or our affiliates 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law a bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja which made significant changes to certain us tax laws relevant to us and our affiliates while the provisions of the tcja are new their interpretation is subject to uncertainty and regulatory guidance on many aspects of the tcja has not yet been issued the tjca is expected to have an adverse effect on the us federal income taxation of our and our affiliates’ operations including limiting or eliminating various deductions or credits including interest expense deductions and deductions relating to employee compensation imposing taxes on certain crossborder payments or transfers imposing taxes on certain earnings of nonus entities on a current basis changing the timing of the recognition of income or its character limiting asset basis under certain circumstances and imposing additional corporate taxes under certain circumstances to combat perceived base erosion issues among other changes 

the tcja and any related legislation or regulations as well as any other future changes in us tax laws could adversely affect the us federal income taxation of our and our affiliates’ ongoing operations and may also adversely affect the integration efforts relating to and potential synergies from past strategic transactions as described below any such changes and related consequences could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows see note 18 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact the tcja had on our business financial performance and results of operations 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims we have also been named as a defendant in a number of actions where third party use of our products has allegedly resulted in contamination to groundwater and drinking water supplies plaintiffs in these cases are generally seeking damages for personal injuries medical monitoring and diminution in property values and are also seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief to address remediation of the alleged contamination there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows that is greater than we anticipate andor negatively affect our reputation see “item 3 legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k a further discussion of these matters 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt historically we have relied on our ability to issue commercial paper rather than to draw on our credit facility to support our daily operations which means that a downgrade in our ratings or volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 

additionally several of our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be unable to complete or integrate acquisitions or joint ventures effectively which may adversely affect our growth profitability and results of operations 

we expect acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as joint ventures or other strategic arrangements to play a role in our future growth we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses additionally we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses or joint ventures into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies which could result in impairment of assets including goodwill and acquired intangible assets given the significance of the companys recent acquisitions the goodwill and intangible assets recorded were significant and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions if we were to use equity securities to finance a future acquisition our thencurrent shareholders would experience dilution we are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior these and other factors related to acquisitions and joint ventures may negatively and adversely impact our growth profitability and results of operations 

risks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future our joint venture partners may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture in addition we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships our joint venture arrangements may require us among other matters to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner’s consent to take certain actions in addition our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain administrative functions 

we have been regionally centralizing certain administrative functions primarily in north america europe and asia to improve efficiency and reduce costs to the extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled key business processes such as invoicing payments and general management operations could be interrupted which could have an adverse impact on our business 

a failure of our information technology it and data security infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems or integrate existing systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system or a security breach of our it systems including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business 

we and certain of our thirdparty vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business including our buildings controls business and our fire and security business despite our 

implementation of security measures our it systems like those of other companies are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyber attack and other similar disruptions any system failure accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations or those of our customers a material network breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property trade secrets customer information human resources information or other confidential matter or the theft of the confidential information of our customers to the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our or our customers data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential proprietary or customer information it could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan organizational and reporting changes resulting from the merger or as a result of any future leadership transition or corporate initiatives could result in increased turnover additionally any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 122000  people worldwide approximately 26 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works council other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure in our fire and security businesses than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because many of our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our installation service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances and we typically maintain product liability insurance to mitigate the risk that our products and services fail to operate as expected however in the event of litigation it is possible that contract limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable that our insurance coverage is not adequate or that insurance 

carriers deny coverage of our claims as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we do not own the right to use the adt® brand name in the us and canada 

we own the adt® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the us and canada and the adt corporation adt owns the brand name in the us and canada although tyco has entered agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt® brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the us and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the us and canada any of these factors may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies 

police departments in a limited number of jurisdictions do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance we have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies in most cases through contracts with us which increases the overall cost to customers if more police departments whether inside or outside the us were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our power solutions business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our power solutions business loss of or changes in automobile battery supply contracts with our large original equipment and aftermarket customers the increasing quality and useful life of batteries or use of alternative battery technologies both of which may adversely impact the leadacid battery market including replacement cycle delays or cancellations of new vehicle programs market and financial consequences of any recalls that may be required on our products delays or difficulties in new product development including lithiumion technology impact of potential increases in lithiumion battery volumes on established leadacid battery volumes as lithiumion battery technology grows and costs become more competitive financial instability or market declines of our customers or suppliers slower than projected market development in emerging markets interruption of supply of certain singlesource components changing nature of our joint ventures and relationships with our strategic business partners unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world our ability to secure sufficient tolling capacity to recycle batteries price and availability of battery cores used in recycling and the pace of the development of the market for hybrid and electric vehicles 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our buildings business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our buildings business loss of changes in or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers cancellation of or significant delays in projects in our backlog delays or difficulties in new product development the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies financial instability or market declines of our major component suppliers the unavailability of raw materials primarily steel copper and electronic components necessary for production of our products price increases of limitedsource components products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems revisions to energy efficiency or refrigerant legislation and natural or manmade disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers 

risks relating to strategic transactions 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination between johnson controls inc and tyco international plc 

the success of the merger will depend on among other things our ability to combine the legacy businesses of johnson controls and tyco in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by us we expect to benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and branch optimization as well as greater tax efficiencies from global management and global cash movement we may also enjoy revenue synergies including product and service crossselling a more diversified and expanded product offering and balance across geographic regions however we must successfully combine the legacy businesses of johnson controls and tyco in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized in 

addition we must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives we may not realize fully or at all the anticipated benefits of the merger or it may take longer to realize the benefits than expected 

other factors may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger or impact our future performance these include among other items the possibility that the contingent liabilities of either party including contingent tax liabilities are larger than expected the existence of unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger and possible adverse tax consequences pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws including most recently the tcja regulations or other administrative guidance in addition we may be subject to additional restrictions resulting from tyco’s incurrence of debt in connection with the merger and as a result of the companys irish domicile 

we may encounter significant difficulties in combining the legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses 

the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to combining the business practices and operations of the legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses this process may disrupt the businesses the failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect our results of operations the overall combination of legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

• the diversion of management attention to integration matters 

• difficulties in integrating operations and systems 

• challenges in conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and 

compensation structures between the two companies 

• difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel 

• challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers 

• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from the 

combination 

• difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company 

• contingent liabilities including contingent tax liabilities that are larger than expected and 

• potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger 

including possible adverse tax consequences to the combined company pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws or 

regulations 

many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company 

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines for example on october 31 2016 we completed the spinoff of our automotive experience business and sold our scott safety business in october 2017 in addition on november 13 2018 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our power solutions business to bcp acquisitions llc divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business some divestitures like the power solutions divestiture may be dilutive to earnings in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may also result in a diversion of management attention operational difficulties and losses with respect to the power solutions divestiture there can be no assurance whether and when the required regulatory approvals for the divestiture will be obtained whether and when the closing conditions will be satisfied or waived and whether the strategic benefits and expected financial impact of the divestiture will be achieved 

the internal revenue service irs may not agree that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes and may not agree that the our us affiliates should not be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules 

under current us federal tax law a corporation is generally considered for us federal tax purposes to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation because johnson controls international plc is an irish incorporated entity it would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules however section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under section 7874 if 1 former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 80 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding johnson controls inc common stock the 80 ownership test and such ownership percentage the section 7874 ownership percentage and 2 our expanded affiliated group did not have substantial business activities in ireland the substantial business activities test we will be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes if the section 7874 ownership percentage of the former johnson controls inc shareholders after the merger was less than 80 but at least 60 the 60 ownership test and the substantial business activities test was not met we and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco may in some circumstances be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules which among other things could limit their ability to utilize certain us tax attributes to offset us taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions 

based on the terms of the merger the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 and certain factual assumptions we believe that former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 less than 60 by both vote and value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding shares of johnson controls inc common stock therefore under current law we believe that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 should otherwise not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the merger 

however the rules under section 7874 are complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application in particular ownership for purposes of section 7874 is subject to various adjustments under the code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and there is limited guidance regarding section 7874 including with respect to the application of the ownership tests described therein as a result the determination of the section 7874 ownership percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties thus there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger 

in addition on january 13 2017 and july 11 2018 the us treasury and the irs finalized certain treasury regulations issued under section 7874 and revised certain related temporary regulations the section 7874 regulations which among other things require certain adjustments that generally increase for purposes of the section 7874 ownership tests the percentage of the stock of a foreign acquiring corporation deemed owned within the meaning of section 7874 by the former shareholders of an acquired us corporation by reason of holding stock in such us corporation for example these regulations disregard for purposes of determining this ownership percentage 1 any nonordinary course distributions within the meaning of the regulations made by the acquired us corporation such as johnson controls inc during the 36 months preceding the acquisition including certain dividends and share repurchases 2 potentially any cash consideration received by the shareholders of such us corporation in the acquisition to the extent such cash is directly or indirectly provided by the us corporation as well as 3 certain stock of the foreign acquiring corporation that was issued as consideration in a prior acquisition of another us corporation or us partnership during the 36 months preceding the signing date of a binding contract for the acquisition being tested taking into account the effect of these regulations we believe that the section 7874 ownership percentage of former johnson controls inc shareholders in us was less than 60 however these regulations are complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully assert that either the 80 ownership test or the 60 ownership test was met after the merger 

if the 80 ownership test was met after the merger and we were accordingly treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we would be subject to substantial additional us tax liability additionally in such case our nonus shareholders would be subject to us withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we pay to such shareholders subject to an exemption or reduced rate available under an applicable tax treaty regardless of any application of section 7874 we are treated as an irish tax resident for irish tax purposes consequently if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and irish taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if the 60 ownership test were met several adverse us federal income tax rules could apply to our us affiliates in particular in such case section 7874 could limit the ability of such us affiliates to utilize certain us tax attributes including net operating losses and certain tax credits to offset any taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions including any transfers or licenses of property to a foreign related person during the 10year period following the merger the section 7874 regulations generally expand the scope of these rules if the 60 ownership test were met after the merger such current and future limitations would apply to our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco and their application could limit their ability to utilize such us tax attributes against any income or gain recognized in connection with the adient spinoff in such case the application of such rules could result in significant additional us tax liability in addition the section 7874 regulations and certain related temporary regulations issued under other provisions of the code include rules that would apply if the 60 ownership test were met which in such situation may limit our ability to restructure or access cash earned by certain of our nonus subsidiaries in each case without incurring substantial us tax liabilities 

future potential changes to the tax laws could result in our being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or in us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco being subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules 

as discussed above under current law we believe that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger however changes to section 7874 or the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes or could result in the application of certain adverse us federal income tax rules to us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application and may apply even though the merger has been consummated if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes or if we or our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco were to become subject to such adverse us federal income tax rules we and our us affiliates could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated 

certain legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of us corporate tax residence including in such a way as would cause us to be treated as a us corporation if our place of management and control or the place of management and control of our nonus affiliates were determined to be located primarily in the united states in addition certain legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of section 7874 or otherwise address certain perceived issues arising in connection with socalled inversion transactions for example multiple proposals introduced by certain democratic members of both houses of congress which if enacted in their present form would be effective retroactively to certain transactions including the merger would among other things treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 if the former shareholders of a us corporation acquired by such foreign acquiring corporation own more than 50 of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition these proposals if enacted in their present form and made retroactive to a date before the date of the closing of the merger would cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes in such case we would be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated it is presently uncertain whether any such proposals or other legislative action relating to the scope of us tax residence section 7874 or socalled inversion transactions and inverted groups will be enacted into law 

other legislative andor other proposals relating to us taxation could also have a material impact on our future financial results the recently enacted tcja introduced significant changes to certain us tax laws relevant to us and our affiliates including limitations on the deductibility of certain interest expense and employee compensation limitations on various other deductions and credits the imposition of taxes in respect of certain crossborder payments or transfers the imposition of taxes on certain earnings of nonus entities on a current basis and changes in the timing of the recognition of income or its character these changes any future regulatory guidance implementing the tcja as well as any other legislative or other proposals or changes relating to us taxation which may or may not be adopted and may apply on a prospective or retroactive basis could have a significant adverse effect on us and our affiliates 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff of adient plc 

on october 31 2016 we completed the separation of our automotive experience business through the spinoff of adient plc to shareholders following the spinoff we are a smaller and less diversified company with a narrower business focus and as a result we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions 

although we believe that the spinoff of adient plc will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and shareholders the spinoff may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits in addition we have and will continue to incur onetime costs and ongoing costs in connection with or as a result of the spinoff including costs of operating as independent publiclytraded companies that the two businesses are no longer able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not 

realize the intended benefits of the spinoff or if our costs exceed our estimates we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

adient may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the adient spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff of adient we and adient have entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a transitional trademark license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the spinoff we will rely on adient to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if adient is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties or losses 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

legislative action in the us could materially and adversely affect us 

legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes impose additional taxes on payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations such changes could have retroactive effect and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise incur business detriment 

legislation relating to governmental contracts could materially and adversely affect us 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

a judgment obtained against the combined company will be enforced by the courts of ireland if the following general requirements are met 

 

a judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending but where the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in ireland it remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive irish courts may also refuse to enforce a judgment of the us courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons 



 

as an irish company johnson controls is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of johnson controls international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

our effective tax rate may increase 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate which if enacted could result in an increase in our effective tax rate additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material increase in our effective tax rate 

changes to the us model income tax treaty could adversely affect us 

on february 17 2016 the us treasury released a revised us model income tax convention the new model which is the baseline text used by the us treasury to negotiate tax treaties the new model treaty provisions were preceded by draft versions released by the us treasury on may 20 2015 the may 2015 draft for public comment the revisions made to the model address certain aspects of the model by modifying existing provisions and introducing entirely new provisions specifically the new provisions target i permanent establishments subject to little or no foreign tax ii special tax regimes iii expatriated entities subject to section 7874 iv the antitreaty shopping measures of the limitation on benefits article and v subsequent changes in treaty partners tax laws 

with respect to new model provisions pertaining to expatriated entities because we do not believe that the merger resulted in the creation of an expatriated entity as defined in section 7874 payments of interest dividends royalties and certain other items of income by or to us andor our us affiliates to or from nonus persons would not be expected to become subject to full withholding tax even if applicable treaties were subsequently amended to adopt the new model provisions in response to comments the us treasury received regarding the may 2015 draft the new model treaty provisions pertaining to expatriated entities fix the definition of expatriated entity to the meaning ascribed to such term under section 7874a2a as of the date the relevant bilateral treaty is signed however as discussed above the rules under section 7874 are relatively new complex and are the subject of current and future legislative and regulatory changes accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that the merger did not result in the creation of an expatriated entity within the meaning of section 7874 under the law as in effect at the time the applicable treaty were to be amended or that such a challenge would not be sustained by a court or that such position would not be affected by future or regulatory action which may apply retroactively to the merger 

transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares there is no irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty is payable for certain share transfers a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to johnson controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases johnson controls may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty johnson controls memorandum and articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment johnson controls i may seek reimbursement from 

the buyer ii may have a lien against the johnson controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in johnson controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by johnson controls 

dividends paid by us may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we will be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders shareholders that are resident in the us european union countries other than ireland or other countries with which ireland has signed a tax treaty whether the treaty has been ratified or not generally should not be subject to irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided its broker for onward transmission to our qualifying intermediary or other designated agent in the case of shares held beneficially or us or our transfer agent in the case of shares held directly with all the necessary documentation by the appropriate due date prior to payment of the dividend however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of johnson controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

johnson controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls

income tax provision 



the statutory tax rate in ireland is being used as a comparison since the company is domiciled in ireland the effective rate is above the statutory rate of 125 for fiscal 2018 primarily due to the discrete net impacts of us tax reform final income tax effects of the completed divestiture of the scott safety business legal entity restructuring associated with the power solutions business valuation allowance adjustments and tax rate differentials partially offset by the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives tax audit closures and tax benefits due to changes in entity tax status the effective rate is above the statutory rate of 125 for fiscal 2017 primarily due to the establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the companys investment in certain subsidiaries related to the divestiture of the scott safety business the income tax effects of pension marktomarket gains and tax rate differentials partially offset by the jurisdictional mix of significant restructuring and impairment costs tyco merger transaction and integration costs purchase accounting adjustments tax audit closures a tax benefit due to changes in entity tax status and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives the fiscal 2018 effective tax rate decreased as compared to the fiscal 2017 effective tax rate primarily due to discrete tax items and tax planning initiatives the fiscal year 2018 and 2017 global tax planning initiatives related primarily to foreign tax credit planning changes in entity tax status global financing structures and alignment of the companys global business functions in a tax efficient manner refer to note 18 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the company performed an analysis related to the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets as a result and after considering feasible tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence the company determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily within germany would not be realized therefore the company recorded 56 million of valuation allowances as income tax expense in the three month period ended september 30 2018

uncertain tax positions 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of the company’s business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities 

during fiscal 2018 the company settled tax examinations impacting fiscal years 2010 to fiscal 2012 which resulted in a 25 million net benefit to income tax expense 

during fiscal 2017 the company settled a significant number of tax examinations impacting fiscal years 2006 to fiscal 2014 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 income tax audit resolutions resulted in a net 191 million benefit to income tax expense 

the company’s federal income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the irs and respective nonus tax authorities although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain 

management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at september 30 2018 the company had recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

impacts of tax legislation and change in statutory tax rates 

on december 22 2017 the “tax cuts and jobs act” hr 1 was enacted and significantly revises us corporate income tax by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates imposing a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries and implementing a territorial tax system and various base erosion minimum tax provisions 

in connection with the company’s analysis of the impact of the us tax law changes which is provisional and subject to change the company recorded a net tax charge of 108 million during fiscal 2018 this provisional net tax charge arises from a benefit of 108 million due to the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities offset by the company’s tax charge relating to the onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings inclusive of all relevant taxes of 216 million the company’s estimated benefit of the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities increased from 101 million as of december 31 2017 to 108 million as of september 30 2018 due to calculation refinement of the company’s estimated impact the company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future the company’s tax charge for transition tax decreased from 305 million as of december 31 2017 to 216 million as of september 30 2018 due to further analysis of the company’s post1986 nonus earnings and profits “ep” previously deferred from us federal taxation and refinement of the estimated impact of tax law changes 

based on the effective dates of certain aspects of the us tax law changes various applicable impacts of the enacted legislation could not be finalized as of september 30 2018 while the company made reasonable estimates of the impact of the transition tax the final impact of the us tax law changes may differ from these estimated impacts due to future treasury regulations tax 

law technical corrections notices rulings refined computations and other items the company will finalize such provisional amounts within the time period prescribed by staff accounting bulletin 118 

during the fiscal years ended 2018 and 2017 other tax legislation was adopted in various jurisdictions these law changes did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements

the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market risk associated with changes in interest rates for its fixedrate bonds at september 30 2018  the company did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps the company assesses retrospective and prospective effectiveness and records any measured ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of income on a monthly basis 

equity swaps and any other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 require no assessment of effectiveness 

a discussion of the company’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities and note 11 fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange 

the company has manufacturing sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies in order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the company’s global diversification foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are as appropriate hedged with financial instruments 

the company hedges 70 to 90 of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures the company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items the company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 

the company has entered into foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income aoci account within shareholders’   equity attributable to johnson controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the company’s net investm ents globally 

at september 30 2018  and 2017  the company estimates that an unfavorable 10 change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately 212 million and 330 million respectively 

interest rates 

from time to time the company may use interest rate swaps to offset its exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with asc 815 these outstanding swaps qualify and are designated as fair value hedges the company had no outstanding interest rate swaps at september 30 2018  and 2017 respectively a 10 increase in the average cost of the company’s variable rate debt would have resulted in an unfavorable change in pretax interest expense of approximately 5 million and 13 million for the year ended september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively 

commodities 

the company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines as a cash flow hedge gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business the maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities 

environmental health and safety and other matters 

the company’s global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws under various circumstances these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material

risk factors 

tableend 

risks relating to business operations 

general economic credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to grow or sustain our businesses and our ability to access the capital markets 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets global economic conditions affect each of our primary businesses as we discuss in greater detail in the specific risk factors for each of our businesses that appear below any future financial distress in the industries andor markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods result in future restructuring charges and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our businesses 

the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide a worldwide economic downturn andor disruption of the credit markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings prevailing industry conditions the volatility of the capital markets or other factors then our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

much of the demand for installation of hvac security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit commercial and residential real estate markets are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values could lead to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors could in turn hamper demand for new hvac fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could significantly raise the cost of new debt for our customers any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

decreased demand from our customers in the automotive industry may adversely affect our results of operations 

our financial performance in the power solutions business depends in part on conditions in the automotive industry sales to oems accounted for approximately 24 of the total sales of the power solutions business in fiscal 2017 declines in the north american european and asian automotive production levels could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any oems reach a point where they cannot fund their operations we may incur writeoffs of accounts receivable incur impairment charges or require additional restructuring actions beyond our current restructuring plans which if significant would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

an inability to successfully respond to competition and pricing pressure from other companies in the power solutions business may adversely impact our business 

our power solutions business competes with a number of major us and nonus manufacturers and distributors of leadacid batteries as well as a large number of smaller regional competitors the north american european and asian leadacid battery markets are highly competitive the manufacturers in these markets compete on price quality technical innovation service and warranty if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain market share in the regions and markets we serve our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 

increases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed therefore in the shortterm we cannot adjust for changes in certain commodity prices in these cases if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply based fixed price contracts we use commodity hedge contracts to minimize overall price risk associated with our anticipated commodity purchases unfavorability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level additionally to the extent we do not or are unable to hedge certain commodities and the commodity prices substantially increase such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in our power solutions business lead is a major component of leadacid batteries and the price of lead may be highly volatile we attempt to manage the impact of changing lead prices through the recycling of used batteries returned to us by our aftermarket customers commercial terms and commodity hedging programs our ability to mitigate the impact of lead price changes can be impacted by many factors including customer negotiations inventory level fluctuations and sales volumemix changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business 

unlike many of our competitors the company relies on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue the direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions and hvac equipment manufactured by the company this represents a significant distribution channel for our products creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and hvac equipment and creates opportunities for longer term service and monitoring revenue if we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business whether due to changes in economic conditions a failure to anticipate changing customer needs a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions or for any other reason our installation revenue could decline which could in turn adversely impact our product pull through and our ability to grow service and monitoring revenue 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive and increasingly complex products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products and services requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance the potential for product defects product quality issues or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with our nonus operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the us some of which are located in emerging markets longterm economic uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which we operate such as asia south america the middle east europe and emerging markets could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements 

in addition as a result of our global presence a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period 

there are other risks that are inherent in our nonus operations including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions laws and regulations including antitrust import export labor and environmental laws and monetary and fiscal policies protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures or impact trade volumes unsettled political conditions governmentimposed plant or other operational shutdowns backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions corruption natural and manmade disasters hazards and losses violence civil and labor unrest and possible terrorist attacks 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our nonus operations and therefore on our business and results of operations 

our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws codes and standards and similar foreign laws codes standards and regulations changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses for example we were subject to investigation by the european commission related to european lead recyclers’ procurement practices from 2012 to 2017 although we were not fined in connection with such investigation competition or other regulatory investigations can continue for several years be costly to defend and can result in substantial fines if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls antitrust customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations and laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws around the world 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with antibribery laws we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition in addition we could be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of such compliance matters or we could be subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the us government 

our customers include many us federal state and local government authorities doing business with the us government and state and local authorities subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for failure to 

perform under the applicable contract we are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations in addition various us federal and state legislative proposals have been made that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of trademarks trade secrets patents copyrights knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming and the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

global climate change could negatively affect our business 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives that if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings and batteries for energy efficient vehicles and could increase costs of compliance these factors may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

there is a growing consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to global climate changes climate changes such as extreme weather conditions create financial risk to our business for example the demand for our products and services such as residential air conditioning equipment and automotive replacement batteries may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions climate changes could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks the company could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and process disruptions due to physical climate changes could result in price modifications for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

we have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties these projects relate to a variety of activities including solvent oil metal lead and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable future expenses that we may 

incur to remediate identified sites could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters including those related to the manufacturing and recycling of leadacid batteries which could adversely affect our business results of operation and reputation 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other things solid and hazardous waste storage treatment and disposal and remediation of releases of hazardous materials including as it pertains to lead the primary material used in the manufacture of leadacid batteries there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials 

federal state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters including but not limited to health safety and permitting in addition to the environmental matters discussed above new legislation and regulations may require the company to make material changes to its operations resulting in significant increases to the cost of production 

we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the amounts we have recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets in the consolidated statements of financial position are based on our current strategy for resolving asbestos claims currently available information and a number of variables estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants and the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in our calculations vary significantly from actual results if actual liabilities are significantly higher than those recorded the cost of resolving such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

risks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets discount rates mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods because we marktomarket our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis large noncash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when a remeasurement event occurs generally accepted accounting principles in the us require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon among other factors interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost refer to critical accounting estimates and policies included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions which could adversely affect our profitability and operations 

to align our resources with our growth strategies operate more efficiently and control costs we periodically announce restructuring plans which may include workforce reductions global plant closures and consolidations asset impairments and other cost reduction initiatives we may undertake additional restructuring actions and workforce reductions in the future as these plans and actions are complex unforeseen factors could result in expected savings and benefits to be delayed or not realized to the full extent planned and our operations and business may be disrupted 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations additionally changes in tax laws in the us ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

future changes in us tax law could adversely affect us or our affiliates 

in november 2017 a bill entitled the tax cuts and jobs act was introduced before the us house of representatives together with amendments and with markups produced by committees of the us house of representatives and the us senate the tcja if enacted in its present form the tcja could have a significant adverse effect on the us federal income taxation of our and our affiliates’ operations including by limiting or eliminating various deductions or credits including interest expense deductions and deductions relating to employee compensation imposing taxes on certain crossborder payments or transfers imposing taxes on certain earnings of nonus entities on a current basis changing the timing of the recognition of income or its character limiting asset basis under certain circumstances and imposing additional corporate taxes under certain circumstances to combat perceived base erosion issues among other changes 

the tcja is subject to ongoing discussion and amendment and may or may not be enacted in its current form or with retroactive or prospective effect the tcja or any related similar or amended legislation or other changes in us federal income tax laws could adversely affect the us federal income taxation of our and our affiliates’ ongoing operations and may also adversely affect the integration efforts relating to and potential synergies from past strategic transactions as described below any such changes and related consequences could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims we have also been named as a defendant in a number of actions where third party use of our products has allegedly resulted in contamination to groundwater and drinking water supplies plaintiffs in these cases are generally seeking damages for personal injuries medical monitoring and diminution in property values and are also seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief to address remediation of the alleged contamination there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our results of operations that is greater than we anticipate andor negatively affect our reputation see “item 3 legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k a further discussion of these matters 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt historically we have relied on our ability to issue commercial paper rather than to draw on our credit 

facility to support our daily operations which means that a downgrade in our ratings or volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 

additionally several of our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be unable to complete or integrate acquisitions or joint ventures effectively which may adversely affect our growth profitability and results of operations 

we expect acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as joint ventures or other strategic arrangements to play a role in our future growth we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses additionally we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses or joint ventures into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies which could result in impairment of assets including goodwill and acquired intangible assets given the significance of the companys recent acquisitions the goodwill and intangible assets recorded were significant and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions if we were to use equity securities to finance a future acquisition our thencurrent shareholders would experience dilution we are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior these and other factors related to acquisitions and joint ventures may negatively and adversely impact our growth profitability and results of operations 

risks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future our joint venture partners may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture in addition we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships our joint venture arrangements may require us among other matters to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner’s consent to take certain actions in addition our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain administrative functions 

we have been regionally centralizing certain administrative functions primarily in north america europe and asia to improve efficiency and reduce costs to the extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled key business processes such as invoicing payments and general management operations could be interrupted which could have an adverse impact on our business 

a failure of our information technology it and data security infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems or integrate existing systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system or a security breach of our it systems including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business 

we and certain of our thirdparty vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business despite our implementation of security measures our it systems like those of other companies are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyber attack and other similar disruptions any system failure accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations a material network breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property trade secrets customer information human resources information or other confidential matter to the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential proprietary or customer information it could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan organizational and reporting changes resulting from the merger or as a result of any future leadership transition or corporate initiatives could result in increased turnover additionally any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 121000  people worldwide approximately 20 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works council other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries as a result in august 2012 the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals in their products there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities our continued compliance with these disclosure rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices or that we will be able to satisfy customers who require our products to be conflict free also we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals 

not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement 

we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure in our fire security and life safety businesses than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because many of our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our installation service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances and we typically maintain product liability insurance to mitigate the risk that our products and services fail to operate as expected however in the event of litigation it is possible that contract limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable that our insurance coverage is not adequate or that insurance carriers deny coverage of our claims as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we do not own the right to use the adt® brand name in the us and canada 

we own the adt® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the us and canada and the adt corporation adt owns the brand name in the us and canada although tyco has entered agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt® brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the us and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the us and canada any of these factors may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies 

police departments in a limited number of jurisdictions do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance we have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies in most cases through contracts with us which increases the overall cost to customers if more police departments whether inside or outside the us were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our power solutions business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our power solutions business loss of or changes in automobile battery supply contracts with our large original equipment and aftermarket customers the increasing quality and useful life of batteries or use of alternative battery technologies both of which may adversely impact the leadacid battery market including replacement cycle delays or cancellations of new vehicle programs market and financial consequences of any recalls that may be required on our products delays or difficulties in new product development including lithiumion technology impact of potential increases in lithiumion battery volumes on established leadacid battery volumes as lithiumion battery technology grows and costs become more competitive financial instability or market declines of our customers or suppliers slower than projected market development in emerging markets interruption of supply of certain singlesource components changing nature of our joint ventures and relationships with our strategic business partners unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world our ability to secure sufficient tolling capacity to recycle batteries price and availability of battery cores used in recycling and the lack of the development of a market for hybrid and electric vehicles 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our buildings business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our buildings business loss of changes in or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers cancellation of or significant delays in projects in our backlog delays or difficulties in new product development the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies financial instability or market declines of our major component suppliers the unavailability of raw materials primarily steel copper and electronic components necessary for production of our products price increases of limitedsource components products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market unseasonable weather conditions in various parts 

of the world changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems revisions to energy efficiency or refrigerant legislation and natural or manmade disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers 

risks relating to strategic transactions 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination between johnson controls inc and tyco international plc 

the success of the merger will depend on among other things our ability to combine the legacy businesses of johnson controls and tyco in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by us we expect to benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and branch optimization as well as greater tax efficiencies from global management and global cash movement we may also enjoy revenue synergies including product and service crossselling a more diversified and expanded product offering and balance across geographic regions however we must successfully combine the legacy businesses of johnson controls and tyco in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized in addition we must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives we may not realize fully or at all the anticipated benefits of the merger or it may take longer to realize the benefits than expected 

other factors may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger or impact our future performance these include among other items the possibility that the contingent liabilities of either party including contingent tax liabilities are larger than expected the existence of unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger and possible adverse tax consequences pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws regulations or other administrative guidance in addition we may be subject to additional restrictions resulting from tyco’s incurrence of debt in connection with the merger and as a result of the companys irish domicile 

we may encounter significant difficulties in combining the legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses 

the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to combining the business practices and operations of the legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses this process may disrupt the businesses the failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect our results of operations the overall combination of legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

• the diversion of management attention to integration matters 

• difficulties in integrating operations and systems 

• challenges in conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and 

compensation structures between the two companies 

• difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel 

• challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers 

• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from the 

combination 

• difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company 

• contingent liabilities including contingent tax liabilities that are larger than expected and 

• potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger 

including possible adverse tax consequences to the combined company pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws or 

regulations 

many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company 

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance and strategic fit of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines for example on october 31 2016 we completed the spinoff of our automotive experience business and in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to sell our scott safety business which closed on october 4 2017 divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may also result in a diversion of management attention operational difficulties and losses 

the internal revenue service may not agree that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes and may not agree that the our us affiliates should not be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules 

under current us federal tax law a corporation is generally considered for us federal tax purposes to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation because johnson controls international plc is an irish incorporated entity it would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules however section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under section 7874 if 1 former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 80 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding johnson controls inc common stock the 80 ownership test and such ownership percentage the section 7874 ownership percentage and 2 our expanded affiliated group did not have substantial business activities in ireland the substantial business activities test we will be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes if the section 7874 ownership percentage of the former johnson controls inc shareholders after the merger was less than 80 but at least 60 the 60 ownership test and the substantial business activities test was not met we and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco may in some circumstances be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules which among other things could limit their ability to utilize certain us tax attributes to offset us taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions 

based on the terms of the merger the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 and certain factual assumptions we believe that former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 less than 60 by both vote and value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding shares of johnson controls inc common stock therefore under current law we believe that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 should otherwise not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the merger 

however the rules under section 7874 are relatively new and complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application in particular ownership for purposes of section 7874 is subject to various adjustments under the code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and there is limited guidance regarding section 7874 including with respect to the application of the ownership tests described therein as a result the determination of the section 7874 ownership percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties thus there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger 

in addition on january 13 2017 the us treasury and the irs finalized certain treasury regulations issued under section 7874 and revised certain related temporary regulations the section 7874 regulations which among other things require certain adjustments that generally increase for purposes of the section 7874 ownership tests the percentage of the stock of a foreign acquiring corporation deemed owned within the meaning of section 7874 by the former shareholders of an acquired us corporation by reason of holding stock in such us corporation for example these regulations disregard for purposes of determining this ownership percentage 1 any nonordinary course distributions within the meaning of the regulations made by the acquired us corporation such as johnson controls inc during the 36 months preceding the acquisition including certain dividends and share repurchases 2 potentially any cash consideration received by the shareholders of such us corporation in the acquisition to the extent such cash is directly or indirectly provided by the us corporation as well as 3 certain stock of the foreign acquiring corporation that was issued as consideration in a prior acquisition of another us corporation or us 

partnership during the 36 months preceding the signing date of a binding contract for the acquisition being tested taking into account the effect of these regulations we believe that the section 7874 ownership percentage of former johnson controls inc shareholders in us was less than 60 however these regulations are new and complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully assert that either the 80 ownership test or the 60 ownership test was met after the merger 

if the 80 ownership test was met after the merger and we were accordingly treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we would be subject to substantial additional us tax liability additionally in such case our nonus shareholders would be subject to us withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we pay to such shareholders subject to an exemption or reduced rate available under an applicable tax treaty regardless of any application of section 7874 we are treated as an irish tax resident for irish tax purposes consequently if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and irish taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if the 60 ownership test were met several adverse us federal income tax rules could apply to our us affiliates in particular in such case section 7874 could limit the ability of such us affiliates to utilize certain us tax attributes including net operating losses and certain tax credits to offset any taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions including any transfers or licenses of property to a foreign related person during the 10year period following the merger the section 7874 regulations generally expand the scope of these rules if the 60 ownership test were met after the merger such current and future limitations would apply to our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco and their application could limit their ability to utilize such us tax attributes against any income or gain recognized in connection with the adient spinoff in such case the application of such rules could result in significant additional us tax liability in addition the section 7874 regulations and certain related temporary regulations issued under other provisions of the code include new rules that would apply if the 60 ownership test were met which in such situation may limit our ability to restructure or access cash earned by certain of our nonus subsidiaries in each case without incurring substantial us tax liabilities 

future potential changes to the tax laws could result in our being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or in us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco being subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules 

as discussed above under current law we believe that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger however changes to section 7874 or the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes or could result in the application of certain adverse us federal income tax rules to us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application and may apply even though the merger has been consummated if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes or if we or our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco were to become subject to such adverse us federal income tax rules we and our us affiliates could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated 

certain legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of us corporate tax residence including in such a way as would cause us to be treated as a us corporation if our place of management and control or the place of management and control of our nonus affiliates were determined to be located primarily in the united states in addition certain legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of section 7874 or otherwise address certain perceived issues arising in connection with socalled inversion transactions for example multiple proposals introduced by certain democratic members of both houses of congress which if enacted in their present form would be effective retroactively to certain transactions including the merger would among other things treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 if the former shareholders of a us corporation acquired by such foreign acquiring corporation own more than 50 of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition these proposals if enacted in their present form and made retroactive to a date before the date of the closing of the merger would cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes in such case we would be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated it is presently uncertain whether any such proposals or other legislative action relating to the scope of us tax residence section 7874 or socalled inversion transactions and inverted groups will be enacted into law 

any legislative andor other proposals could cause us and our affiliates to be subject to certain intercompany financing limitations including with respect to their ability to deduct certain interest expense could limit or eliminate various other deductions or credits could impose taxes on certain crossborder payments or transfers could impose taxes on certain earnings of nonus entities on a current basis could change the timing of the recognition of income or its character could limit asset basis under certain circumstances could impose additional corporate taxes under certain circumstances to combat perceived base erosion issues and could limit deductions relating to employee compensation among other changes that could cause us or our affiliates to be subject 

to additional us federal income taxes any such proposals regulations and any other relevant provisions could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and could have a significant adverse effect on us and our affiliates it is presently uncertain whether legislative reform relating to the us federal income taxation of corporations and other business entities including the reforms described above will be enacted into law and in what form any such changes could have a material impact on our future financial results 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff of adient plc 

on october 31 2016 we completed the separation of our automotive experience business through the spinoff of adient plc to shareholders following the spinoff we are a smaller and less diversified company with a narrower business focus and as a result we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions 

although we believe that the spinoff of adient plc will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and shareholders the spinoff may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits in addition we have and will continue to incur onetime costs and ongoing costs in connection with or as a result of the spinoff including costs of operating as independent publiclytraded companies that the two businesses are no longer able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not realize the intended benefits of the spinoff or if our costs exceed our estimates we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

adient may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the adient spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff of adient we and adient have entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a transitional trademark license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the spinoff we will rely on adient to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if adient is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties or losses 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

legislative action in the us could materially and adversely affect us 

legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes impose additional taxes on payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus affiliates or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations such changes could have retroactive effect and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise incur business detriment 

legislation relating to governmental contracts could materially and adversely affect us 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

a judgment obtained against the combined company will be enforced by the courts of ireland if the following general requirements are met 

 

a judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending but where the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in ireland it remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive irish courts may also refuse to enforce a judgment of the us courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons 

 

as an irish company johnson controls is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of johnson controls international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

our effective tax rate may increase 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate including the potential legislative actions described in these risk factors which if enacted could result in an increase in our effective tax rate including the tcja as discussed above additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material increase in our effective tax rate 

changes to the us model income tax treaty could adversely affect us 

on february 17 2016 the us treasury released a revised us model income tax convention the new model which is the baseline text used by the us treasury to negotiate tax treaties the new model treaty provisions were preceded by draft versions released by the us treasury on may 20 2015 the may 2015 draft for public comment the revisions made to the model address certain aspects of the model by modifying existing provisions and introducing entirely new provisions specifically the new provisions target i permanent establishments subject to little or no foreign tax ii special tax regimes iii expatriated entities subject to section 7874 iv the antitreaty shopping measures of the limitation on benefits article and v subsequent changes in treaty partners tax laws 

with respect to new model provisions pertaining to expatriated entities because we do not believe that the merger resulted in the creation of an expatriated entity as defined in section 7874 payments of interest dividends royalties and certain other items of income by or to us andor our us affiliates to or from nonus persons would not be expected to become subject to full withholding tax even if applicable treaties were subsequently amended to adopt the new model provisions in response to comments the us treasury received regarding the may 2015 draft the new model treaty provisions pertaining to expatriated entities fix the definition of expatriated entity to the meaning ascribed to such term under section 7874a2a as of the date the relevant bilateral treaty is signed however as discussed above the rules under section 7874 are relatively new complex and are the subject of current and future legislative and regulatory changes accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that the merger did not result in the creation of an expatriated entity within the meaning of section 7874 under the law as in effect at the time the applicable treaty were to be amended or that such a challenge would not be sustained by a court or that such position would not be affected by future or regulatory action which may apply retroactively to the merger 

transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares there is no irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty is payable in respect of certain share transfers a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to johnson controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases johnson controls may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty johnson controls memorandum and articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment johnson controls i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii may have a lien against the johnson controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in johnson controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by johnson controls 

dividends paid by us may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we will be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders shareholders that are resident in the us european union countries other than ireland or other countries with which ireland has signed a tax treaty whether the treaty has been ratified or not generally should not be subject to irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided its broker for onward transmission to our qualifying intermediary or other designated agent in the case of shares held beneficially or us or our transfer agent in the case of shares held directly with all the necessary documentation by the appropriate due date prior to payment of the dividend however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of johnson controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

johnson controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls

environmental matters 

as noted in item 1 liabilities potentially arise globally under various environmental laws and worker safety laws for activities that are not in compliance with such laws and for the cleanup of sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

currently the company is responding to allegations that it is responsible for performing environmental remediation or for the repayment of costs spent by governmental entities or others performing remediation at approximately 48 sites in the united states for continuing operations many of these sites are landfills used by the company in the past for the disposal of waste materials others are secondary lead smelters and lead recycling sites where the company returned leadcontaining materials for recycling a few involve the cleanup of company manufacturing facilities and the remaining fall into miscellaneous categories the company may face similar claims of liability at additional sites in the future where potential liabilities are alleged the company pursues a course of action intended to mitigate them 

the company accrues for potential environmental liabilities when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable as of september 30 2017  reserves for environmental liabilities totaled 51 million  of which 10 million  was recorded within other current liabilities and 41 million  was recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position such potential liabilities accrued by the company do not take into consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds they do however take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites it is difficult to estimate the company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur nevertheless the company does not currently believe that any claims penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition the company has identified asset retirement obligations for environmental matters that are expected to be addressed at the retirement disposal removal or abandonment of existing owned facilities at september 30 2017  the company recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of 61 million  

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components 

as of september 30 2017  the companys estimated asbestos related net liability recorded on a discounted basis within the companys consolidated statements of financial position was 181 million  the net liability within the consolidated statements of financial position was comprised of a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of 573 million  of which 48 million was recorded in other current liabilities and 525 million was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities the company also maintained separate cash investments and receivables related to insurance recoveries within the consolidated statements of financial position of 392 million  of which 53 million was recorded in other current assets and 339 million was recorded in other noncurrent assets assets included 22 million of cash and 269 million of investments which have all been designated as restricted in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters the company records asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the amount of such recoveries recorded at september 30 2017  was 101 million  the company believes that the asbestos related liabilities and insurance related receivables recorded as of september 30 2017 are appropriate 

the companys estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present value from 2068 which is the companys reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestosrelated claims will be filed against company affiliates asbestos related defense costs are included in the asbestos liability the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2068 annually the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

the amounts recorded by the company for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets are based on the companys strategies for resolving its asbestos claims currently available information and a number of estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the companys calculations vary significantly from actual results 

insurable liabilities 

the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience at september 30 2017  the insurable liabilities totaled 445 million  of which 122 million  was recorded within other current liabilities 22 million  was recorded within accrued compensation and benefits and 301 million  was recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable the amount of such receivables recorded at september 30 2017  was 46 million  of which 31 million  was recorded within other current assets and 15 million  was recorded within other noncurrent assets the company maintains captive insurance companies to manage certain of its insurable liabilities

aqueous filmforming foam litigation 

two of our subsidiaries chemguard inc chemguard and tyco fire products lp tyco fire products have been named along with other defendant manufacturers in a number of class action lawsuits relating to the use of firefighting foam products by the us department of defense the dod and others for fire suppression purposes and related training exercises plaintiffs generally allege that the firefighting foam products manufactured by defendants contain or break down into the chemicals perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and that the use of these products by others at various airbases and airports resulted in the release of these chemicals into the environment and ultimately into communities’ drinking 

water supplies neighboring those airports and airbases plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages including damages for alleged personal injuries medical monitoring and alleged diminution in property values and also seek punitive damages and injunctive relief to address remediation of the alleged contamination as of november 21 2017 the company is named in 12 putative class actions in federal courts in three states as set forth below 

        colorado 

 

the above cases have been consolidated in the us district court for the district of colorado and a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is scheduled for april 2018 

new york 

 

responses to the complaints have not been filed yet in any of the new york actions 

pennsylvania 

 

the above cases have been consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint in the consolidated proceeding 

in addition to the putative class actions chemguard and tyco fire products are also defendants in an action filed by two plaintiffs in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania menkes et al v the 3m company et al filed february 7 2017 the menkes plaintiffs assert substantive claims and allegations similar to the putative class allegations but also include personal injury claim the company is also on notice of approximately 490 other possible individual product liability claims by filings made in pennsylvania state court but complaints have not been filed in those matters and under pennsylvania’s procedural rules they may or may not result in lawsuits 

chemguard and tyco fire products are also defendants in two cases pending in the us district court for the district of massachusetts town of barnstable v the 3m co et al filed nov 21 2016 and county of barnstable v the 3m co et al filed january 9 2017 these municipal plaintiffs generally allege that the use of the defendants’ firefighting foam products at a fire training academy and municipal airport released pfos and pfoa into the town’s water supply wells allegedly requiring remediation of the town and county property the defendants have filed a motion to dismiss in county of barnstable which is currently pending before the court 

the company is vigorously defending these cases and believes that it has meritorious defenses to class certification and the claims asserted however there are numerous factual and legal issues to be resolved in connection with these claims and it is extremely difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure if any represented by these matters but there can be no assurance that any such exposure will not be material the company is also pursuing insurance coverage for these matters 

the company is involved in various lawsuits claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment commercial and contractual matters and various other casualty matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us it is management’s opinion that none of these will have a material 

adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented

for all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test the fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated the hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 for commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges effectiveness is tested using a regression calculation ineffectiveness is minimal as the company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts 

for net investment hedges the company assesses its net investment positions in the nonus operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis the hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a nonus operation does not exceed the company’s net investment positions in the respective nonus operation

automotive experience 

the automotive experience business faces competition from other automotive suppliers and with respect to certain products from the automobile oems who produce or have the capability to produce certain products the business supplies the automotive supply industry competes on the basis of technology quality reliability of supply and price design engineering and product planning are increasingly important factors independent suppliers that represent the principal automotive experience seating competitors include lear corporation faurecia sa and magna international inc the automotive experience interiors business primarily competes with faurecia sa grupo antolin  irausa sa and international automotive components group sa

the company’s backlog relating to the buildings business is applicable to its sales of systems and services at september 30 2016  the backlog was 95 billion the majority of which relates to fiscal 2017 the backlog amount outstanding at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year 

raw materials 

raw materials used by the businesses in connection with their operations including lead steel tin aluminum urethane chemicals brass copper sulfuric acid polypropylene and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression agents were readily available during fiscal 2016  and the company expects such availability to continue in fiscal 2017 commodity prices could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the results of operations 

intellectual property 

generally the company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by contracts licenses confidentiality or other agreements 

the company owns numerous us and nonus patents and their respective counterparts the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products while the company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset no single patent or group of patents is critical to the success of the business the company from time to time grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others

environmental health and safety matters 

laws addressing the protection of the environment environmental laws and workers’ safety and health worker safety laws govern the company’s ongoing global operations they generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where companyrelated materials have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the company’s businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances 

the company’s operations and facilities have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of company 

related substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties see item 3 legal proceedings of this report for a discussion of the company’s potential environmental liabilities 

environmental capital expenditures 

the company’s ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions however expenditures in fiscal 2016  related solely to environmental compliance were not material it is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year 

government regulation and supervision 

the companys operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the united states in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states and nonus jurisdictions in which the company operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries the companys security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals wireline and wireless telephone companies in the united states are regulated by the federal and state governments in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact the companys fire businesses these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the company conducts its business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect the companys worldwide operations both favorably and unfavorably for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the companys business see item 1a risk factors

seasonal factors 

certain of building efficiencys sales are seasonal as the demand for residential air conditioning equipment generally increases in the summer months this seasonality is mitigated by the other products and services provided by the buildings business that have no material seasonal effect

risk factors 

tableend 

risks relating to business operations 

general economic credit and capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to grow or sustain our businesses and our ability to access the capital markets 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets global economic conditions affect each of our primary businesses as we discuss in greater detail in the specific risk factors for each of our businesses that appear below any future financial distress in the industries andor markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance in future periods result in future restructuring charges and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our businesses 

the capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide a worldwide economic downturn andor disruption of the credit markets could reduce our access to capital necessary for our operations and executing our strategic plan if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings prevailing industry conditions the volatility of the capital markets or other factors then our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by downturns in these industries 

much of the demand for installation of hvac security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit commercial and residential real estate markets are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values could lead to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors could in turn hamper demand for new hvac fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could raise the cost of new debt for our customers to prohibitive levels any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

decreased demand from our customers in the automotive industry may adversely affect our results of operations 

our financial performance in the power solutions business depends in part on conditions in the automotive industry sales to oems accounted for approximately 25 of the total sales of the power solutions business in fiscal 2016 declines in the north american european and asian automotive production levels could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations in addition if any oems reach a point where they cannot fund their operations we may incur writeoffs of accounts receivable incur impairment charges or require additional restructuring actions beyond our current restructuring plans which if significant would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

an inability to successfully respond to competition and pricing pressure from other companies in the power solutions business may adversely impact our business 

our power solutions business competes with a number of major us and nonus manufacturers and distributors of leadacid batteries as well as a large number of smaller regional competitors the north american european and asian leadacid battery markets are highly competitive the manufacturers in these markets compete on price quality technical innovation service and warranty if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain market share in the regions and markets we serve our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 

increases in commodity costs can negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on such orders are typically fixed therefore in the shortterm we cannot adjust for changes in certain commodity prices in these cases if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations additionally unfavorability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level 

in our power solutions business lead is a major component of leadacid batteries and the price of lead may be highly volatile we attempt to manage the impact of changing lead prices through the recycling of used batteries returned to us by our aftermarket customers commercial terms and commodity hedging programs our ability to mitigate the impact of lead price changes can be impacted by many factors including customer negotiations inventory level fluctuations and sales volumemix changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally the prices of other commodities primarily fuel acid resin and tin may be volatile if other commodity prices rise and if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations moreover the implementation of any price increases to our customers could negatively impact the demand for our products 

we rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business 

unlike many of our competitors the company relies on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue the direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions and hvac equipment manufactured by the company this represents a significant distribution channel for our products creates a large installed base of our fire and security solutions and hvac equipment and creates opportunities for longer term service and monitoring revenue if we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business whether due to changes in economic conditions a failure to anticipate changing customer needs a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions or for any other reason our installation revenue could decline which could in turn adversely impact our product pull through and our ability to grow service and monitoring revenue 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive and increasingly complex products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products and services requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer in addition the markets for our products 

and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance the potential for product defects product quality issues or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with our nonus operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the us some of which are located in emerging markets longterm economic uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which we operate such as asia south america the middle east europe and emerging markets could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service requirements 

in addition as a result of our global presence a significant portion of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are therefore subject to nonus currency risks and nonus exchange exposure while we employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures for example the announcement of the united kingdom’s decision to exit the european union caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and british pound sterling exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the us and adversely impact the comparability of results from period to period 

there are other risks that are inherent in our nonus operations including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions laws and regulations including import export labor and environmental laws and monetary and fiscal policies protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures or impact trade volumes unsettled political conditions governmentimposed plant or other operational shutdowns backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions corruption natural and manmade disasters hazards and losses violence civil and labor unrest and possible terrorist attacks 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our nonus operations and therefore on our business and results of operations 

our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws codes and standards and other laws and regulations changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations and laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws around the world 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with antibribery laws we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party 

intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition 

as previously reported we and the securities and exchange commission sec resolved alleged fcpa violations related to the building efficiency marine business in china dating back to 2007 which the company had selfreported to the sec and the department of justice doj in june 2013 and we are subject to a cease and desist order “order” issued by the sec related to this matter that requires us to make certain reports to the sec over a one year period notwithstanding the resolution of this matter with the sec we may be subject to allegations of fcpa or similar bribery violations in the future and we may be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of these compliance matters if so or if we are unable to comply with the provisions of the order and other agreements we may be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the sec doj or other governmental agencies in such a case we could be subject to material fines injunctions on future conduct the imposition of a compliance monitor or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the us government 

our customers include many us federal state and local government authorities doing business with the us government and state and local authorities subjects us to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for failure to perform under the applicable contract we are subject to potential government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations in addition various us federal and state legislative proposals have been made that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of trademarks trade secrets patents copyrights knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming and the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

global climate change could negatively affect our business 

increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty such regulatory uncertainty extends to incentives that if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energy efficient buildings and batteries for energy efficient vehicles and could increase costs of compliance these factors may impact the demand for our products obsolescence of our products and our results of operations 

there is a growing consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to global climate changes climate changes such as extreme weather conditions create financial risk to our business for example the demand for our products and services such as residential air conditioning equipment and automotive replacement batteries may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions climate changes could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs these factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks the company could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and process disruptions due to physical climate changes could result in price modifications for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 

we have projects underway at multiple current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties these projects relate to a variety of activities including solvent oil metal lead and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement because of uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be liable future expenses that we may incur to remediate identified sites could be considerably higher than the current accrued liability on our consolidated statements of financial position which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to requirements relating to environmental and safety regulations and environmental remediation matters including those related to the manufacturing and recycling of leadacid batteries which could adversely affect our business results of operation and reputation 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other things solid and hazardous waste storage treatment and disposal and remediation of releases of hazardous materials including as it pertains to lead the primary material used in the manufacture of leadacid batteries there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials 

federal state and local authorities also regulate a variety of matters including but not limited to health safety and permitting in addition to the environmental matters discussed above new legislation and regulations may require the company to make material changes to its operations resulting in significant increases to the cost of production 

we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the amounts we have recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets in the consolidated statements of financial position are based on our current strategy for resolving asbestos claims currently available information and a number of variables estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants and the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption 

predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in our calculations vary significantly from actual results if actual liabilities are significantly higher than those recorded the cost of resolving such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

risks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

significant changes in actual investment return on defined benefit plan assets discount rates mortality assumptions and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and the amounts of contributions we must make to our defined benefit plans in future periods because we marktomarket our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities on an annual basis large noncash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year generally accepted accounting principles in the us require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates which may change based on economic conditions funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon among other factors interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations for a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost refer to critical accounting estimates and policies included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions which could adversely affect our profitability and operations 

to align our resources with our growth strategies operate more efficiently and control costs we periodically announce restructuring plans which may include workforce reductions global plant closures and consolidations asset impairments and other cost reduction initiatives we may undertake additional restructuring actions and workforce reductions in the future as these plans and actions are complex unforeseen factors could result in expected savings and benefits to be delayed or not realized to the full extent planned and our operations and business may be disrupted 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to additional changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position and the future sale of certain businesses could potentially result in the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations additionally changes in tax laws in the us ireland or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position and our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims there is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our results of operations that is greater than we anticipate andor negatively affect our reputation 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt historically we have relied on our ability to issue commercial paper rather than to draw on our credit 

facility to support our daily operations which means that a downgrade in our ratings or volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 

additionally several of our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be unable to complete or integrate acquisitions or joint ventures effectively which may adversely affect our growth profitability and results of operations 

we expect acquisitions of businesses and assets as well as joint ventures or other strategic arrangements to play a role in our future growth we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition or joint venture targets obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms successfully acquire identified targets or form joint ventures or manage the timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses additionally we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses or joint ventures into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies which could result in impairment of assets including goodwill and acquired intangible assets given the significance of the companys recent acquisitions the goodwill and intangible assets recorded were significant and impairment of such assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions if we were to use equity securities to finance a future acquisition our thencurrent shareholders would experience dilution we are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior these and other factors related to acquisitions and joint ventures may negatively and adversely impact our growth profitability and results of operations 

risks associated with joint venture investments may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have entered into several joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures in the future our joint venture partners may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture in addition we may compete against our joint venture partners in certain of our other markets disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships our joint venture arrangements may require us among other matters to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments or to seek our joint venture partner’s consent to take certain actions in addition our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations under the operative documents and we may be required to either fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture or to dissolve and liquidate a joint venture these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain administrative functions 

we have been regionally centralizing certain administrative functions primarily in north america europe and asia to improve efficiency and reduce costs to the extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled key business processes such as invoicing payments and general management operations could be interrupted which could have an adverse impact on our business 

a failure of our information technology it and data security infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 

we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system or a security breach of our it systems including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business 

we and certain of our thirdparty vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business despite our implementation of security measures our it systems like those of other companies are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized access cyber attack and other similar disruptions any system failure accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations a material network breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property trade secrets customer information human resources information or other confidential matter to the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential proprietary or customer information it could cause significant damage to our reputation affect our relationships with our customers lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future 

a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan organizational and reporting changes resulting from the merger and the spinoff of the automotive experience business separation or as a result of any future leadership transition or corporate initiatives could result in increased turnover additionally any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 209000 people worldwide approximately 13 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works council other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries as a result in august 2012 the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals in their products there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities our continued compliance with these disclosure rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices or that we will be able to satisfy customers who require our 

products to be conflict free also we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement 

we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure in our fire security and life safety businesses than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because many of our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection or life safety systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our installation service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances and we typically maintain product liability insurance to mitigate the risk that our products and services fail to operate as expected however in the event of litigation it is possible that contract limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable that our insurance coverage is not adequate or that insurance carriers deny coverage of our claims as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we do not own the right to use the adt® brand name in the us and canada 

tyco owns the adt® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the us and canada and the adt corporation adt owns the brand name in the us and canada although tyco has entered agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt® brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the us and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the us and canada any of these factors may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies 

police departments in a limited number of jurisdictions do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance we have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies in most cases through contracts with us which increases the overall cost to customers if more police departments whether inside or outside the us were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our power solutions business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our power solutions business loss of or changes in automobile battery supply contracts with our large original equipment and aftermarket customers the increasing quality and useful life of batteries or use of alternative battery technologies both of which may adversely impact the leadacid battery market including replacement cycle delays or cancellations of new vehicle programs market and financial consequences of any recalls that may be required on our products delays or difficulties in new product development including lithiumion technology impact of potential increases in lithiumion battery volumes on established leadacid battery volumes as lithiumion battery technology grows and costs become more competitive financial instability or market declines of our customers or suppliers slower than projected market development in emerging markets interruption of supply of certain singlesource components changing nature of our joint ventures and relationships with our strategic business partners unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world our ability to secure sufficient tolling capacity to recycle batteries price and availability of battery cores used in recycling and the lack of the development of a market for hybrid and electric vehicles 

a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our building business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our building business loss of changes in or failure to perform under guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers cancellation of or significant delays in projects in our backlog delays or difficulties in new product development the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies financial instability or market declines of our major component suppliers the unavailability of raw materials primarily steel copper and electronic components necessary for production of our products price increases of limitedsource 

components products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems revisions to energy efficiency or refrigerant legislation and natural or manmade disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver products and services to our customers 

risks relating to recent strategic transactions 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination between johnson controls inc and tyco international plc 

the success of the merger will depend on among other things our ability to combine the legacy businesses of johnson controls and tyco in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by us we expect to benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and branch optimization as well as greater tax efficiencies from global management and global cash movement we may also enjoy revenue synergies including product and service crossselling a more diversified and expanded product offering and balance across geographic regions however we must successfully combine the legacy businesses of johnson controls and tyco in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized in addition we must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives we may not realize fully or at all the anticipated benefits of the merger or it may take longer to realize the benefits than expected 

other factors may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger or impact our future performance these include among other items the possibility that the contingent liabilities of either party including contingent tax liabilities are larger than expected the existence of unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger and possible adverse tax consequences pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws regulations or other administrative guidance including potential adverse tax consequences that could result from recently issued treasury regulations concerning the treatment of relatedparty debt or if any recently introduced antiinversion legislative proposals were to be enacted in their current form and retroactively applied to the merger in addition we may be subject to additional restrictions resulting from tyco’s incurrence of debt in connection with the merger and as a result of the companys irish domicile 

we may encounter significant difficulties in combining the legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses 

the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to combining the business practices and operations of the legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses this process may disrupt the businesses the failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect our results of operations the overall combination of legacy johnson controls and tyco businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

• the diversion of management attention to integration matters 

• difficulties in integrating operations and systems 

• challenges in conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and 

compensation structures between the two companies 

• difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel 

• challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers 

• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from the 

combination 

• difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company 

• contingent liabilities including contingent tax liabilities that are larger than expected and 

• potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger 

including possible adverse tax consequences to the combined company pursuant to changes in applicable tax laws or 

regulations 

many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company 

the internal revenue service may not agree that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes and may not agree that the our us affiliates should not be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules 

under current us federal tax law a corporation is generally considered for us federal tax purposes to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation because johnson controls international plc is an irish incorporated entity it would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules however section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

under section 7874 if 1 former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 80 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding johnson controls inc common stock the 80 ownership test and such ownership percentage the section 7874 ownership percentage and 2 our expanded affiliated group did not have substantial business activities in ireland the substantial business activities test we will be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes if the section 7874 ownership percentage of the former johnson controls inc shareholders after the merger was less than 80 but at least 60 the 60 ownership test and the substantial business activities test was not met we and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco may in some circumstances be subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules which among other things could limit their ability to utilize certain us tax attributes to offset us taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions 

based on the terms of the merger the rules for determining share ownership under section 7874 and certain factual assumptions we believe that former johnson controls inc shareholders owned within the meaning of section 7874 less than 60 by both vote and value of our ordinary shares after the merger by reason of holding shares of johnson controls inc common stock therefore under current law we believe that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 should otherwise not apply to us or our affiliates as a result of the merger 

however the rules under section 7874 are relatively new and complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application in particular ownership for purposes of section 7874 is subject to various adjustments under the code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and there is limited guidance regarding section 7874 including with respect to the application of the ownership tests described therein as a result the determination of the section 7874 ownership percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties thus there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that we should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger 

in addition on april 4 2016 the us treasury and the irs issued temporary treasury regulations under section 7874 the temporary section 7874 regulations which among other things require certain adjustments that generally increase for purposes of the section 7874 ownership tests the percentage of the stock of a foreign acquiring corporation deemed owned within the meaning of section 7874 by the former shareholders of an acquired us corporation by reason of holding stock in such us corporation for example these temporary regulations disregard for purposes of determining this ownership percentage 1 any nonordinary course distributions within the meaning of the temporary regulations made by the acquired us corporation such as johnson controls inc during the 36 months preceding the acquisition including certain dividends and share repurchases 2 potentially any cash consideration received by the shareholders of such us corporation in the acquisition to the extent such cash is directly or indirectly provided by the us corporation as well as 3 certain stock of the foreign acquiring corporation that was issued as consideration in a prior acquisition of another us corporation or us partnership during the 36 months preceding the signing date of a binding contract for the acquisition being tested taking into account the effect of these temporary regulations we believe that the section 7874 ownership percentage of former johnson controls inc shareholders in us was less than 60 however these temporary regulations are new and complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully assert that either the 80 ownership test or the 60 ownership test was met after the merger 

if the 80 ownership test was met after the merger and we were accordingly treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we would be subject to substantial additional us tax liability additionally in such case our nonus shareholders would be subject to us withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we pay to such shareholders subject to an exemption or reduced rate available under an applicable tax treaty regardless of any application of section 7874 we are treated as an irish tax resident for irish tax purposes consequently if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and irish taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if the 60 ownership test were met several adverse us federal income tax rules could apply to our us affiliates in particular in such case section 7874 could limit the ability of such us affiliates to utilize certain us tax attributes including net operating losses and certain tax credits to offset any taxable income or gain resulting from certain transactions including any transfers or licenses of property to a foreign related person during the 10year period following the merger the temporary section 7874 regulations generally expand the scope of these rules if the 60 ownership test were met after the merger such current and future limitations would apply to our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco and their application could limit their ability to utilize such us tax attributes against any income or gain recognized in connection with the adient spinoff in such case the application of such rules could result in significant additional us tax liability in addition the temporary section 7874 regulations and certain related temporary regulations issued under other provisions of the code include new rules that would apply if the 60 ownership test were met which in such situation may limit our ability to restructure or access cash earned by certain of our nonus subsidiaries in each case without incurring substantial us tax liabilities 

future potential changes to the tax laws could result in our being treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes or in us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco being subject to certain adverse us federal income tax rules 

as discussed above under current law we believe that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes and that section 7874 does not otherwise apply as a result of the merger however changes to section 7874 or the us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal tax purposes or could result in the application of certain adverse us federal income tax rules to us and our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application and may apply even though the merger has been consummated if we were to be treated as a us corporation for federal tax purposes or if we or our us affiliates including the us affiliates historically owned by tyco were to become subject to such adverse us federal income tax rules we and our us affiliates could be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated 

recent legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of us corporate tax residence including in such a way as would cause us to be treated as a us corporation if our place of management and control or the place of management and control of our nonus affiliates were determined to be located primarily in the united states in addition recent legislative and other proposals have aimed to expand the scope of section 7874 or otherwise address certain perceived issues arising in connection with socalled inversion transactions for example multiple proposals introduced by certain democratic members of both houses of congress which if enacted in their present form would be effective retroactively to certain transactions including the merger would among other things treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 if the former shareholders of a us corporation acquired by such foreign acquiring corporation own more than 50 of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition these proposals if enacted in their present form and made retroactive to a date before the date of the closing of the merger would cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes in such case we would be subject to substantially greater us tax liability than currently contemplated 

other recent legislative and other proposals if enacted as well as the recently issued treasury regulations relating to treatment of relatedparty debt under section 385 of the code could cause us and our affiliates to be subject to certain intercompany financing limitations including with respect to their ability to deduct certain interest expense and could cause us and our affiliates to recognize additional taxable income any such proposals regulations and any other relevant provisions that could change on a prospective or retroactive basis could have a significant adverse effect on us and our affiliates 

it is presently uncertain whether any such proposals or other legislative action relating to the scope of us tax residence section 7874 or socalled inversion transactions and inverted groups will be enacted into law and whether the recently issued treasury regulations relating to treatment of relatedparty debt could have a material impact on our future financial results 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff of adient plc 

on october 31 2016 we completed the separation of our automotive experience through the spinoff of adient plc to shareholders following the spinoff we are a smaller and less diversified company with a narrower business focus and as a result we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions 

although we believe that the spinoff of adient plc will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and shareholders the spinoff may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits in addition we have and will continue to incur onetime costs and ongoing costs in connection with or as a result of the spinoff including costs of operating as independent publiclytraded companies that the two businesses are no longer able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not 

realize the intended benefits of the spinoff or if our costs exceed our estimates we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

adient may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation we and adient have entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a transitional trademark license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation we will rely on adient to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if adient is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties or losses 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

legislative action in the us could materially and adversely affect us 

legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise affect the taxes that the us imposes on our worldwide operations such changes could have retroactive effect and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise incur business detriment 

legislation relating to governmental contracts could materially and adversely affect us 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that have moved their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

a judgment obtained against the combined company will be enforced by the courts of ireland if the following general requirements are met 

 

a judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending but where the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of the judgment it is possible that in the meantime the judgment may not be actionable in ireland it remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive irish courts may also refuse to enforce a judgment of the us courts which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons 



 

as an irish company johnson controls is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of johnson controls international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

our effective tax rate may increase 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate including the potential legislative actions described in these risk factors which if enacted could result in an increase in our effective tax rate additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material increase in our effective tax rate 

changes to the us model income tax treaty could adversely affect us 

on february 17 2016 the us treasury released a newly revised us model income tax convention the model which is the baseline text used by the us treasury to negotiate tax treaties the new model treaty provisions were preceded by draft versions released by the us treasury on may 20 2015 the may 2015 draft for public comment the revisions made to the model address certain aspects of the model by modifying existing provisions and introducing entirely new provisions specifically the new provisions target i permanent establishments subject to little or no foreign tax ii special tax regimes iii expatriated entities subject to section 7874 iv the antitreaty shopping measures of the limitation on benefits article and v subsequent changes in treaty partners tax laws 

with respect to new model provisions pertaining to expatriated entities because we do not believe that the merger resulted in the creation of an expatriated entity as defined in section 7874 payments of interest dividends royalties and certain other items of income by or to us andor our us affiliates to or from nonus persons would not be expected to become subject to full withholding tax even if applicable treaties were subsequently amended to adopt the new model provisions in response to comments the us treasury received regarding the may 2015 draft the new model treaty provisions pertaining to expatriated entities fix the definition of expatriated entity to the meaning ascribed to such term under section 7874a2a as of the date the relevant bilateral treaty is signed however as discussed above the rules under section 7874 are relatively new complex and are the subject of current and future legislative and regulatory changes accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that the merger did not result in the creation of an expatriated entity within the meaning of section 7874 under the law as in effect at the time the applicable treaty were to be amended or that such a challenge would not be sustained by a court or that such position would not be affected by future or regulatory action which may apply retroactively to the merger 

transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of johnson controls ordinary shares there is no irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty is payable in respect of certain share transfers a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of johnson controls ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to johnson controls transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases johnson controls may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty johnson controls memorandum and articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment johnson controls i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii may have a lien against the johnson controls ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on 

such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in johnson controls ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by johnson controls 

dividends you receive may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we may be required to deduct johnson controls dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders whether johnson controls is required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax from dividends paid to a shareholder depends largely on whether that shareholder is resident for tax purposes in a “relevant territory” a list of the “relevant territories” is included as annex c to the proxy statementprospectus related to the redomicile to ireland 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of johnson controls ordinary shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls 

johnson controls shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in johnson controls

environmental matters 

as noted in item 1 liabilities potentially arise globally under various environmental laws and worker safety laws for activities that are not in compliance with such laws and for the cleanup of sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

currently the company is responding to allegations that it is responsible for performing environmental remediation or for the repayment of costs spent by governmental entities or others performing remediation at approximately 51 sites in the united states many of these sites are landfills used by the company in the past for the disposal of waste materials others are secondary lead smelters and lead recycling sites where the company returned leadcontaining materials for recycling a few involve the cleanup of company manufacturing facilities and the remaining fall into miscellaneous categories the company may face similar claims of liability at additional sites in the future where potential liabilities are alleged the company pursues a course of action intended to mitigate them 

the company accrues for potential environmental liabilities when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable as of september 30 2016  reserves for environmental liabilities totaled 55 million  of which 15 million was recorded within other current liabilities and 40 million was recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position the company reviews the status of its environmental sites on a quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly such potential liabilities accrued by the company do not take into consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds they do however take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites it is difficult to estimate the company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur nevertheless the company does not currently believe that any claims penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition the company has identified asset retirement obligations for environmental matters that are expected to be addressed at the retirement disposal removal or abandonment of existing owned facilities primarily in the power solutions and building efficiency businesses at september 30 2016  the company recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of 74 million  

in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 our power solutions business entered into a consent order with the south carolina department of health and environmental control related to alleged violations of us environmental protection agency and south carolina air regulations and permit conditions and failure to comply with standard operating procedures at the company’s florence south carolina battery recycling center the consent order obligates the company to implement a number of corrective actions and required the payment of a civil penalty of 250000 which the company has paid 

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components 

as of september 30 2016 the companys estimated asbestos related net liability recorded on a discounted basis within the companys consolidated statements of financial position is 148 million the net liability within the consolidated statements of financial position is comprised of a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of 548 million of which 35 million is recorded in other current liabilities and 513 million is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities the company also maintains separate cash investments and receivables related to insurance recoveries within the consolidated statements of financial position of 400 million of which 41 million is recorded in other current assets and 359 million is recorded in other noncurrent assets assets include 16 million of cash and 264 million of investments which have all been designated as restricted in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters the company records asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the amount of such recoveries recorded at september 30 2016 is 120 million the company believes that the asbestos related liabilities and insurance related receivables recorded as of september 30 2016 are appropriate 

the companys estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present value from 2069 which is the companys reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestosrelated claims will be filed against company affiliates asbestos related defense costs are included in the asbestos liability the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2069 annually the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

the amounts recorded by the company for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets are based on the companys strategies for resolving its asbestos claims currently available information and a number of estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the companys calculations vary significantly from actual results 

insurable liabilities 

the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience at september 30 2016 the insurable liabilities totaled 473 million of which 70 million was recorded within other current liabilities 36 million was recorded within accrued compensation and benefits and 367 million was recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable the company maintains captive insurance companies to manage certain of its insurable liabilities

income tax provision 



 measure not meaningful 

the us federal statutory tax rate is being used as a comparison since the company was a us domiciled company in fiscal 2015 and for11 months of 2016 the effective rate is above the us statutory rate for fiscal 2016 primarily due to the tax consequences surrounding the planned spinoff of the automotive experience business and related expenses the jurisdictional mix of restructuring and impairment costs and the tax impacts of the merger and integration related costs partially offset by the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives and foreign tax rate differentials the effective rate is below the us statutory rate for fiscal 2015 primarily due to the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives income in certain nonus jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory tax rate and adjustments due to tax audit resolutions partially offset by the tax consequences of business divestitures and significant restructuring and impairment costs the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate increased as compared to the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate primarily due to the tax effects of transactions predominantly due to the planned spinoff 1795 million and the tax effects of restructuring and impairment costs 74 million partially offset by tax planning initiatives 151 million the fiscal year 2016 and 2015 global tax planning initiatives related primarily to foreign tax credit planning global financing structures and alignment of our global business functions in a tax efficient manner refer to note 18 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the company performed an analysis related to the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets as a result and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence the company determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily within spain germany and the united kingdom would not be realized and was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets of poland and germany would be realized the impact of the net valuation allowance provision offset the benefit of valuation allowance releases and as such there was no net impact to income tax expense in the three month period or year ended september 30 2015 

uncertain tax positions

the company’s federal income tax returns and certain nonus income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the internal revenue service irs and respective nonus tax authorities although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments if any which may be proposed by the taxing authorities at september 30 2016  the company had recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position nonetheless the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

after the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 on october 13 2016 the us treasury and the irs released final and temporary section 385 regulations these regulations address whether certain instruments between related parties are treated as debt or equity the company does not expect that the regulations will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the lookthrough rule under subpart f of the us internal revenue code expired for the company on september 30 2015 the lookthrough rule had provided an exception to the us taxation of certain income generated by foreign subsidiaries the rule was extended in december 2015 retroactive to the beginning of the company’s 2016 fiscal year the retroactive extension was signed into legislation and was made permanent through the companys 2020 fiscal year

the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement benefits plan assets and obligations are measured annually or more frequently if there is a remeasurement event based on the company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

the company utilizes a marktomarket approach for recognizing pension and postretirement benefit expenses including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event refer to note 15 retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the companys pension and postretirement benefit plans 

us gaap requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are overfunded us gaap also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plan’s funded status as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year end 

the company considers the expected benefit payments on a planbyplan basis when setting assumed discount rates as a result the company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments for the us pension and postretirement plans the company uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds for the nonus pension and postretirement plans the company consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates the company’s discount rate on us pension plans was 370  and 440  at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively the company’s discount rate on postretirement plans was 330  and 375  at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively the company’s weighted average discount rate on nonus pension plans was 190  and 315  at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively 

at september 30 2015 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits for plans that utilize a yield curve approach this change compared to the previous method will result in different service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost credit in future periods historically the company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period the company elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows the company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations or annual net periodic benefit cost credit as the change in the service and interest costs is completely offset in the net actuarial gain loss reported the change in the service and interest costs was not significant the company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets the company considers the historical returns on plan assets adjusted for forwardlooking considerations inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans’ invested assets reflecting the relatively longterm nature of the plans’ obligations approximately 47 of the plans’ assets are invested in fixed income securities and 41 in equity securities with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments for the years ending september 30 2016  and 2015  the company’s expected longterm return on us pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 750  the actual rate of return on us pension plans was above 750 in fiscal 2016  and was below 750 in

beginning in fiscal 2017  the company believes the longterm rate of return will approximate 750 340 and 560 for us pension nonus pension and postretirement plans respectively any differences between actual investment results and the expected longterm asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year if the company’s actual returns on plan assets are less than the company’s expectations additional contributions may be required 

in fiscal 2016  total employer contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were 136 million  of which 34 million  were voluntary contributions made by the company the company expects to contribute approximately 326 million  in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2017   including 247 million due to changeincontrol provisions triggered by the tyco merger in fiscal 2016  total employer and employee contributions to the postretirement plans were 7 million  the company expects to contribute approximately 4 million in cash to its postretirement plans in fiscal 2017

risk management 

the company selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency commodities interest rates and stockbased compensation all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes at the inception of the hedge the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either 1 a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of a recognized firm commitment a fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a nonus operation a net investment hedge the company performs hedge effectiveness 

testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used all other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 derivatives and hedging are revalued in the consolidated statements of income 

for all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test the fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated the hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 for commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges effectiveness is tested using a regression calculation ineffectiveness is minimal as the company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts 

for net investment hedges the company assesses its net investment positions in the nonus operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis the hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a nonus operation does not exceed the company’s net investment positions in the respective nonus operation 

the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market risk associated with changes in interest rates for its fixedrate bonds at september 30 2016  all outstanding interest rate swaps qualify for the longhaul method the company assesses retrospective and prospective effectiveness and records any measured ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of income on a monthly basis 

equity swaps and any other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under asc 815 require no assessment of effectiveness 

a discussion of the company’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 10 derivative instruments and hedging activities and note 11 fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange 

the company has manufacturing sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies in order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the company’s global diversification foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are as appropriate hedged with financial instruments 

the company hedges 70 to 90 of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures the company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items the company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 

the company had entered into crosscurrency interest rate swaps and foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of the crosscurrency interest rate swaps and debt obligations are reflected in the aoci account within shareholders’   equity attributable to johnson controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the company’s net investm ents globally 

at september 30 2016  and 2015  the company estimates that an unfavorable 10 change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately 297 million and 234 million respectively 

interest rates 

the company uses interest rate swaps to offset its exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with asc 815 these outstanding swaps qualify and are designated as fair value hedges the company had eight interest rate swaps totaling 850 million outstanding at september 30 2016  and twelve interest rates swaps totaling 17 billion outstanding at september 30 2015  a 10 increase in the average cost of the company’s variable rate debt would have resulted in an unfavorable change in pretax interest expense of approximately 11 million and 6 million for the year ended september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively 

commodities 

the company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines as a cash flow hedge gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business the maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities 

environmental health and safety and other matters 

the company’s global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws under various circumstances these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material 

the company accrues for potential environmental liabilities when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable as of september 30 2016  reserves for environmental liabilities totaled 55 million  of which 15 million was recorded within other current liabilities and 40 million was recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position the company’s environmental liabilities do not take into consideration any possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds because of the uncertainties associated with environmental remediation activities at sites where the company may be potentially liable future expenses to remediate identified sites could be considerably higher than the accrued liability however while neither the timing nor the amount of ultimate costs associated with known environmental remediation matters can be determined at this time the company does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition the company has identified asset retirement obligations for environmental matters that are expected to be addressed at the retirement disposal removal or abandonment of existing owned facilities primarily in the power solutions and buildings businesses at september 30 2016  the company recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of 74 million  

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components as of september 30 2016 the companys estimated asbestos related net liability recorded on a discounted basis within the companys consolidated statements of financial position is 148 million the net liability within the consolidated statements of financial position is comprised of a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of 548 million of which 35 million is recorded in other current liabilities and 513 million is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities the company also maintains separate cash investments and receivables related to insurance recoveries within the consolidated statements of financial position of 400 million of which 41 million is recorded in other current assets and 359 million is recorded in other noncurrent assets assets include 16 million of cash and 264 million of investments which have all been designated as restricted in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters the company records asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the amount of such recoveries recorded at september 30 2016 is 120 million the company believes that the asbestos related liabilities and insurance related receivables recorded as of september 30 2016 are appropriate the assets recorded in fiscal 2016 were as a result of assets acquired as part of the tyco merger 

the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience at september 30 2016 the insurable liabilities totaled 473 million of which 70 million was recorded within other current liabilities 36 million was recorded within accrued compensation and benefits and 367 million was recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable the company maintains captive insurance companies to manage certain of its insurable liabilities 

the company is involved in various lawsuits claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health intellectual property employment commercial and contractual matters and various other casualty matters although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us it is management’s opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented  refer to note 23 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

fire protection products systems often are purchased or specified by facility owners through general and subcontractors in the fire protection field in recent years retrofitting of existing buildings has increased as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems especially in hotels restaurants healthcare facilities and educational establishments the 2009 through 2015 editions of the international residential code developed by the international code council a nonprofit association that develops model codes that are the predominant building and fire safety regulations followed by state and local jurisdictions in the united states continue to require sprinkler systems in new one and twofamily homes and townhouses since january 2011 this national code is not binding on state and local jurisdictions and must be adopted locally before it becomes mandatory for new homes being built in these areas fire protection products continues to advocate for the adoption of these requirements to reduce the future loss of life due to residential fires the timing and extent of adoption if at all will vary by jurisdiction however we believe that this development may offer opportunities to expand our residential fire suppression business in the united states

competition 

the markets that we serve are generally highly competitive and fragmented with a small number of large global firms and thousands of smaller regional and local companies competition is based on price specialized product capacity breadth of product line training support and delivery with the relative importance of these factors varying depending on the project complexity product line the local market and other factors rather than compete primarily on price we emphasize the quality of our products and services the reputation of our brands and our knowledge of customers fire and security needs among large industrial commercial governmental and institutional customers we believe that our comprehensive global coverage and product and service offerings provide a competitive advantage we also believe that our systems integration capabilities which allow us to offer global solutions to customers that fully integrate our security andor fire offerings into existing information technology networks business operations and management tools and process automation and control systems set us apart from all but a small number of other large global competitors 

competitive dynamics in the fire and security industry generally result in more direct competition and lower margins for installation projects compared to aftermarket products and services we generally face the greatest competitive pricing pressure for the installation of products that have become more commoditized over time including standard commercial sprinkler systems and closedcircuit television systems

we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including fuel for our vehicle fleet we purchase materials from a large number of independent sources around the world and have experienced no shortages that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses we enter into longterm supply contracts using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions significant changes in certain raw material including steel brass and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression agents may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the united states in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states and nonus jurisdictions in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries our security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals wireline and wireless telephone companies in the united states are regulated by the federal and state governments in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our fire businesses these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations both favorably and unfavorably for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors—risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

environmental matters 

we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 25 2015  we concluded that it was probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 23 million  to 72 million  as of september 25 2015  tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 33 million  of which 11 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 22 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet 

the majority of the liabilities described above relate to ongoing remediation efforts at a facility in the companys global products segment located in marinette wisconsin which the company acquired in 1990 in connection with its acquisition of among other things the ansul product line prior to tycos acquisition ansul manufactured arsenicbased agricultural herbicides at the marinette facility which resulted in significant arsenic contamination of soil and groundwater on the marinette site and in parts of the adjoining menominee river ansul has been engaged in ongoing remediation efforts at the marinette site since 1990 and in february 2009 entered into an administrative consent order the consent order with the us environmental protection agency to address the presence of arsenic at the marinette site under this agreement ansuls principal obligations are to contain the arsenic contamination on the site pump and treat onsite groundwater dredge treat and properly dispose of contaminated sediments in the adjoining river areas and monitor contamination levels on an ongoing basis activities completed under the consent order since 2009 include the installation of a subsurface barrier wall around the facility to contain contaminated groundwater the installation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system and the dredging and offsite disposal of treated river sediment as of september 25 2015  the company concluded that its remaining remediation and monitoring costs related to the marinette facility were in the range of approximately 14 million  to 46 million  the companys best estimate within that range is approximately 23 million  of which 9 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 14 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet during the years ended september 25 2015  september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  the company recorded charges of nil  nil  and 100 million  respectively in selling general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statement of operations although the company has recorded its best estimate of the costs that it will incur to remediate and monitor the arsenic contamination at the marinette facility it is possible that technological regulatory or enforcement developments the results of 

environmental studies or other factors could change the companys expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays and such changes could be material to the companys future results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

employees 

as of september 25 2015 we employed approximately 57000 people worldwide of which approximately 19000 were employed in the united states and approximately 38000 were outside the united states approximately 9000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as technological obsolescence labor relations geopolitical events climate change and international operations 

risks relating to our businesses 

 general economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of certain markets that we serve demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial and residential construction capital expenditures for expansions and maintenance of industrial facilities and the amount of discretionary business and consumer spending each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality even if demand for our products is not negatively affected the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full andor on a timely basis 

much of the demand for installation of security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit commercial and residential real estate markets are prone to significant fluctuations in supply and demand in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values could lead to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors could in turn hamper demand for new fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction expensive maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could raise the cost of new debt for our customers to prohibitive levels any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we face competition in each of our businesses which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products and services if we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

we operate in competitive local and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service providers both locally and on a global basis our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from alternative service providers around the world currently key components of our competitive position are our ability to bring to market industryleading products and services to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully these factors require continuous management focus on maintaining our competitive position through technological innovation cost reduction productivity improvement and a regular appraisal of our asset portfolio if we are unable to maintain our position as a market leader or to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or costeffectiveness or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

 our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by evolving industry standards although many of our largest competitors are also global industrial companies we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products and services at lower cost than ours particularly in emerging markets or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate in a cost effective manner we have found that in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses 

accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets and to identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets adapting our businesses to serve more local markets will require us to invest considerable resources in building our distribution channels and engineering and manufacturing capabilities in those markets to ensure that we can address local customer demand even when we invest in growing our business in local markets we may not be successful for any number of reasons including competitive pressure from regional and local businesses that may have superior local capabilities or products that are produced more locally at lower cost as a result the failure to effectively adapt our products and services to the needs of local markets could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive and increasingly complex products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products and services requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance the potential for product defects product quality issues or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we rely on our global direct installation channel for a significant portion of our revenue failure to maintain and grow the installed base resulting from direct channel sales could adversely affect our business 

unlike many of our competitors we rely on a direct sales channel for a substantial portion of our revenue the direct channel provides for the installation of fire and security solutions often using products manufactured by our global products segment this represents a significant distribution channel for our global products segment creates a large installed base of tyco fire and security solutions and creates opportunities for longer term service and monitoring revenue if we are unable to maintain or grow this installation business whether due to changes in economic conditions a failure to anticipate changing customer needs a failure to introduce innovative or technologically advanced solutions or for any other reason our installation revenue could decline which could in turn adversely impact our global product pull through and our ability to grow service and monitoring revenue 

we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our installation service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances and we typically maintain product liability insurance to mitigate the risk that our products and services fail to operate as expected however in the event of litigation it is possible that contract limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable that our insurance coverage is not adequate or that insurance carriers deny coverage of our claims as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business 

our business operates and serves consumers worldwide there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 

 one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in order to manage our daytoday operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures any of which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue and certain of our costs assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar foreign currencies to which we have exposure regularly fluctuate in value relative to the us dollar which can have the effect of reducing the value of local monetary assets reduce the us dollar value of local cash flows and potentially reduce the us dollar value of future local net income although we routinely enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of the risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are a large buyer of metals and other nonmetal commodities including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory primarily using the firstin firstout method 

we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we may enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations these hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform as a result changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings these acquisitions are likely to include businesses in emerging markets which are often riskier than acquisitions in developed markets we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations moreover we may be unable to obtain strategic or operational benefits that are expected from our acquisitions any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

 a significant percentage of our future growth is anticipated to come from emerging markets and if we are unable to expand our operations in emerging markets our growth rate could be negatively affected 

one aspect of our growth strategy is to seek significant growth in emerging markets including china india latin america and the middle east through both organic investments and through acquisitions emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks than more mature markets where legal systems are more developed and familiar to us in some cases emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions are more susceptible to corruption and are locations where it may be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures and the extraterritorial laws of the united states negative or uncertain political climates and military disruptions in developing and emerging markets could also adversely affect us 

we cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful if we are unable to manage the risks inherent in our growth strategy in emerging markets including civil unrest international hostilities natural disasters security breaches and failure to maintain compliance with multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

 failure to maintain and upgrade the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and other information noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information or a violation of the companys privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in the normal course of our business we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers stockholders and employees including video and other customer data obtained in connection with monitoring and analytical services the legal regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cybercriminals around the world a significant actual or potential theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of customer stockholder employee or our data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines litigation or regulatory action against us in addition we depend on our information technology infrastructure for businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations increasingly our products and services make use of wireless technologies and are accessed through the internet and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services wirelessly or via the internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services 

failure to maintain upgrade and consolidate our information and technology networks could adversely affect us 

we are continuously upgrading and consolidating our systems including making changes to legacy systems replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality acquiring new systems with new functionality and moving to cloudbased technology solutions these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders potential disruption of our internal control structure substantial capital expenditures additional administration and operating expenses retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition the implementation of new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated 

 if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 failure to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 

our culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training motivating and developing employees and in particular we strive to attract motivate train and retain qualified engineers and managers to handle the daytoday operations of a highly diversified organization many of our manufacturing processes and many of the integrated solutions we offer are highly technical in nature our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire train and retain engineers and other technical professionals with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for resources is intense our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract retain and integrate qualified managers and engineers if we fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

 we may be required to recognize substantial impairment charges in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to assess our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets periodically to determine whether they are impaired disruptions to our business unfavorable endmarket conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in material charges for goodwill and other asset impairments we maintain significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet and we believe these balances are recoverable however fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected with the annual impairment analysis future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 our residential and commercial security businesses may experience higher rates of customer attrition which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers increasing our depreciation and amortization expense 

if our residential or commercial security customers are dissatisfied with our products or services and switch to competitive products or services or disconnect for other reasons our recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide we amortize the costs of acquired monitoring contracts and related customer relationships based on the estimated life of the customer relationships internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated if customer disconnect rates were to rise significantly we may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any 

divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 57000 people worldwide approximately 16 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works council other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

 a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we may be unable to execute on our strategic priorities 

following the spinoffs of our former north american residential and small business security business and flow control businesses in september 2012 we began implementing a multiyear strategy focused on transitioning the company from a holding company to an operating company emphasizing growth through innovation in connection with this strategic shift we anticipated certain financial operational managerial and other benefits to tyco including certain productivity and other strategic initiatives intended to reduce complexity restructure operations and leverage tyco’s scale in certain areas such as sourcing we may not be able to achieve the anticipated results of these actions on the scale that we expected and the anticipated benefits of the productivity and other strategic initiatives may not be fully realized 

we do not own the right to use the adt® brand name in the united states and canada 

as a result of the 2012 separation we own the adt® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the united states and canada and the adt corporation owns the brand name in the united states and canada although we have entered agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt® brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the united states and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the united states and canada any of these factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

 we are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to claims and lawsuits including from time to time claims for damages related to product liability and warranties litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights litigation alleging anticompetitive behavior and litigation related to employee matters wages and commercial disputes in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages furthermore we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage 

the defense of these lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of our managements attention in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies or suffer from adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install these claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability 

we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in addition if any of our products prove to be defective we may be required to recall or redesign such products which could result in significant unexpected costs any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred and our insurance carriers may deny coverage for claims made by us any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances we cannot provide assurance however that these limitations will be enforced losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws fire and security codes and standards and other laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business the loss of such licenses or the imposition of conditions to the granting or retention of such licenses could have a material adverse effect on us furthermore our systems generally must meet fire and building codes in order to be installed and it is possible that our current or future products will fail to meet such codes which could require us to make costly modifications to our products or to forgo marketing in certain jurisdictions 

changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations and laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws outside the united states 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our 

employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition 

 we may fail to satisfy international trade compliance regulations which could adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and international trade laws when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor foreign laws such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and our business prospects 

  we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries including grinnell llc “grinnell” along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials substantially all of the cases pending against affiliates of the company have been filed against grinnell and have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the company performed a revised valuation of its asbestosrelated liabilities and corresponding insurance assets and recorded a net charge of 240 million although the company’s methodology established a range of estimates of reasonably possible outcomes the company recorded its best estimate within such range based upon information known at the time as of september 25 2015 the companys estimated gross asbestos liability of 515 million  was recorded within the companys consolidated balance sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of 487 million  the amounts recorded by the company for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets are based on the companys strategies for resolving its asbestos claims currently available information and a number of estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the companys calculations vary significantly from actual results if actual liabilities are significantly higher than those recorded the cost of resolving such liabilities claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we have received notification from the united states environmental protection agency and from other environmental agencies that conditions at several sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties these projects relate to a variety of activities including 

 these projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware 

 we depend on thirdparty licenses for our products and services 

we rely on certain software technology that we license from third parties and use in our products and services to perform key functions and provide critical functionality particularly in our commercial security business because our products and services incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties we are to a certain extent dependent upon such third parties ability to maintain or enhance their current products and services to ensure that their products are free of defects or security vulnerabilities to develop new products and services on a timely and costeffective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes further these thirdparty technology licenses may not always be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all if our agreements with thirdparty vendors are not renewed or the thirdparty software fails to address the needs of our software products and services we would be required to find alternative software products and services or technologies of equal performance or functionality we cannot assure that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by thirdparty software if we lose the license to this software it becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products and services or is otherwise not adequately maintained or updated furthermore even if we obtain licenses to alternative software products or services that provide the functionality we need we may be required to replace hardware installed at our monitoring centers and at our customers sites including security system control panels and peripherals in order to effect our integration of or migration to alternative software products any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming and the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies 

police departments in a limited number of jurisdictions do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance we have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies in most cases through contracts with us which increases the overall cost to customers if more police departments whether inside or outside the us were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 

the company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the united states government 

the company’s customers include many us federal state and local government authorities doing business with the united states government and state and local authorities subjects the company to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for the companys failure to perform under the applicable contract the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which can be expensive and burdensome if the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations 

risks related to our liquidity and financial markets 

 disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us our customers and our suppliers by increasing our funding costs or reducing the availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of ordinary shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets in 2009 and 2010 credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects based on these conditions our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected 

 covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our revolving bank credit agreement contains customary financial covenants including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt in addition the indentures governing our bonds contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions 

although we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facility or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 

  

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

we estimate that our available cash our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future however material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar contingencies could require additional funding if such developments require us to obtain additional funding we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

such an outcome could have important consequences on our financial results and liquidity for example it could 

 we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial health and may decrease our profitability 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or if our cash requirements are more than we expect we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital stock the terms of the debt or capital stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity your percentage ownership in us would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed it could affect our financial health which could negatively affect your investment in us 

risks relating to tax matters 

 examinations and audits by tax authorities including the irs could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

tyco’s and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 separation we previously disclosed that in connection with us federal tax audits the irs has raised a number of issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year in particular we have been unable to resolve with the irs matters related to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions in existence prior to the 2007 separation as a result on june 20 2013 we received notices of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of our former us subsidiaries owe additional taxes of 8833 million plus penalties of 154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time in addition we received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million was asserted these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs position described below is ultimately proved correct in addition the adjustments proposed by the irs are subject to the sharing provisions of a tax sharing agreement entered in 2007 with medtronic formerly covidien plc and te connectivity the 2007 tax sharing agreement under which tyco medtronic and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos medtronics and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns if any party to the 2007 tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the 2007 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our medtronics and te connectivitys tax liabilities 

the irs asserted in the notices of deficiency that substantially all of tyco’s intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on us income tax returns totaling approximately 29 billion we strongly disagree with the irs position and have filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments a trial date has been set for october 2016 we believe that we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings that the irs positions with regard to these matters is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations and that the previously reported taxes for the years in question are appropriate furthermore we believe that tyco’s income tax reserves and the liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet for the tax sharing arrangements are appropriate however the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in particular if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion which is expected to be disallowed by the irs 

  we share responsibility for certain of our pentairs and adts income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including september 28 2012 

in connection with the 2012 separation we entered into the 2012 tax sharing agreement with pentair and adt that is separate from the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which governs the rights and obligations of tyco adt and pentair for certain tax liabilities before the distributions including tycos obligations under the 2007 tax sharing agreement under the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco pentair and adt share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to adts us tyco flow controls and tycos income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement excluding approximately 175 million of pre2012 separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 separation collectively shared tax liabilities tyco will be responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities pentair and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities tyco pentair and adt will share 525 20 and 275 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 275 and 525 by pentair adt and tyco respectively as of september 28 2012 tyco established liabilities representing the fair market value of its obligations under the 2012 tax sharing arrangement which was recorded in other liabilities within the companys consolidated balance sheet with an offset to tyco shareholders equity in addition we entered into a nonincome tax sharing agreement with adt in connection with the adt distribution to the extent we are responsible for any liability under these agreements there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that if any party were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of certain taxes that may arise as a result of the failure of the distributions to be tax free such taxes as defined in the 2012 tax sharing agreement distribution taxes each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our pentairs and adts tax liabilities 

 if the distributions or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor both adt and pentair could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco has received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distributions to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distributions will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 andor 361 of the code except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of adt common stock or of pentair common shares the private letter ruling also provides that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter ruling tyco has received an opinion from the law firm of mcdermott will  emery llp confirming the taxfree status of the distributions for us federal income tax purposes the private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us pentair and adt regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distributions or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distributions or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership which might take into account changes in pentair stock ownership resulting from the merger or asset ownership after the distributions an opinion of counsel 

represents counsels best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinions will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distributions ultimately are determined to be taxable the distributions could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to you for us federal income tax purposes and you could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the pentair common shares and the shares of adt common stock distributed to our shareholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we pentair or adt could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distributions or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distributions by us pentair or adt the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us pentair or adt as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distributions by us pentair or adt then we pentair and adt will share the liability in the manner and according to the sharing percentages set forth in the 2012 tax sharing agreement such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

legislative action in the united states could materially and adversely affect us 

taxrelated legislation 

legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the united states imposes on our worldwide operations such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the united states we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise incur business detriment 

legislation relating to governmental contracts 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company tyco is governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of tyco international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

our effective tax rate may increase 

there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate including the potential legislative actions described in these risk factors which if enacted could result in an increase in our effective tax rate additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material increase in our effective tax rate 

transfers of tyco ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of tyco ordinary shares there is no irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty is payable in respect of certain share transfers a transfer of tyco ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially is not subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of tyco ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to tyco transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases tyco may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty tyco memorandum and articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment tyco i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii may have a lien against the tyco ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in tyco ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by tyco 

dividends you receive may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we may be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders whether tyco is required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax from dividends paid to a shareholder depends largely on whether that shareholder is resident for tax purposes in a “relevant territory” a list of the “relevant territories” is included as annex c to the proxy statementprospectus related to the redomicile to ireland 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of tyco ordinary shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in tyco 

tyco shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in tyco

environmental matters 

tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 25 2015  tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 23 million  to 72 million  as of september 25 2015  tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 33 million  of which 11 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 22 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet 

the majority of the liabilities described above relate to ongoing remediation efforts at a facility in the companys global products segment located in marinette wisconsin which the company acquired in 1990 in connection with its acquisition of among other things the ansul product line prior to tycos acquisition ansul manufactured arsenicbased agricultural herbicides at the marinette facility which resulted in significant arsenic contamination of soil and groundwater on the marinette site and in parts of the adjoining menominee river ansul has been engaged in ongoing remediation efforts at the marinette site since 1990 and in february 2009 entered into an administrative consent order the consent order with the us environmental protection agency to address the presence of arsenic at the marinette site under this agreement ansuls principal obligations are to contain the arsenic contamination on the site pump and treat onsite groundwater dredge treat and properly dispose of contaminated sediments in the adjoining river areas and monitor contamination levels on an ongoing basis activities completed under the consent order since 2009 include the installation of a subsurface barrier wall around the facility to contain contaminated groundwater the installation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system and the dredging and offsite disposal of treated river sediment as of september 25 2015  the company concluded that its remaining remediation and monitoring costs related to the marinette facility were in the range of approximately 14 million  to 46 million  the companys best estimate within that range is approximately 23 million  of which 9 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 14 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet during the years ended september 25 2015  september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  the company recorded charges of nil  nil  and 100 million  respectively in selling general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statement of operations although the company has recorded its best estimate of the costs that it will incur to remediate and monitor the arsenic contamination at the marinette facility it is possible that technological regulatory or enforcement developments the results of environmental studies or other factors could change the companys expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays and such changes could be material to the companys future results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries including grinnell llc “grinnell” along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials substantially all cases pending against affiliates of the company have been filed against grinnell and have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 the company through grinnell resolved disputes with certain of its historical insurers and agreed that certain insurance proceeds would be used to establish and fund a qualified settlement fund “qsf” within the meaning of the internal revenue code which would be used for the resolution primarily of grinnell asbestos liabilities it is intended that the qsf will receive future insurance payments and proceeds from third party insurers and in addition will fund and manage liabilities for certain historical operations of the company primarily related to grinnell on january 9 2015 the company completed a series of restructuring transactions related to the establishment and funding of a dedicated structure pursuant to which a subsidiary of the company acquired the assets of grinnell and transferred cash and other assets totaling approximately 278 million  not including 22 million  received by the qsf during the quarter ended december 26 2014 from historic thirdparty insurers in settlement of coverage disputes to the structure as part of the restructuring subsidiaries in the structure assumed certain liabilities related to historic grinnell scott and figgie operations including all historical grinnell asbestos liabilities and such subsidiaries purchased additional insurance by through or from a whollyowned subsidiary in the structure in order to supplement and enhance existing insurance assets the structure and the qsf fully fund all historic grinnell asbestos liabilities and provide for the efficient and streamlined management of claims related thereto 

the company consolidates the qualified settlement fund and related entities that were established for the purpose of managing and resolving the liabilities described above although the entities in the dedicated structure serve the specific purpose of managing certain liabilities each entity in the structure is a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of the company and therefore is required to be consolidated under gaap 

as of september 25 2015  the company has determined that there were approximately 3300  claims pending against its subsidiaries primarily grinnell this amount reflects the companys current estimate of the number of viable claims made against grinnell and includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identify incorrect defendants are duplicative of other actions or for which the company is indemnified by third parties as a result of the conclusion of the yarway bankruptcy addressed separately below yarway corporation is no longer a subsidiary of the company and as of august 2015 is no longer consolidated 

as of september 25 2015  the companys estimated asbestos related net liability recorded within the companys consolidated balance sheet is 28 million  the net liability within the consolidated balance sheet is comprised of a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of 515 million  of which 23 million  is recorded in accrued and other current liabilities and 492 million  is recorded in other liabilities the company also maintains separate cash investment and other assets within the consolidated balance sheet of 487 million  of which 38 million  is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 449 million  is recorded in other assets assets include 11 million  of cash and 263 million  of investments which have all been designated as restricted the company believes that the asbestos related liabilities and insurance related assets as of september 25 2015  are appropriate as of september 26 2014  the companys estimated net liability which included claims against the companys former yarway subsidiary of 608 million  was recorded within the companys consolidated balance sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of 853 million  and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of 245 million  

the company periodically assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future asbestos claims and defense costs on a periodic basis the company through the dedicated structure referred to above evaluates actual experience regarding asbestos claims filed settled and dismissed amounts paid in settlements and the recoverability of its insurance assets if and when data from actual experience demonstrate a significant unfavorable discernible trend the company performs a valuation of its asbestos related liabilities and corresponding insurance assets including a comprehensive review of the underlying assumptions in addition the company evaluates its ability to reasonably estimate claim activity beyond its current lookforward period through 2056 in order to assess whether such period continues to be appropriate in addition to claims and litigation experience the company considers additional qualitative and quantitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment the company’s strategy in managing claims and obtaining insurance including its defense strategy and health related trends in the overall population of individuals potentially exposed to asbestos the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance assets is warranted 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the company concluded that an unfavorable trend had developed in actual claim filing activity compared to projected claim filing activity established during the company’s then most recent valuation accordingly the company with the assistance of independent actuarial service providers performed a revised valuation of its asbestosrelated liabilities and corresponding insurance assets as part of the revised valuation the company assessed whether a change in its lookforward period was appropriate taking into consideration its more extensive history and experience with asbestosrelated claims and litigation and determined that it was possible to make a reasonable estimate of the actuarially determined ultimate risk of loss for pending and unasserted potential future asbestosrelated claims through 2056 in connection with the revised valuation the company considered a recent settlement with one of its insurers calling for the establishment of a qualified settlement fund and the results of a separate independent actuarial consulting firm report conducted in the fourth quarter to assist the company in obtaining insurance to fully fund all estimable asbestosrelated claims excluding yarway claims incurred through 2056 

the independent actuarial service firm calculated a total estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims of the company which reflects the company’s best estimate of its ultimate risk of loss to resolve all pending and future claims excluding yarway claims through 2056 which is the company’s reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestosrelated claims will be filed against company affiliates 

during fiscal 2014 in conjunction with determining the total estimated liability the company retained an independent third party to assist it in valuing its insurance assets responsive to asbestosrelated claims excluding yarway claims these insurance assets represent amounts due to the company for previously settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its total liability for pending and unasserted potential future asbestos claims and defense costs in calculating this amount the company used the estimated asbestos liability for pending and projected future claims and defense costs described above and it also considered the amount of insurance available the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers resolution of insurance coverage issues gaps in coverage allocation methodologies and the terms of existing settlement agreements with insurance carriers 

as a result of the activity described above the company recorded a net charge of 240 million  in selling general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended september 26 2014 although the company’s methodology established a range of estimates of reasonably possible outcomes the company 

recorded its best estimate within such range based upon currently known information the companys estimated gross asbestos liability of 538 million  was recorded within the companys consolidated balance sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of 245 million  the aforementioned total estimated liability is on a pretax basis not discounted for the timevalue of money and includes defense costs which is consistent with the company’s historical accounting practices 

the effect of the change in the lookforward period reduced income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income in fiscal 2014 by approximately 116 million  and 71 million  respectively in addition the effect of the change decreased the companys basic income from continuing operations and net income by 016  per share and decreased the companys diluted income from continuing operations and net income by 015  per share 

the amounts recorded by the company for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets are based on the companys strategies for resolving its asbestos claims currently available information and a number of estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the companys calculations vary significantly from actual results 

yarway 

as previously disclosed on april 22 2013 yarway corporation a former indirect whollyowned subsidiary of the company filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code “chapter 11” in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware “bankruptcy court” on october 9 2014 the company reached an agreement with yarway and various representatives of asbestos claimants that held or purported to hold asbestosrelated claims against yarway to fund a section 524g trust the “yarway trust” for the resolution and payment of current and future yarway asbestos claims and to resolve the potential liability of the company each of its current and former affiliates and various other parties the “company protected parties” for pending and future derivative personal injury claims related to exposure to asbestoscontaining products that were allegedly manufactured distributed andor sold by yarway “yarway asbestos claims” as a result of the agreement to settle the company recorded a charge of 225 million in selling general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 on april 8 2015 the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming yarway’s chapter 11 plan and on july 14 2015 the united states district court for the district of delaware affirmed the bankruptcy courts confirmation order on august 19 2015 the chapter 11 plan became effective the company contributed approximately 325 million in cash to the yarway trust and each of the company protected parties received the benefit of a release from yarway and an injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code permanently enjoining the assertion of yarway asbestos claims against those parties as a result of the effectiveness of chapter 11 plan ownership of the yarway corporation was transferred to the yarway trust and it is no longer a consolidated subsidiary of the company 

as a result of the voluntary bankruptcy petition during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the company recorded an expected loss upon deconsolidation of 10 million  related to the yarway chapter 11 filing which represented the companys best estimate of loss at the time upon deconsolidation the company recorded an additional 4 million  loss which is included in selling general and administrative expenses within the companys consolidated statement of operations during the year ended september 25 2015 

tax matters 

tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to years preceding the 2007 separation the issues and proposed adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the sharing provisions of a tax sharing agreement entered in 2007 with medtronic and te connectivity the 2007 tax sharing agreement under which tyco medtronic and te connectivity share 27  42  and 31  respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos medtronics and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns the costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties tyco has previously disclosed that in connection with us federal tax audits the 

irs has raised a number of issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year although tyco has been able to resolve substantially all of the issues and adjustments proposed by the irs for tax years through 2007 it has not been able to resolve matters related to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions during the period as a result on june 20 2013 tyco received notices of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of tycos former us subsidiaries owe additional taxes of 8833 million  plus penalties of 154 million  based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time in addition tyco received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million  was asserted these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs position described below is ultimately proved correct 

the irs asserted in the notices of deficiency that substantially all of tycos intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and has disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on us income tax returns totaling approximately 29 billion  tyco strongly disagrees with the irs position and has filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments a trial date has been set for october 2016 tyco believes that it has meritorious defenses for its tax filings that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations and that the previously reported taxes for the years in question are appropriate 

no payments with respect to these matters would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on the experience of other companies could take several years tyco believes that its income tax reserves and the liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet for the tax sharing agreements continue to be appropriate however the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on tycos financial condition results of operations and cash flows in particular if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion  which is expected to be disallowed by the irs see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

other matters 

as previously disclosed simplexgrinnell lp “sg” a subsidiary of the company in the north america integrated solutions  services segment has been named as a defendant in lawsuits in several jurisdictions seeking damages for sg’s alleged failure to pay prevailing wages and for other payrelated claims through the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the company had recorded a total of approximately 17 million  in charges related to these lawsuits which was recorded in cost of services within the consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended march 27 2015 the company agreed in principle to settle all outstanding lawsuits for a total of approximately 14 million  

in addition to the foregoing the company is subject to claims and suits including from time to time contractual disputes and product and general liability claims incidental to present and former operations acquisitions and dispositions with respect to many of these claims the company either selfinsures or maintains insurance through thirdparties with varying deductibles while the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty the company believes that the resolution of any such proceedings whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows beyond amounts recorded for such matters

business overview 

we are a leading global provider of security products and services fire detection and suppression products and services and life safety products we utilize our extensive global footprint of approximately 900  locations including manufacturing facilities service and distribution centers monitoring centers and sales offices to provide solutions and localized expertise to our global customer base we provide an extensive range of product and service offerings to over 3 million customers in more than 100 countries through multiple channels our revenues are broadly diversified across the united states and canada collectively “north america” central america and south america collectively “latin america” europe the middle east and africa collectively “emea” and the asiapacific geographic areas the following chart reflects our fiscal 2015  net revenue by geographic area 

fiscal 2015  net revenue by geographic area 

our enduse customers to whom we may sell directly or through wholesalers distributors commercial builders or contractors are also broadly diversified and include 

 as a global business with a varied customer base and an extensive range of products and services our operations and results are impacted by global regional and industry specific factors and by political factors our geographic diversity and the diversity in our customer base and our products and services has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results financial condition and cash flows due to the global nature of our business and the variety of our customers products and services no single factor is predominantly used to forecast company results rather management monitors a number of factors to develop expectations regarding future results including the activity of key competitors and customers order rates for longer lead time projects and capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers we also monitor trends throughout the commercial and residential fire and security markets including building codes and firesafety standards our commercial installation businesses are impacted by trends in commercial construction starts while our residential business which is located outside of north america is impacted by new housing starts 

because we are a global business with approximately 51 of our revenue generated outside the united states and because our financial statements are prepared in us dollars our results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the year the us dollar has remained strong against the currencies of most of the significant nonus jurisdictions where we operate the most significant impact on our results has been due to the strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the euro which has unfavorably impacted our revenue and operating income during fiscal 2015 the average us dollar to euro exchange rate in fiscal 2015 was 115 as compared to 136 in fiscal 2014 assuming that the exchange rates for our principal nonus currencies the euro british pound and the canadian and australian dollars remain at current levels throughout 2016 we expect foreign currency exchange rates to unfavorably impact our gaap reported revenue and operating income during fiscal 2016 

in addition the company sells its products and services into the petrochemical oil and gas market revenue from this market vertical is spread across each of the company’s segments with the most significant exposure in the united kingdom in the row integrated solutions  services segment and in the fire protection products business in the global products segment as a result of volatility in oil prices during the year this market vertical has seen significant changes in spending patterns in particular with respect to capital expenditures the revenue tied to this market vertical has been unfavorably impacted during fiscal 2015 and we expect weakness in this sector to continue in fiscal 2016

interest expense was 102 million  in 2015  as compared to 97 million  and 100 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively the weightedaverage interest rate on total debt outstanding was 438 for fiscal 2015 and 65 for both fiscal 2014 and 2013 the increase in interest expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the net increase in debt during fiscal 2015 resulting from the various debt transactions in february and september as described above see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the debt refinancing the company expects its weighted average interest rate to be 37 for 2016 on approximately 22 billion of longterm debt see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

other expense net 

significant components of other expense net for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  are as follows 

effective income tax rate 

our effective income tax rate was 140 during the year ended september 25 2015  our effective tax rate is affected by the mix of jurisdictions in which income is earned our effective tax rate for the year was unfavorably impacted by an increase in valuation allowance when the company determined that it was morelikelythan not that a portion of our state deferred tax assets would not be realized partially offset by a reversal of valuation allowance when a tax law change in a nonus jurisdiction affected the company’s ability to determine that it was morelikelythannot that our deferred tax assets would be realized the year was favorably impacted by the increase in nonrecurring repositioning and restructuring expenses described above which were primarily incurred in high tax jurisdictions 

our effective income tax rate was 39 during the year ended september 26 2014  our effective tax rate is affected by the mix of jurisdictions in which income is earned our effective tax rate for the year was favorably impacted by asbestos related charges that generated a tax benefit in a high tax jurisdiction partially offset by a reversal of a compensation reserve established in respect of legacy litigation with former management that generated tax expense in a high tax jurisdiction 

our effective income tax rate was 180 during the year ended september 27 2013  our effective tax rate for the year was favorably impacted by taxes on the environmental remediation charges incurred during the second quarter of 2013 partially offset by tax sharing agreement adjustments incurred throughout the year and enacted tax law changes in the fourth quarter of 2013 

the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes the company has operations and a taxable presence in nearly 60 countries outside the us all of these countries have a tax rate that is lower than the rate in the us the countries in which the company has a material presence that have lower tax rates compared to the us include canada australia ireland germany switzerland and the united kingdom the companys ability to obtain a benefit from 

lower tax rates outside the us is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the us and on the statutory tax rates and tax laws in these countries based on the dispersion of the companys nonus income and management’s current assessment of the likelihood and magnitude of any potential change to statutory tax rates or tax laws affecting the company any such changes are not expected to materially affect the companys income tax provision or net income aside from any onetime adjustment to reflect the impact of the change in the tax rate to the companys deferred tax balances 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 20 billion as of both september 25 2015  and september 26 2014  respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions specifically the valuation allowance as of september 25 2015  and september 26 2014  includes separation related charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt which further increased a net operating loss carryforward which the company does not expect to realize in future periods the valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when the company determined that it was morelikelythannot that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized the company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets within the companys consolidated balance sheets 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 

equity income loss in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 

equity income loss in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries was nil in fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  and 2013  reflect our share of atkores net income or loss which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting equity income loss in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries during the years ended september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  was a gain of 206 million and loss of 48 million respectively      

on april 9 2014 atkore redeemed all of our remaining common equity stake in it for aggregate cash proceeds of 250 million we recognized a net gain of 216 million related to this transaction which was comprised of a 227 million gain on the sale of the equity investment partially offset by an 11 million loss which was our share of loss on atkores debt extinguishment undertaken in connection with the redemption see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

depreciation and amortization methods for security monitoringrelated assets —tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories internally generated residential subscriber systems outside of north america internally generated commercial subscriber systems collectively referred to as subscriber system assets and customer accounts acquired through the adt dealer program primarily outside of north america referred to as dealer intangibles subscriber system assets include installed property plant and equipment for which tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber in certain geographical areas where the company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time the company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition the company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15  years the accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 140  to 360  for commercial subscriber pools and dealer intangibles and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method the company uses a straightline method with a 14 year life for nonpooled subscriber system assets primarily in europe latin america and asia and related deferred revenue with remaining balances written off upon customer termination 

revenue recognition —contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems large security intruder systems and other constructionrelated projects are recorded primarily under the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion the risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in longterm contracts provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable 

sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements including equipment installation monitoring services and maintenance agreements we assess our revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting when ownership of the system is transferred to the customer each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery installation and customer acceptance is completed while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe or tpe is available revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the noncontingent upfront consideration received at the time of installation since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services 

product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct indirect and other market participants rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis 

loss contingencies —accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables —we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials we estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2056 which is the companys reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestosrelated claims will be filed against company affiliates periodically the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on a periodic basis the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters we record asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims in determining the amount of insurance recoverable we consider available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

insurable liabilities —the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a riskfree rate of return when the pattern and timing of the future obligation is reliably determinable the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes —in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is morelikelythannot the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairments —goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur in performing these assessments management relies on and considers a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable market transactions to the extent available other market data and the companys overall market capitalization we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

when testing for goodwill impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative fair value test is performed based upon our most recent annual impairment test completed as of june 29 2015  it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 

we recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 

indefinitelived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights are tested for impairment using either a relieffromroyalty method or excess earnings method respectively 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows 

 while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values if our assumptions are not realized it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded however it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 

longlived assets —asset groups held and used by the company including property plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairments to longlived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets the calculation of the fair value of longlived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of longlived assets there is a risk that the carrying value of our longlived assets may be overstated or understated 

pension and postretirement benefits —our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses for active plans such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average 

remaining life expectancy of participants the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately 86 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately 1 million we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class historical performance of asset classes over longterm periods asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected longterm return on plan assets a 25 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately 5 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

a fundamental objective of the company is to have sufficient liquidity balance sheet strength and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the world 

the primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations in addition we maintain a 15 billion commercial paper program backed up by a committed revolving credit facility and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources we continue to balance our operating investing and financing uses of cash through investments and acquisitions in our core businesses dividends and share repurchases in addition we believe our available cash amounts available under our credit facility commercial paper program and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational capital and other business needs in the foreseeable future to the extent it is necessary for us to finance our cash needs through the issuance of commercial paper by accessing our committed revolving credit facility or through other public or private sources our cost of funding may increase depending on market conditions at the time of such borrowing

commitments and contingencies 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies related to tax and litigation matters and governmental investigations see notes 6 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable operating leases and purchase obligations as of september 25 2015  are as follows  in millions 

 

 

the consolidated financial statements warranties see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and environmental liabilities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these obligations however the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately 29 million in 2016 and we do not expect to make any material contributions in 2016 related to other postretirement benefit plans 

as of september 25 2015  we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of 302 million and accrued interest and penalties of 40 million we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the remaining payments in future years therefore such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table however based on the current status of its income tax audits the company does not believe the unrecognized tax benefits that may be resolved in the next twelve months will be material although the company had unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate the company had net operating loss carryforwards which would offset the cash impact of any such recognition of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the current year 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in connection with the 2012 separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against tyco prior to the 2012 separation under the 2012 tax sharing agreement pentair tyco and adt share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tyco flow controls tycos and adts us income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement excluding approximately 175 million of pre2012 separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 separation collectively shared tax liabilities the company will be responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities pentair and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities pentair adt and tyco will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million the timing and amounts of these payments are subject to a number of uncertainties and could change see notes 6 and 12 respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the 2007 separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against tyco prior to the 2007 separation under the 2007 separation and distribution agreement and 2007 tax sharing agreement we have assumed 27 medtronic has assumed 42 and te connectivity has assumed 31 of certain tyco preseparation contingent and other corporate liabilities which as of september 25 2015  primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spinoffs or the distributions made or brought by any third party 

backlog 

we had a backlog of unfilled orders of 4562 million and 4857 million as of september 25 2015  and september 26 2014  respectively 

the companys backlog includes recurring revenueinforce and longterm deferred revenue for upfront fees from its na and row integrated solutions  services segments revenueinforce represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security and fire business backlog by segment was as follows  in millions 



backlog decreased 295 million or 61 to 4562 million as of september 25 2015  as compared to 4857 million in the prior year the net decrease in backlog as of september 25 2015  was driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency of 355 million or 73 primarily related to row integrated solutions  services in addition a divestiture of a business in our row integrated solutions  services segment had an unfavorable impact of 104 million or 21 these impacts were partially offset by an increase in na integrated solutions  services backlog and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of acquisitions 

guarantees 

certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of thirdparties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal year 2015 through the completion of such transactions and would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance the companys performance under the guarantees if required would not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

there are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among tyco medtronic te connectivity adt and pentair in accordance with the terms of the 2007 and 2012 separation and distribution agreements and the tax sharing agreements the guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the tax sharing agreements at the time of the 2007 and 2012 separations we recorded liabilities necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax sharing agreements in addition prior to the 2007 and 2012 separations we provided support in the form of financial andor performance guarantees to various medtronic te connectivity adt and tyco flow control operating entities to the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the 2007 and 2012 separations we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including for example unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance we record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

during the year ended september 26 2014 tyco replaced available for sale investments held as collateral for the companys insurable liabilities with letters of credit as of september 25 2015  and september 26 2014 we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately 581 million  and 662 million  respectively

nonus gaap measure 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by us gaap we also disclose the nonus gaap measure of organic revenue growth decline we believe that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented when read in conjunction with our us gaap revenue it enables investors to better evaluate our operations without giving effect to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and acquisition and divestiture activity either of which may be significant from period to period in addition organic revenue growth decline is a factor we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business this measure is not a financial measure under us gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue as determined in accordance with us gaap and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies organic revenue growth decline presented herein is defined as revenue growth decline excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations acquisitions and divestitures and other changes that may not reflect underlying results and trends our organic growth decline calculations incorporate an estimate of prior year reported net revenue associated with acquired entities that have been fully integrated within the first year and exclude prior year net revenue associated with entities that do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations which have been divested within the past year adjusted number we calculate the rate of organic 

growth decline based on the adjusted number to better reflect the rate of growth decline of the combined business in the case of acquisitions or the remaining business in the case of dispositions we base the rate of organic growth decline for acquired businesses that are not fully integrated within the first year upon unadjusted historical net revenue foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by subtracting i the us dollar equivalent of local currencies for the current period using monthly weighted average exchange rates for the prior period from ii the us dollar equivalent of local currencies for the current period using monthly weighted average exchange rates for the current period we may use organic revenue growth decline as a component of our compensation programs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of conducting business we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices accordingly we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject we seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may from time to time include forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency options interest rate swaps commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated nonfunctional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so 

we do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us we only enter into contracts with counterparties having strong investment grade longterm credit ratings from standard  poors and moodys these counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party 

foreign currency exposures 

we hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to operating entities through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts additionally for our corporate financing entities we manage the foreign currency exposure through a combination of multicurrency notional pool and forward contracts 

as of september 25 2015  and september 26 2014  the total gross notional amount of our foreign exchange contracts was 365 million  and 258 million  respectively the fair value of these derivative financial instruments and impact of such changes in the fair value was not material to the consolidated balance sheets as of september 25 2015  and september 26 2014  or consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended september 25 2015  and september 26 2014  

our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar the market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contract is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on september 25 2015  a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 3 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 3 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 

during the quarter ended march 27 2015 we designated our 2025 euro notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency and intercompany permanent loans the hedge is intended to reduce but will not eliminate the impact on our financial results of changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the currency risk related to the net investment hedge is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market exchange rates in effect on september 25 2015  a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 51 million net increase in other comprehensive income conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 62 million net decrease in other comprehensive income however these increases and decreases in other comprehensive income would be offset by decreases or increases in the hedged net investments on our balance sheet due to currency translation 

as of september 25 2015  and september 26 2014  respectively 14 billion  and 15 billion  of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature for the fiscal years ended september 25 2015  september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  we recorded a cumulative translation loss of 161 million  loss of 28 million  and gain of 3 million  respectively through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans 

interest rate exposures 

we manage interest rate risk typically by using from time to time interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes these swap transactions typically convert interest rates of fixedrate debt to variable rates since september 28 2012 tifsa has had no outstanding interest rate swaps accordingly as of september 25 2015  and september 26 2014  the total gross notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts was nil for both periods

segments 

each of our three segments serves a highly diverse customer base and none is dependent upon a single customer or group of customers for fiscal year 2014  no customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenues and approximately 47 of our revenues were derived from customers outside of north america 

our enduse customers to whom we may sell directly or through wholesalers distributors commercial builders or contractors can generally be grouped in the following categories 

 as discussed under competition below the markets in which we compete are generally highly fragmented we therefore compete with many other businesses in markets throughout the world including other large global businesses significant regional businesses and many smaller local businesses 

installation  services 

na installation  services and row installation  services collectively installation  services designs sells installs services and monitors electronic security and fire detection and suppression systems for retail commercial industrial governmental and institutional customers around the world additionally row installation  services designs sells installs services and monitors security systems for residential and small business customers under the adt brand name outside of north america 

security services 

our installation  services segments design sell install and service security systems to detect intrusion control access and react to movement fire smoke flooding environmental conditions industrial processes and other hazards these electronic security systems include detection devices that are usually connected to a monitoring center that receives and records alarm signals where security monitoring specialists verify alarm conditions and initiate a range of response scenarios for most systems control panels identify the nature of the alarm and the areas where a sensor was triggered our other security solutions include access control systems for sensitive areas such as government facilities and banks video surveillance systems designed to deter theft and fraud and help protect employees and customers and asset protection and security management systems designed to monitor and protect physical assets as well as proprietary electronic data our offerings also include antitheft systems utilizing acoustomagnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry as well as store performance solutions to enhance retailer performance many of the worlds leading retailers use our sensormatic  antitheft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft many of the products that we install for our installation  services security customers are designed and manufactured by our global products segment additionally our deep experience in designing integrating deploying and maintaining largescale security systems—including for example centrally managed security systems that span large commercial and institutional campuses—allows us to install andor service products manufactured by third parties 

purchasers of our intrusion systems typically contract for ongoing security system monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation these contracts are generally for a term of one to three years systems installed at customers premises may be owned by us or by our customers monitoring center personnel may respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to local fire or police departments notifying the customer or taking other appropriate action in certain markets we directly provide the alarm response services with highly trained and professionally equipped employees in some instances alarm systems are connected directly to local fire or police departments 

in addition our row installation  services segment is a leading provider of monitored residential and small business security systems in addition to traditional burglar alarm and fire detection systems installation and monitoring services row installation  services provides patrol and response services in select geographies including south africa our row installation  services segment continues to expand its offering of valueadded residential services worldwide such as an interactive services platform the interactive services platform allows for remote management of the home security system as well as lifestyle applications which currently include remote video lighting control and energy management 

our customers are often prompted to purchase security systems by their insurance carriers which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that a system be installed as a condition of coverage 

fire protection services 

our installation  services segments design sell install and service fire detection and fire suppression systems in both new and existing facilities commercial construction as well as legislation mandating the installation and service of fire detection and suppression systems are significant drivers of demand for our products our installation  services segments offer a wide range of fire detection and suppression systems including those designed and manufactured by our global products segment and those designed by third parties these detection systems include fire alarm control panels advanced fire alarm monitoring systems smoke and flame detection systems heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems our installation  services segments also offer a wide range of standard waterbased sprinkler and chemical suppression systems and custom designed special hazard suppression systems which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams dry chemicals and gases in addition to spill control products designed to absorb neutralize and solidify spills of hazardous materials these systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications including oil and gas power generation mining petrochemical manufacturing transportation data processing telecommunications commercial food preparation and marine applications our installation  services segments continue to focus on system maintenance and inspection which have become increasingly important parts of our business 

customers 

our installation  services customers range from fortune 500 companies with diverse worldwide operations who look to us to provide integrated global solutions for their fire and security needs to single location commercial customers and individual homeowners our installation  services customer relationships generally are in the market for new construction or retrofit projects which represented 47 of installation  services fiscal 2014  net revenue and the market for aftermarket products and services which accounted for the remaining 53 of installation  services fiscal 2014  net revenue new construction projects are inherently longlead in nature and we strive to become involved in the planning process for these projects as early as possible we believe that by actively participating in the preliminary design stages of a new construction project and by offering our design services that combine our global expertise and knowledge of local codes and standards we 

can increase our value to customers relative to many smaller local and regional competitors with respect to fire detection and suppression installations we prefer to become involved at the time an architectural or engineering design firm is selected with respect to security system design and installation we generally become involved in the later stages of a construction project or as tenants take occupancy 

our relationships with customers in the aftermarket may include any combination of alarm monitoring fire and security maintenance and or testing and inspection services we also provide aftermarket services to many customers whose fire and security systems were manufactured or installed by third parties 

global products 

our global products segment designs manufactures and sells fire protection security and life safety products including intrusion security antitheft devices breathing apparatus and access control and video management systems 

fire protection products 

fire protection products designs manufactures distributes and sells fire alarm and fire detection systems automatic fire sprinkler systems and special hazard suppression systems including many of the fire protection products that our installation  services segments install and service fire protection products also manufactures and sells grooved products for the rapid joining of piping in both the fire and nonfire markets fire protection products are marketed under various leading trade names including simplex wormald ansul and tyco  and include fire alarm control panels advanced fire alarm monitoring systems smoke heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems fire protection products also offers a wide range of waterbased sprinkler systems and custom designed special hazard suppression systems which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams dry chemicals and gases these systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications including oil and gas power generation mining petrochemical manufacturing transportation data processing telecommunications commercial food preparation and marine applications 

fire protection products systems often are purchased by facility owners through construction engineers and electrical contractors as well as mechanical or general contractors in recent years retrofitting of existing buildings has increased as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems especially in hotels restaurants healthcare facilities and educational establishments the 2009 edition of the international residential code developed by the international code council a nonprofit association that develops model codes that are the predominant building and fire safety regulations followed by state and local jurisdictions in the united states adopted a proposal advanced by firefighters and other lifesafety advocates that requires sprinkler systems in new one and twofamily homes and townhouses as of january 2011 this national code is not binding on state and local jurisdictions and must be adopted locally before it becomes mandatory for new homes being built in these areas the timing and extent of adoption if at all will vary by jurisdiction however we believe that this development may offer opportunities to expand our residential fire suppression business in the united states 

security products 

security products designs and manufactures a wide array of electronic security products including integrated video surveillance and access control systems to enable businesses to manage their security and enhance business performance our global access control solutions include integrated security management systems for enterprise applications access control solutions applications alarm management panels door controllers readers keypads and cards our global video system solutions include digital video management systems matrix switchers and controllers digital multiplexers programmable cameras monitors and liquid crystal interactive displays our security products for homes and businesses range from basic burglar alarms to comprehensive interactive security systems including alarm control panels keypads sensors and central station receiving equipment used in security monitoring centers our offerings also include antitheft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry our security products are marketed under various leading trade names including software house dsc american dynamics sensormatic visonic and exacq  many of the worlds leading retailers use our sensormatic  antitheft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft security products manufactures many of the security products that our installation  services business installs and services 

life safety products 

life safety products manufactures life safety products including selfcontained breathing apparatus designed for firefighter industrial and military use supplied air respirators airpurifying respirators thermal imaging cameras gas detection equipment gas masks and personal protection equipment the life safety products business operates under various leading trade names including scott safety  and protector  our breathing apparatus are used by the military forces of several countries and many us firefighters rely on the scott airpak  brand of selfcontained breathing apparatus 

customers 

global products sells products through our installation  service segments and indirect distribution channels around the world some of global products channel business partners act as dealers selling to smaller fire and security contractors that install fire detection and suppression security and theft protection systems whereas others act as integrators that install the products themselves builders contractors and developers are customers for our sprinkler products end customers for our breathing apparatus and related products include fire departments municipal and state governments and military forces as well as major companies in the industrial sector 

competition 

the markets that we serve are generally highly competitive and fragmented with a small number of large global firms and thousands of smaller regional and local companies competition is based on price specialized product capacity breadth of product line training support and delivery with the relative importance of these factors varying depending on the project complexity product line the local market and other factors rather than compete primarily on price we emphasize the quality of our products and services the reputation of our brands and our knowledge of customers fire and security needs among large industrial commercial governmental and institutional customers we believe that our comprehensive global coverage and product and service offerings provide a competitive advantage we also believe that our systems integration capabilities which allow us to offer global solutions to customers that fully integrate our security andor fire offerings into existing information technology networks business operations and management tools and process automation and control systems set us apart from all but a small number of other large global competitors 

competitive dynamics in the fire and security industry generally result in more direct competition and lower margins for installation projects compared to aftermarket products and services we generally face the greatest competitive pricing pressure for the installation of products that have become more commoditized over time including standard commercial sprinkler systems and closedcircuit television systems 

backlog 

see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information relating to our backlog 

intellectual property 

patents trademarks copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including trademarks patents and patent applications in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and misappropriation of our proprietary rights and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to electronic security products and systems for intrusion detection access control electronic identification tags  video surveillance fire protection products and systems including fire detection and fire suppression with chemical gas foam and water agents personal protective products and systems for fire and other hazards we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks 

while we consider our patents to be valuable assets that help prevent or delay the commoditization of our products and thus extend their life cycles we do not believe that our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents we share the adt® trademark with adt and operate under a brand governance agreement between the two companies 

research and development 

we are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate for example in order to position ourselves to participate in and lead the development of residential interactive platforms enterprisewide integrated access control platforms and transition ip video platforms we have made significant investments in our security products portfolio in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment our research and development expense was  193 million  in 2014   172 million in 2013  and  145 million in 2012  related to new product development 

raw and other purchased materials 

we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including fuel for our vehicle fleet we purchase materials from a large number of independent sources around the world and have experienced no shortages that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses we enter into longterm supply contracts using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions significant changes in certain raw material including steel brass and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression agents may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the united states in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states and nonus jurisdictions in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries our security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals wireline and wireless telephone companies in the united states are regulated by the federal and state governments in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our fire businesses these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations both favorably and unfavorably for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors—risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

environmental matters 

we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 26 2014  we concluded that it was probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 38 million  to 79 million  as of september 26 2014  tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 42 million  of which 23 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and accounts payable and 19 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet 

the majority of the liabilities described above relate to ongoing remediation efforts at a facility in the companys global products segment located in marinette wisconsin which the company acquired in 1990 in connection with its acquisition of among other things the ansul product line prior to tycos acquisition ansul manufactured arsenicbased agricultural herbicides at the marinette facility which resulted in significant arsenic contamination of soil and groundwater on the marinette site and in parts of the adjoining menominee river ansul has been engaged in ongoing remediation efforts at the marinette site since 1990 and in february 2009 entered into an administrative consent order the consent order with the us environmental protection agency to address the presence of arsenic at the marinette site under this agreement ansuls principal obligations are to contain the arsenic contamination on the site pump and treat onsite groundwater dredge treat and properly dispose of contaminated sediments in the adjoining river areas and monitor contamination levels on an ongoing basis activities completed under the consent order since 2009 include the installation of a subsurface barrier wall around the facility to contain contaminated groundwater the installation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system and the dredging and offsite disposal of treated river sediment as of september 26 2014  the company concluded that its remaining remediation and monitoring costs related to the marinette facility were in the range of approximately 27 million  to 54 million  the companys best estimate within that range is approximately 30 million  of which 18 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 12 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet during the years ended september 26 2014 september 27 2013 and september 28 2012 the company recorded charges of nil 100 million and 17 million respectively in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations although the company has recorded its best estimate of the costs that it will incur to remediate and monitor the arsenic contamination at the marinette facility it is possible that technological regulatory or enforcement developments the results of environmental studies or other factors could change the companys expectations with respect to future charges and 

cash outlays and such changes could be material to the companys future results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

employees 

as of september 26 2014  we employed approximately 57000  people worldwide of which approximately 20000  were employed in the united states and approximately 37000  were outside the united states approximately 8000  employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as technological obsolescence labor relations geopolitical events climate change and international operations 

risks relating to our businesses 

 general economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of certain markets that we serve for example demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial and residential construction industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance and the amount of discretionary business and consumer spending each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality even if demand for our products is not negatively affected the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full andor on a timely basis 

much of the demand for installation of security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit in recent years many commercial and residential real estate markets have experienced significant fluctuations in supply and demand and this volatility may continue indefinitely in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing from banks and other institutional lenders in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values in many parts of the world have led to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors have in turn hampered demand for new fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction expensive maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could raise the cost of new debt for our customers to prohibitive levels any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue including tax receipts general obligation and construction bonds endowments and donations have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we face competition in each of our businesses which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products and services if we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

we operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service providers both domestically and on a global basis our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from alternative service providers around the world currently key components of our competitive position are our ability to bring to market industryleading products and services to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully these factors require continuous management focus on maintaining our competitive position through technological innovation cost reduction productivity improvement and a regular appraisal of our asset portfolio if we are unable to maintain our position as a market leader or to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or costeffectiveness or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

 our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by evolving industry standards although many of our largest competitors are also global industrial companies we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products and services at lower cost than ours particularly in emerging markets or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate we have found that in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses 

accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive products and services to market quickly and costeffectively adapting our businesses to serve more local markets will require us to invest considerable resources in building our distribution channels and engineering and manufacturing capabilities in those markets to ensure that we can address customer demand even when we invest in growing our business in local markets we may not be successful for any number of reasons including competitive pressure from regional and local businesses that may have superior local capabilities or products that are produced more locally at lower cost our ability to develop or acquire new products and services can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use 

which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand images could suffer in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure to effectively adapt our products and services to the needs of local markets the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance the potential for product defects or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our installation service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances and we typically maintain product liability insurance to mitigate the risk that our products and services fail to operate as expected however in the event of litigation with respect to such matters it is possible that contract limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable that our insurance coverage is not adequate or that insurance carriers deny coverage of our claims as a result such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business 

our business operates and serves consumers worldwide there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in order to manage our daytoday operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures any of which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue and certain of our costs assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure have undergone significant devaluation in the past which can reduce the value of our local monetary assets reduce the us dollar value of our local cash flow and potentially reduce the us dollar value of future local net income although we intend to enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of our risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are a large buyer of metals and other nonmetal commodities including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method 

we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we may enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations these hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform as a result changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings these acquisitions are likely to include businesses in emerging markets which are often riskier than acquisitions in developed markets we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations moreover we may be unable to obtain strategic or operational benefits that are expected from our acquisitions any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

 a significant percentage of our future growth is anticipated to come from emerging markets and if we are unable to expand our operations in emerging markets our growth rate could be negatively affected 

one aspect of our growth strategy is to seek significant growth in emerging markets including china india latin america and the middle east through both organic investments and through acquisitions emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks than more mature markets where legal systems are more developed and familiar to us in some cases emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions are more susceptible to corruption and are locations where it may be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures and the extraterritorial laws of the united states negative or uncertain political climates and military disruptions in developing and emerging markets could also adversely affect us 

we cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful if we are unable to manage the risks inherent in our growth strategy in emerging markets including civil unrest international hostilities natural disasters security breaches and failure to maintain compliance with multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

 failure to maintain and upgrade the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and other information noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information or a violation of the companys privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in the normal course of our business we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers stockholders and employees including video and other customer data obtained in connection with monitoring and analytical services the legal regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cybercriminals around the world a significant actual or potential theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of customer stockholder employee or our data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines litigation or regulatory action against us in addition we depend on our information technology infrastructure for businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations increasingly our security products and services are accessed wirelessly and through the internet and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services wirelessly or via the internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services 

failure to maintain upgrade and consolidate our information and technology networks could adversely affect us 

we are continuously upgrading and consolidating our systems including making changes to legacy systems replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality acquiring new systems with new functionality and moving to cloudbased technology solutions these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders potential disruption of our internal control structure substantial capital expenditures additional administration and operating expenses retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition the implementation of new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated 

 if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 failure to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 

our culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training motivating and developing employees and in particular we strive to attract motivate train and retain qualified engineers and managers to handle the daytoday operations of a highly diversified organization many of our manufacturing processes and many of the integrated solutions we offer are highly technical in nature our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire train and retain engineers and other technical professionals with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for resources is intense our geographic expansion strategy in emerging 

markets depends on our ability to attract retain and integrate qualified managers and engineers if we fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

 we may be required to recognize substantial impairment charges in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to assess our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets periodically to determine whether they are impaired disruptions to our business unfavorable endmarket conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in material charges for goodwill and other asset impairments we maintain significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet and we believe these balances are recoverable however fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected with the annual impairment analysis future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 our residential and commercial security businesses may experience higher rates of customer attrition which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers increasing our depreciation and amortization expense 

if our residential or commercial security customers are dissatisfied with our products or services and switch to competitive products or services or disconnect for other reasons our recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide we amortize the costs of acquired monitoring contracts and related customer relationships based on the estimated life of the customer relationships internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated if customer disconnect rates were to rise significantly we may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ over 57000 people worldwide approximately 14 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works council other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

 a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill 

customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we may be unable to execute on our strategic priorities 

in connection with the spinoffs of our former north american residential and small business security business and flow control businesses in september 2012 we anticipated certain financial operational managerial and other benefits to tyco and in particular we commenced certain productivity and other strategic initiatives following the spinoffs intended to reduce complexity restructure operations and leverage tyco’s scale in certain areas such as sourcing we may not be able to achieve the anticipated results of these actions on the scale that we expected and the anticipated benefits of the spinoffs and the productivity and other strategic initiatives may not be fully realized 

 we and adt have entered into noncompete and nonsolicit restrictions that prohibited us from competing with adt in the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada and prohibited adt from competing with us in the commercial fire and security businesses in each case until september 29 2014 

the noncompete provisions included in the adt separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs have expired these provisions i prohibited us from competing with adt in the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada and ii prohibited adt from competing with tyco in the commercial fire and security businesses subject to certain small business related exceptions in each case until september 29 2014 in addition the adt separation and distribution agreement contains nonsolicitation provisions that prevented i us from soliciting adt’s residential small business customers in the united states and canada and ii adt from soliciting our security customers in each case until september 29 2014 these provisions effectively prevented us from expanding into adt’s business and adt from expanding into our business in these jurisdictions until september 29 2014 because these restrictions have expired adt is no longer contractually prohibited from competing with us for commercial security customers especially smaller businesses adt has begun to compete with us and if it is successful in this regard it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results and operations and cash flows 

 in connection with the 2012 separation we rebranded our north american commercial security business to tyco integrated security and we no longer own the right to use the adt ®  brand name in the united states and canada 

prior to the spinoff of adt in september 2012 we rebranded our north american commercial security business to tyco integrated security there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve name recognition or status under our new brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed the failure of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers resulting in reduced revenues in addition as a result of the spinoffs we own the adt ®  brand name in jurisdictions outside of the united states and canada and adt owns the brand name in the united states and canada although we have entered agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt ®  brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the united states and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt ®  brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the united states and canada any of these factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

 we are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to claims and lawsuits including from time to time claims for damages related to product liability and warranties litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights litigation alleging anticompetitive behavior and litigation related to employee matters wages and commercial disputes in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages furthermore we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage the defense of these lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of our managements attention in addition we 

may be required to pay damage awards or settlements become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies or suffer from adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install these claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability 

we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in addition if any of our products prove to be defective we may be required to recall or redesign such products which could result in significant unexpected costs any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred and our insurance carriers may deny coverage for claims made by us any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances we cannot provide assurance however that these limitations will be enforced losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 our businesses operate in regulated industries and are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws fire and security codes and standards and other laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business the loss of such licenses or the imposition of conditions to the granting or retention of such licenses could have a material adverse effect on us furthermore our systems generally must meet fire and building codes in order to be installed and it is possible that our current or future products will fail to meet such codes which could require us to make costly modifications to our products or to forgo marketing in certain jurisdictions 

changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations and laws regulating the foreign ownership of assets no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

 we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws outside the united states 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the us securities and exchange commission sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti 

corruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition 

furthermore in september 2012 we agreed to the settlement of charges related to alleged fcpa violations with the doj and sec in connection with the settlement we entered into a consent agreement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj and a subsidiary of ours which is no longer part of tyco as a result of the 2012 separation pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the fcpa pursuant to the threeyear nonprosecution agreement we have acknowledged that a number of our subsidiaries made payments both directly and indirectly to government officials in order to obtain and retain business with private and stateowned entities and falsely described the payments in the subsidiaries books records and accounts the nonprosecution agreement also acknowledges tycos timely voluntary and complete disclosure to the doj and our cooperation with the dojs investigationincluding a global internal investigation concerning bribery and related misconductand extensive remediation under the nonprosecution and other agreements we have agreed to cooperate with and report periodically to the doj and other governmental authorities on matters related to our compliance efforts including informing the doj when we become aware of possible violations of the fcpa as a result of our global audit program and to continue to implement an enhanced compliance program and internal controls designed to prevent and detect fcpa violations notwithstanding our settlement of the doj and sec investigations we may be subject to allegations of fcpa violations in the future and we may be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of these compliance matters if so or if we are unable to comply with the provisions of the nonprosecution and other agreements we may be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the doj or sec in such a case we could be subject to material fines injunctions on future conduct the imposition of a compliance monitor or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and international trade laws when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor foreign laws such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and our business prospects 

  we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries including yarway corporation “yarway” and grinnell llc “grinnell” along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials over 90 of cases pending against affiliates of the company have been filed against yarway or grinnell and have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components claims filed against yarway derive from yarway’s purported use of asbestoscontaining gaskets and packing in the sale or distribution of steam valves and traps and from its alleged manufacture of asbestoscontaining expansion joint packing yarway’s alleged manufacture distribution andor sale of asbestoscontaining materials ceased by 1988 and yarway ceased substantially all of its manufacturing distribution and sales operations in 2003 claims filed against grinnell typically allege that it manufactured sold or distributed valves gaskets piping and sprinkler systems containing asbestos 

on april 22 2013 yarway filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code “chapter 11” in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware “bankruptcy court” and on october 9 2014 the company reached an agreement in principle with yarway and the representatives of current and future yarway asbestos claimants to fund a section 524g trust for the resolution and payment of current and future yarway asbestos claims under the chapter 11 plan to implement the trust an asbestos settlement trust the “yarway trust” that conforms to the provisions of section 524g of the us bankruptcy code will be established and on the effective date of the chapter 11 plan the company and yarway will contribute to the yarway trust a total of 325 million in cash “settlement consideration” in exchange for the settlement consideration the company and its affiliates will receive the benefit of a release from yarway and an injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code permanently enjoining the assertion of yarway asbestos claims against those parties the agreement in principle is subject among other things to the negotiation and filing of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization for yarway incorporating the terms of such agreement the “plan” acceptance of the plan by at least 75 of 

yarway’s current asbestos claimants voting on such plan confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court and approval of the injunction in favor of the company and its affiliates by the united states district court for the district of delaware “district court” although the company has agreed in principle to the terms of the plan with representatives of current and future yarway asbestos claimants there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to implementation of the plan will be met or that the final plan will reflect all of the terms agreed to in principle if the plan were not implemented in accordance with the terms agreed in principle the company and its affiliates may not receive the benefit of the injunction described above and the relief ultimately granted by the bankruptcy court may not be satisfactory to yarway the company or its affiliates a failure to obtain satisfactory relief could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the company performed a revised valuation of its nonyarway asbestosrelated liabilities and corresponding insurance assets and recorded a net charge excluding yarway of 240 million although the company’s methodology established a range of estimates of reasonably possible outcomes the company recorded its best estimate within such range based upon information known at the time the companys estimated gross asbestos liability excluding yarway of 538 million was recorded within the companys consolidated balance sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of 245 million the amounts recorded by the company for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets are based on the companys strategies for resolving its asbestos claims currently available information and a number of estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the companys calculations vary significantly from actual results if actual liabilities are significantly higher than those recorded the cost of resolving such liabilities claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we have received notification from the united states environmental protection agency and from other environmental agencies that conditions at several sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties these projects relate to a variety of activities including 

 these projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware 

 we depend on thirdparty licenses for our products and services 

we rely on certain software technology that we license from third parties and use in our products and services to perform key functions and provide critical functionality particularly in our commercial security business because our products and services incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties we are to a certain extent dependent upon such third parties ability to maintain or enhance their current products and services to ensure that their products are free of defects or security vulnerabilities to develop new products and services on a timely and costeffective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes further these thirdparty technology licenses may not always be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all if our agreements with thirdparty vendors are not renewed or the thirdparty software fails to address the needs of our software products and services we would be required to find alternative software products and services or technologies of equal performance or functionality we cannot assure that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by thirdparty software if we lose the license to this software it becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products and services or is otherwise not adequately maintained or updated furthermore even if we obtain licenses to alternative software products or services that provide the functionality we need we may be required to replace hardware installed at our monitoring centers and at our customers sites including security system control panels and peripherals in order to effect our integration of or migration to alternative software products any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming and the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies 

police departments in a limited number of jurisdictions do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance we have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies in most cases through contracts with us which increases the overall cost to customers if more police departments whether inside or outside the us were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 

the company may be subject to risks arising from regulations applicable to companies doing business with the united states government 

the company’s customers include many federal state and local government authorities doing business with the united states government and state and local authorities subjects the company to unusual risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification either at the convenience of the government or for the companys failure to perform under the applicable contract the company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations if 

the company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations 

risks related to our liquidity and financial markets 

 disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us our customers and our suppliers by increasing our funding costs or reducing the availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of common shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets in 2009 and 2010 credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects based on these conditions our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected 

 covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit agreements contain customary financial covenants including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt in addition the indentures governing our bonds contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions 

although we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 

 material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

we estimate that our available cash our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future however material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar contingencies could require additional funding if such developments require us to obtain additional funding we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

such an outcome could have important consequences to you for example it could 

 

 we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial health and may decrease our profitability 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or if our cash requirements are more than we expect we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital stock the terms of the debt or capital stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity your percentage ownership in us would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed it could affect our financial health which could negatively affect your investment in us 

risks relating to tax matters 

 examinations and audits by tax authorities including the irs could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

tyco’s and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 separation we previously disclosed that in connection with us federal tax audits the irs has raised a number of issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year in particular we have been unable to resolve with the irs matters related to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions in existence prior to the 2007 separation as a result on june 20 2013 we received notices of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of our former us subsidiaries owe additional taxes of 8833 million plus penalties of 154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time in addition we received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million is expected to be asserted these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs position described below is ultimately proved correct in addition the adjustments proposed by the irs are subject to the sharing provisions of a tax sharing agreement entered in 2007 with covidien and te connectivity the 2007 tax sharing agreement under which tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns 

the irs asserted in the notices of deficiency that substantially all of tyco’s intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on us income tax returns totaling approximately 29 billion we strongly disagree with the irs position and have filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments a trial date has been set for february 2016 we believe that we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings that the irs positions with regard to these matters is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations and that the previously reported taxes for the years in question are appropriate furthermore we believe that tyco’s income tax reserves and the liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for the tax sharing arrangements are appropriate however the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in particular if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion which is expected to be disallowed by the irs 

 we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and te connectivitys income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including june 29 2007 

in connection with the 2007 separation tyco entered into the 2007 tax sharing agreement which governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre2007 separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 separation as noted above tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 separation in the event the 2007 separation or certain related transactions is determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 separation by tyco covidien or te connectivity the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on tyco covidien or te connectivity as a result thereof if none of the companies is responsible for such failure then tyco covidien and te connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the 

same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 tax sharing agreement costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties 

if any party to the 2007 tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the 2007 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our covidiens and te connectivitys tax liabilities 

 we share responsibility for certain of our pentairs and adts income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with the distributions we entered into the 2012 tax sharing agreement with pentair and adt that is separate from the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which governs the rights and obligations of tyco adt and pentair for certain tax liabilities before the distributions including tycos obligations under the 2007 tax sharing agreement under the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco pentair and adt share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to adts us tyco flow controls and tycos income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement excluding approximately 175 million of pre2012 separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 separation collectively shared tax liabilities tyco will be responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities pentair and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities tyco pentair and adt will share 525 20 and 275 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 275 and 525 by pentair adt and tyco respectively as of september 28 2012 tyco established liabilities representing the fair market value of its obligations under the 2012 tax sharing arrangement which is recorded in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet with an offset to tyco shareholders equity in addition we entered into a nonincome tax sharing agreement with adt in connection with the adt distribution to the extent we are responsible for any liability under these agreements there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that if any party were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of certain taxes that may arise as a result of the failure of the distributions to be tax free such taxes as defined in the 2012 tax sharing agreement distribution taxes each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our pentairs and adts tax liabilities 

 if the distributions or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor both adt and pentair could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco has received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distributions to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distributions will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 andor 361 of the code except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of adt common stock or of pentair common shares the private letter ruling also provides that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter ruling tyco has received an opinion from the law firm of mcdermott will  emery llp confirming the taxfree status of the distributions for us federal income tax purposes the private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us pentair and adt regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distributions or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distributions or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership which might take into account changes in pentair stock ownership resulting from the merger or asset ownership after the distributions an opinion of counsel represents counsels best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinions will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with 

retroactive effect if the distributions ultimately are determined to be taxable the distributions could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to you for us federal income tax purposes and you could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the pentair common shares and the shares of adt common stock distributed to our shareholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we pentair or adt could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distributions or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distributions by us pentair or adt the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us pentair or adt as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distributions by us pentair or adt then we pentair and adt will share the liability in the manner and according to the sharing percentages set forth in the 2012 tax sharing agreement such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances as a result of the distributions because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted as a result of the distributions in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distributions even if the distributions otherwise qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporatelevel gain to tyco and certain of its affiliates under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares pentairs shares or adts shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distributions any acquisitions or issuances of our shares pentairs shares or adts shares within two years after the distributions generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan although we pentair or adt may be able to rebut that presumption 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to us of the distributions under the 2012 tax sharing agreement that we entered with pentair and adt we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distributions and related transactions from being taxfree these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business moreover the 2012 tax sharing agreement also provides that we will be responsible for any taxes imposed on pentair or any of its affiliates or on adt or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distributions or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distributions by or in respect of us any of our affiliates or our shareholders 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

the anticipated benefits of our change in jurisdiction of incorporation may not be realized 

at a special general meeting held on september 9 2014 our shareholders approved a merger agreement dated may 30 2014 between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland as described in more detail in the proxy statement  prospectus mailed to shareholders on august 1 2014 related to the merger we expect this merger to close in november 2014 we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the merger and our failure to realize those benefits could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

legislative action in the united states could materially and adversely affect us 

taxrelated legislation 

legislative action may be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could limit the availability of tax benefits or deductions that we currently claim override tax treaties upon which we rely or otherwise affect the taxes that the united states imposes on our worldwide operations such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate andor require us to take further action at potentially significant expense to seek to preserve our effective tax rate in addition if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding or limiting our ability currently as a swiss company and in the near future as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the united states we could incur additional tax expense andor otherwise incur business detriment 

  

legislation relating to governmental contracts 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

your rights as a shareholder will change as a result of the merger 

the completion of the merger between the company and tyco ireland will change the governing law that applies to our shareholders from swiss law which applies to the company and its common shares to irish law which applies to tyco ireland and its ordinary shares many of the principal attributes of tyco international ltd common shares and tyco ireland ordinary shares will be materially similar however when the merger is completed your future rights as a shareholder under irish corporate law will differ from your current rights as a shareholder under swiss corporate law in addition tyco ireland’s proposed articles of association will differ from tyco international ltd’s articles of association and organizational regulations see “comparison of rights of shareholders” in the proxy statement  prospectus related to the merger for more details 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company tyco ireland will be governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of tyco international plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

our effective tax rate may increase 

although we expect that the merger between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland will not have a material effect on our worldwide effective tax rate there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate including the potential legislative actions described in these risk factors and our effective tax rate may increase additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material increase in our effective tax rate 

tyco ireland will seek irish high court approval of the creation of distributable reserves tyco ireland expects this will be forthcoming but cannot guarantee this 

under irish law dividends may only be paid and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded out of “distributable reserves” which tyco ireland will not have immediately following the closing of the merger between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland the creation of distributable reserves of tyco ireland by way of a capital reduction of tyco ireland requires the approval of the irish high court the approval of the irish high court is expected within approximately six to twelve weeks following the closing of the merger between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland we are not aware of any reason why the irish high court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves however the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the irish high court approval of the creation of distributable reserves by the irish high court may also take substantially longer than we anticipate in the event that distributable reserves of tyco ireland are not created no distributions by way of dividends share repurchases or otherwise will be permitted under irish law until such time as the group has created sufficient distributable reserves from its trading activities 

transfers of tyco ireland ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of tyco ireland ordinary shares there will not be any irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty will become payable in respect of certain share transfers occurring after completion of the merger between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland a transfer of tyco ireland ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie 

through dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially will not be subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of tyco ireland ordinary shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through dtc without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to tyco ireland’s transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer there is no agreement in place for a sale of the shares 

because of the potential irish stamp duty on transfers of tyco ireland ordinary shares we strongly recommend that all directly registered tyco international ltd shareholders open broker accounts so they can transfer their shares into a broker account as soon as possible and in any event prior to completion of the merger with tyco ireland we also strongly recommend that any person who wishes to acquire tyco ireland ordinary shares after completion of the merger acquire such shares as a beneficial holder 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases tyco ireland may in its absolute discretion pay or cause one of its affiliates to pay any stamp duty tyco ireland’s memorandum and articles of association as they will be in effect after the merger provide that in the event of any such payment tyco ireland i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii may have a lien against the tyco ireland ordinary shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in tyco ireland ordinary shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by tyco ireland 

dividends you receive may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances as an irish tax resident company we may be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders whether tyco ireland will be required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax from dividends paid to a shareholder will depend largely on whether that shareholder is resident for tax purposes in a “relevant territory” a list of the “relevant territories” is included as annex c to the proxy statementprospectus related to the merger between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland 

dividends received by you could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of tyco ireland’s ordinary shares generally will not be subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in tyco ireland 

tyco ireland shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax generally will have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in tyco 

if tyco ireland ordinary shares are not eligible for deposit and clearing within the facilities of dtc then transactions in tyco ireland’s securities may be disrupted 

the facilities of dtc are a widelyused mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the dtc system which include many large banks and brokerage firms upon the completion of the merger between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland tyco ireland ordinary shares will be eligible for deposit and clearing within the dtc system tyco ireland has entered into arrangements with dtc whereby tyco ireland will agree to indemnify dtc for any stamp duty that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for tyco ireland’s ordinary shares 

dtc is not obligated to accept tyco ireland ordinary shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities at the closing and even if dtc does initially accept tyco ireland ordinary shares it will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for tyco ireland ordinary shares if dtc determines at any time after the completion of the merger that tyco ireland ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe tyco ireland ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a us securities exchange or inclusion in the standard  poor’s 500 index and trading in tyco ireland ordinary shares would be disrupted while tyco ireland would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve its listing and maintain trading any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the tyco ireland ordinary shares

 item 3 legal proceedings 

legacy matters related to former management 

the company has been a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management including its former chief executive officer mr l dennis kozlowski and its former chief financial officer mr mark swartz the company filed civil complaints against mr kozlowski and mr swartz for breach of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct relating to alleged abuses of the companys key employee loan program and relocation program unauthorized bonuses unauthorized payments selfdealing transactions and other improper conduct in connection with tycos affirmative actions against mr kozlowski and mr swartz mr kozlowski through counterclaims and mr swartz through a separate lawsuit sought an aggregate of approximately 140 million  allegedly due in connection with their compensation and retention arrangements and under the employee retirement income security act erisa 

with respect to mr kozlowski in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the parties signed an agreement resolving all outstanding disputes with mr kozlowski and with mr kozlowski agreeing to release the company from any claims to monetary amounts related to compensation retention or other arrangements including the key employee loan program that were alleged to have existed between him and the company as a result in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the company reversed the net liability of approximately 92 million  which was recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the amounts allegedly due to him additionally the company will be entitled to a portion of the proceeds if any from the future sale of certain assets owned by mr kozlowski the timing and amount of which is uncertain at this time during the quarter ended june 27 2014 the company received a 4 million recovery from the sale of property owned by mr kozlowski which was recognized as a reduction to selling general and administrative expenses 

with respect to mr swartz during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 the company reversed a 50 million liability related to mr swartzs pay and benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and in july 2013 the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve the matter with mr swartz agreeing to release the company from any claims to monetary 

amounts related to compensation retention or other arrangements alleged to have existed between him and the company in november 2014 the parties executed a definitive settlement agreement and the company received approximately 12 million in cash from mr swartz a portion of which will be shared with the members of the class action settlement 

environmental matters 

tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 26 2014  tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 38 million  to 79 million  as of september 26 2014  tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 42 million  of which 23 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and accounts payable and 19 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet 

the majority of the liabilities described above relate to ongoing remediation efforts at a facility in the companys global products segment located in marinette wisconsin which the company acquired in 1990 in connection with its acquisition of among other things the ansul product line prior to tycos acquisition ansul manufactured arsenicbased agricultural herbicides at the marinette facility which resulted in significant arsenic contamination of soil and groundwater on the marinette site and in parts of the adjoining menominee river ansul has been engaged in ongoing remediation efforts at the marinette site since 1990 and in february 2009 entered into an administrative consent order the consent order with the us environmental protection agency to address the presence of arsenic at the marinette site under this agreement ansuls principal obligations are to contain the arsenic contamination on the site pump and treat onsite groundwater dredge treat and properly dispose of contaminated sediments in the adjoining river areas and monitor contamination levels on an ongoing basis activities completed under the consent order since 2009 include the installation of a subsurface barrier wall around the facility to contain contaminated groundwater the installation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system and the dredging and offsite disposal of treated river sediment as of september 26 2014  the company concluded that its remaining remediation and monitoring costs related to the marinette facility were in the range of approximately 27 million  to 54 million  the companys best estimate within that range is approximately 30 million  of which 18 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 12 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet during the years ended september 26 2014 september 27 2013 and september 28 2012 the company recorded nil 100 million and 17 million of charges respectively in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations although the company has recorded its best estimate of the costs that it will incur to remediate and monitor the arsenic contamination at the marinette facility it is possible that technological regulatory or enforcement developments the results of environmental studies or other factors could change the companys expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays and such changes could be material to the companys future results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries including yarway corporation “yarway” and grinnell llc “grinnell” along with numerous other third parties are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials over 90 of cases pending against affiliates of the company have been filed against yarway or grinnell and have typically involved product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were used with asbestos containing components claims filed against yarway derive from yarway’s purported use of asbestoscontaining gaskets and packing in the sale or distribution of steam valves and traps and from its alleged manufacture of asbestoscontaining expansion joint packing yarway’s alleged manufacture distribution andor sale of asbestoscontaining materials ceased by 1988 and yarway ceased substantially all of its manufacturing distribution and sales operations in 2003 claims filed against grinnell typically allege that it manufactured sold or distributed valves gaskets piping and sprinkler systems containing asbestos 

as of september 26 2014 the company has determined that there were approximately 5600 claims pending against it which includes approximately 3200 claims pending against yarway this amount reflects the companys current estimate of the number of viable claims made against it and includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identify incorrect defendants are duplicative of other actions or for which the company is indemnified by third parties additionally as a result of the yarway bankruptcy filing described below claims against yarway have been stayed since april 2013 

the following table summarizes the activity in the asset and liability accounts related to these asbestos matters for the year ended september 26 2014  in millions 



yarway 

as previously disclosed on april 22 2013 yarway filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code “chapter 11” in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware “bankruptcy court” as a result of this filing the continuation or commencement of asbestosrelated litigation against yarway has been enjoined by the automatic stay imposed by the us bankruptcy code yarways goal has been to negotiate obtain approval of and consummate a plan of reorganization that establishes a trust to fairly and equitably value and pay current and future yarway asbestos claims and that in exchange for funding of the trust by the company andor its subsidiaries provides permanent injunctive relief protecting the company each of its current and former affiliates and various other parties the “company protected parties” from any further asbestos claims based on products manufactured sold andor distributed by yarway on october 9 2014 the company reached an agreement in principle with yarway the official committee of asbestos claimants “acc” appointed in the yarway chapter 11 case as the representative of current yarway asbestos claimants and the future claimants representative “fcr” appointed in the yarway chapter 11 case as the representative of future yarway asbestos claimants to fund a section 524g trust for the resolution and payment of current and future yarway asbestos claims the agreement in principle which will be implemented through a chapter 11 plan for yarway will resolve the potential liability of the company protected parties for pending and future derivative personal injury claims related to exposure to asbestoscontaining products that were allegedly manufactured distributed andor sold by yarway “yarway asbestos claims” under the chapter 11 plan an asbestos settlement trust the “yarway trust” that conforms to the provisions of section 524g of the us bankruptcy code will be established and on the effective date of the chapter 11 plan the company and yarway will contribute to the yarway trust a total of 325 million in cash “settlement consideration” which includes approximately 100 million relating to the settlement of intercompany amounts allegedly due to yarway in exchange for the settlement consideration each of the company protected parties will receive the benefit of a release from yarway and an injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code permanently enjoining the assertion of yarway asbestos claims against those parties the agreement in principle is subject among other things to the negotiation and filing of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization for yarway incorporating the terms of such agreement the “plan” acceptance of the plan by at least 75 of yarway’s current asbestos claimants voting on such plan confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court and approval of the injunction in favor of the company protected parties by the united states district court for the district of delaware “district court” on the effective date of the plan which is anticipated to occur in the second half of fiscal 2015 the company and yarway will pay the settlement consideration and yarway asbestos claims against the company protected parties will be permanently enjoined yarway is anticipated to become a whollyowned subsidiary of the yarway trust and accordingly would no longer be owned by or be part of a consolidated group with the company unless extended by a further agreement the agreement in principle will expire if the order confirming the plan and implementing the injunction has not been entered or affirmed by the district court by april 30 2015 or if the effective date of the plan has not occurred by september 15 2016 as a result of the agreement in principle to settle the company has recorded a charge of 225 million in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014 

as a result of filing the voluntary bankruptcy petition during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the company recorded an expected loss upon deconsolidation of 10 million related to the yarway chapter 11 filing which continues to represent the company’s best estimate of its loss 

other claims 

the company continuously assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future asbestos claims and defense costs on a quarterly basis the company evaluates actual experience regarding asbestos claims filed settled and dismissed amounts paid in settlements and the recoverability of its insurance assets if and when data from actual experience demonstrate an unfavorable discernible trend the company performs a valuation of its asbestos related liabilities and corresponding insurance assets including a comprehensive review of the underlying assumptions in addition the company evaluates its ability to reasonably estimate claim activity beyond its current lookforward period in order to assess whether such period is appropriate in addition to claims and litigation experience the company considers additional qualitative and quantitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment the company’s strategy in managing claims and obtaining insurance including its defense strategy and health related trends in the overall population of individuals potentially exposed to asbestos the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance assets is warranted 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the company concluded that an unfavorable trend had developed in actual claim filing activity compared to projected claim filing activity established during the company’s most recent valuation accordingly the company with the assistance of independent actuarial service providers performed a revised valuation of its asbestosrelated liabilities and corresponding insurance assets as part of the revised valuation the company assessed whether a change in its lookforward period was appropriate taking into consideration its more extensive history and experience with asbestosrelated claims and litigation including its experience with yarway and determined that it was now possible to make a reasonable estimate of the actuarially determined ultimate risk of loss for pending and unasserted potential future asbestosrelated claims through 2056 in connection with the revised valuation the company considered a recent settlement with one of its insurers calling for the establishment of a qualified settlement fund and the results of a separate independent actuarial consulting firm report conducted in the fourth quarter to assist the company in obtaining insurance to fully fund all estimable asbestosrelated claims excluding yarway claims incurred through 2056 

the independent actuarial service firm calculated a total estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims of the company which reflects the company’s best estimate of its ultimate risk of loss to resolve all pending and future claims excluding yarway claims through 2056 which is the company’s reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestosrelated claims will be filed against company affiliates 

in conjunction with determining the total estimated liability the company retained an independent third party to assist it in valuing its insurance assets responsive to asbestosrelated claims excluding yarway claims these insurance assets represent amounts due to the company for previously settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its total liability for pending and unasserted potential future asbestos claims and defense costs in calculating this amount the company used the estimated asbestos liability for pending and projected future claims and defense costs described above and it also considered the amount of insurance available the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers resolution of insurance coverage issues gaps in coverage allocation methodologies and the terms of existing settlement agreements with insurance carriers 

as a result of the activity described above the company recorded a net charge in addition to the amounts described above for yarway of 240 million in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended september 26 2014 although the company’s methodology established a range of estimates of reasonably possible outcomes the company recorded its best estimate within such range based upon currently known information the companys estimated gross asbestos liability excluding yarway of 538 million was recorded within the companys consolidated balance sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of 245 million the aforementioned total estimated liability is on a pretax basis not discounted for the timevalue of money and includes defense costs which is consistent with the company’s historical accounting practices 

the effect of the change in our lookforward period reduced income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income by approximately 116 million and 71 million respectively in addition the effect of the change decreased the companys basic income from continuing operations and net income by 016 per share and decreased the companys diluted income from continuing operations and net income by 015 per share 

 the amounts recorded by the company for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets are based on the companys strategies for resolving its asbestos claims currently available information and a number of estimates and 

assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the identity of defendants the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the companys calculations vary significantly from actual results 

in connection with the foregoing during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 the company resolved disputes with certain of its historical insurers and agreed that certain insurance proceeds will be used to establish and fund a qualified settlement fund “qsf” within the meaning of the internal revenue code which will be used for the resolution of asbestos liabilities of the company other than yarway asbestos claims it is intended that the qsf will receive future insurance payments and proceeds from third party insurers and in addition will fund and manage liabilities for certain historical operations of the company in addition the company expects to make cash contributions to the qsf structure within the next 12 months of approximately 275 million to purchase insurance that will be dedicated to and is expected to fully fund these liabilities 

tax matters 

tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to years preceding the 2007 separation the issues and proposed adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the sharing provisions of a tax sharing agreement entered in 2007 with covidien and te connectivity the 2007 tax sharing agreement under which tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27  42  and 31  respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns the costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties tyco has previously disclosed that in connection with us federal tax audits the irs has raised a number of issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year although tyco has been able to resolve substantially all of the issues and adjustments proposed by the irs for tax years through 2007 it has not been able to resolve matters related to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions during the period as a result on june 20 2013 tyco received notices of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of tycos former us subsidiaries owe additional taxes of 8833 million  plus penalties of 154 million  based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time in addition tyco received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million  is expected to be asserted these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs position described below is ultimately proved correct 

the irs asserted in the notices of deficiency that substantially all of tycos intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and has disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on us income tax returns totaling approximately 29 billion  tyco strongly disagrees with the irs position and has filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments a trial date has been set for february 2016 tyco believes that it has meritorious defenses for its tax filings that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations and that the previously reported taxes for the years in question are appropriate 

no payments with respect to these matters would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on the experience of other companies could take several years tyco believes that its income tax reserves and the liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for the tax sharing agreements continue to be appropriate however the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on tycos financial condition results of operations and cash flows in particular if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion  which is expected to be disallowed by the irs

 dividend policy 

 the company makes dividend payments from its contributed surplus equity position these payments are made free of swiss withholding taxes and are effectively denominated in us dollars under swiss law the authority to declare dividends is vested in the companys general meeting of shareholders 

upon the closing of the merger transaction between tyco international ltd and its whollyowned subsidiary tyco ireland which is expected to occur in november 2014 our jurisdiction of incorporation will change from switzerland to ireland as a result the authority to declare and pay dividends will be vested in the board of directors the timing declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will be determined by our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition and results of operations the capital requirements of our businesses industry practice and any other relevant factors 

under irish law dividends may only be paid and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded out of “distributable reserves” which tyco ireland will not have immediately following the closing of the merger between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland the creation of distributable reserves of tyco ireland by way of a capital reduction of tyco ireland requires the approval of the irish high court and in connection with seeking such court approval we have obtained the approval of our shareholder to create distributable reserves for tyco ireland through the reduction of the share premium account of tyco ireland 

the approval of the irish high court is expected within approximately six to twelve weeks following the closing of the merger between tyco international ltd and tyco ireland we are not aware of any reason why the irish high court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves however the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the irish high court in the event that distributable reserves of tyco ireland are not created no distributions by way of dividends share repurchases or otherwise will be permitted under irish law with the exception of the dividend that is scheduled to be paid in february 2015 until such time as the group has created sufficient distributable reserves from its trading activities

operating income for the year ended september 27 2013   increased   131 million  or 227  to 709 million  as compared to operating income of 578 million  for the year ended september 28 2012  operating income for the year ended september 27 2013  was favorably impacted by our net revenue growth a smaller corporate footprint as a result of the 2012 separation as well as a higher mix of service revenue and operational improvements across all of our businesses operating income for the year ended september 27 2013  was also favorably impacted by a 99 million decline in net asbestos charges operating income for the year ended september 27 2013  was unfavorably impacted by an 83 million increase in environmental remediation charges as well as an increase in restructuring charges operating income for the year ended september 27 2013  was also unfavorably impacted by a charge of 27 million  resulting from the writeoff of an insurance receivable that had been established in respect of a legacy claim 

 items impacting operating income for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  are as follows

income loss from continuing operations attributable to tyco common shareholders 

interest income and expense 

interest income was 14 million  in 2014  as compared to 16 million  and 18 million  in 2013  and 2012  respectively interest income decreased in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to interest income received in fiscal 2013 related to a working capital adjustment related to the 2012 spinoff of tyco flow control 

interest expense was 97 million  in 2014  as compared to 100 million  and 209 million  in 2013  and 2012  respectively the weightedaverage interest rate on total debt outstanding was 65 for all three fiscal years the decrease in interest expense from 2012 to 2013 was primarily related to savings realized from the 26 billion debt redemptions in 2012 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net 

significant components of other income expense net for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  are as follows 



effective income tax rate 

our effective income tax rate was 39 during the year ended september 26 2014  our effective tax rate is affected by the mix of jurisdictions in which income is earned our effective tax rate for the year was favorably impacted by asbestos related charges that generated a tax benefit in a high tax jurisdiction partially offset by a reversal of a compensation reserve established in respect of legacy litigation with former management that generated tax expense in a high tax jurisdiction 

our effective income tax rate was 181 during the year ended september 27 2013  our effective tax rate for the year was favorably impacted by taxes on the environmental remediation charges incurred during the second quarter of 2013 partially offset by tax sharing agreement adjustments incurred throughout the year and enacted tax law changes in the fourth quarter of 2013 

 our effective income tax rate for the year ended september 28 2012  was not meaningful primarily as a result of separation related charges which were incurred for which no tax benefit was recognized as well as a valuation allowance of 235 million recorded due to net operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize in future periods additionally our effective income tax rate for the year ended september 28 2012  was impacted by enacted tax law changes favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions and a nonrecurring item generating a tax benefit 

the rate can vary from period to period due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 20 billion and 19 billion as of september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions specifically the valuation allowance as of september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  includes separation related charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt which further increased a net operating loss carryforward which the company does not expect to realize in future periods the valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when the company determined that it was morelikelythannot that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized the company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the companys consolidated balance sheets 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 

equity income loss in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 

equity income loss in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2014  2013  and 2012  reflects our share of atkore international group incs atkore net income or loss which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting equity income loss in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries during the years ended september 26 2014  september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  was a gain of 206 million and losses of 48 million and 26 million respectively      

on march 6 2014 we announced atkores intention to redeem all of our remaining common equity stake in atkore and on april 9 2014 the redemption was completed for aggregate cash proceeds of 250 million we recognized a net gain of 216 million related to this transaction which is comprised of a 227 million gain on the sale of the equity investment partially offset by an 11 million loss which is our share of loss on atkores debt extinguishment undertaken in connection with the redemption see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

key items impacting operating income for the years ended september 26 2014  september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  are as follows 

corporate and other 

corporate expense increased   301 million  or 944  to 620 million  for the year ended september 26 2014  as compared to 319 million  for the year ended september 27 2013  the increase in corporate expense for the year ended september 26 2014  was primarily due to asbestos related charges of 225 million relating to an agreement in principle reached with creditors of yarway an indirect subsidiary of the company and 240 million as a result of an updated valuation performed over the companys estimated liability for asbestos related claims excluding yarway claims the increase in expense was also due to higher restructuring repositioning and asset impairment charges partially offset by a 96 million reversal and recoveries from settlements with former management the increase in expense was also partially offset to a lesser extent by lower separation costs and a gain related to a legal settlement with cit see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our asbestos and legacy legal matters

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

depreciation and amortization methods for security monitoringrelated assets —tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories internally generated residential subscriber systems outside of north america internally generated commercial subscriber systems collectively referred to as subscriber system assets and customer accounts acquired through the adt dealer program primarily outside of north america referred to as dealer intangibles subscriber system assets include installed property plant and equipment for which tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber in certain geographical areas where the company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time the company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition the company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years the accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 140 to 360 for commercial subscriber pools and dealer intangibles and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method the company uses a straightline method with a 14year life for nonpooled subscriber system assets primarily in europe latin america and asia and related deferred revenue with remaining balances written off upon customer termination 

revenue recognition —contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems large security intruder systems and other constructionrelated projects are recorded primarily under the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion the risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in longterm contracts provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable 

sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements including equipment installation monitoring services and maintenance agreements we assess our revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting when ownership of the system is transferred to the customer each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery installation and customer acceptance is completed while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe or tpe is available revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the noncontingent upfront consideration received at the time of installation since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services 

product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct indirect and other market participants rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis 

loss contingencies —accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables —we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials we estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made in the future during a defined period of time the lookforward period on a quarterly basis the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on a quarterly basis the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters we record asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims in determining the amount of insurance recoverable we consider available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

insurable liabilities —the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a riskfree rate of return when the pattern and timing of the future obligation is reliably determinable the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes —in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is morelikelythannot the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairments —goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur in performing these assessments management relies on and considers a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable market transactions to the extent available other market data and the companys overall market capitalization we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

when testing for goodwill impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative fair value test is performed based upon our most recent annual impairment test completed as of june 30 2014 it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 

we recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows 

 while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values if our assumptions are not realized it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded however it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 

longlived assets —asset groups held and used by the company including property plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairments to longlived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets the calculation of the fair value of longlived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of longlived assets there is a risk that the carrying value of our longlived assets may be overstated or understated 

pension and postretirement benefits —our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses for active plans such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our 

pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately 87 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately 2 million we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class historical performance of asset classes over longterm periods asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected longterm return on plan assets a 25 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately 5 million

contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable operating leases and purchase obligations as of september 26 2014  are as follows  in millions 

 

 as of september 26 2014  we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of 267 million and gross interest and penalties of 36 million we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the remaining payments in future years therefore such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table however based on the current status of our income tax audits we believe that it is reasonably possible that between nil and 20 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months although the company had unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate the company had net operating loss carryforwards which would offset the cash impact of any such recognition of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the current year 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in connection with the 2012 separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against tyco prior to the 2012 separation under the 2012 tax sharing agreement pentair tyco and adt share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tyco flow controls tycos and adts us income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement excluding approximately 175 million of pre2012 separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 separation collectively shared tax liabilities the company will be responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities pentair and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities pentair adt and tyco will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million the company expects to pay 21 million to settle certain pre2012 separation related tax liabilities the timing and amounts of these payments are subject to a number of uncertainties and could change see notes 13 and 6 respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the 2007 separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against tyco prior to the 2007 separation under the 2007 separation and distribution agreement and 2007 tax sharing agreement we have assumed 27 covidien has assumed 42 and te connectivity has assumed 31 of certain tyco preseparation contingent and other corporate liabilities which as of september 26 2014  primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spinoffs or the distributions made or brought by any third party 

backlog 

we had a backlog of unfilled orders of 4862 million and 4812 million as of september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  respectively 

the companys backlog includes recurring revenueinforce and longterm deferred revenue for upfront fees from its na and row installation  services segments revenueinforce represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security and fire business backlog by segment was as follows  in millions 



backlog increased 50 million or 10 to 4862 million as of september 26 2014  as compared to 4812 million in the prior year the net increase in backlog as of september 26 2014  was primarily due to a 58 million increase in total backlog in our na installation  services segment relating to our fire business this increase was partially offset by a decline in recurring revenue in force and deferred revenue in our security business the 7 million increase in our row installation  services segment total backlog was driven by an increase in growth markets and asia which was further improved by the westfire and other acquisitions total backlog for our global products segment declined by 15 million due to our fire products and life safety businesses which was partially offset by growth in our security business changes in foreign currency had an unfavorable impact on backlog of 128 million or 27 and primarily related to the row installation  services segment 

guarantees 

certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of thirdparties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal year 2015 through the completion of such transactions and would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance the companys performance under the guarantees if required would not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

there are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among tyco covidien te connectivity adt and pentair in accordance with the terms of the 2007 and 2012 separation and distribution agreements and the tax sharing agreements the guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the tax sharing agreements at the time of the 2007 and 2012 separations we recorded liabilities necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax sharing agreements in addition prior to the 2007 and 2012 separations we provided support in the form of financial andor performance guarantees to various covidien te connectivity adt and tyco flow control operating entities to the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the 2007 and 2012 separations we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including for example unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance we record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

during the year ended september 26 2014  tyco replaced available for sale investments held as collateral for the companys insurable liabilities with letters of credit of approximately 137 million as of september 26 2014  and september 27 2013 we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately 662 million and 424 million respectively

nonus gaap measure 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by us gaap we also disclose the nonus gaap measure of organic revenue growth decline we believe that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented when read in conjunction with our us gaap revenue it enables investors to better evaluate our operations without giving effect to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and acquisition and divestiture activity either of which may be significant from period to period in addition organic revenue growth decline is a factor we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business this measure is not a financial measure under us gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue as determined in accordance with us gaap and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies organic revenue growth decline presented herein is defined as revenue growth decline excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations acquisitions and divestitures and other changes that may not reflect underlying results and trends our organic growth decline calculations incorporate an estimate of prior year reported net revenue associated with acquired entities that have been fully integrated within the first year and exclude prior year net revenue associated with entities that do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations which have been divested within the past year adjusted number we calculate the rate of organic growth decline based on the adjusted number to better reflect the rate of growth decline of the combined business in the case of acquisitions or the remaining business in the case of dispositions we base the rate of organic growth decline for acquired businesses that are not fully integrated within the first year upon unadjusted historical net revenue foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by subtracting i the us dollar equivalent of local currencies for the current period using monthly weighted average exchange rates for the prior period from ii the us dollar equivalent of local currencies for the current period using monthly weighted average exchange rates for the current period we may use organic revenue growth decline as a component of our compensation programs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of conducting business we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices accordingly we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject we seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may from time to time include forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency options interest rate swaps commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated nonfunctional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so 

we do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us we only enter into contracts with counterparties having strong investment grade longterm credit ratings from standard  poors and moodys these counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party 

foreign currency exposures 

we hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to operating entities through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts additionally for our corporate financing entities we manage the foreign currency exposure through a combination of multicurrency notional pool and forward contracts our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar the market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contract is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on september 26 2014  a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 3 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 3 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 

as of september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  respectively 15 billion and 14 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature for the fiscal years ended september 26 2014  september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  we recorded a cumulative translation loss of 28 million a gain of 3 million and a gain of 48 million respectively through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans 

interest rate exposures 

we manage interest rate risk typically by using from time to time interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes these swap transactions typically convert interest rates of fixedrate debt to variable rates since september 28 2012 tifsa has had no outstanding interest rate swaps accordingly as of september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  the total gross notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts was nil for both periods

segments 

each of our three segments serves a highly diverse customer base and none is dependent upon a single customer or group of customers for fiscal year 2013  no customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenues and approximately 50 of our revenues were derived from customers outside of north america 

our enduse customers to whom we may sell directly or through wholesalers distributors commercial builders or contractors can generally be grouped in the following categories 

 as discussed under competition below the markets in which we compete are generally highly fragmented we therefore compete with many other businesses in markets throughout the world including other large global businesses significant regional businesses and many smaller local businesses 

installation  services 

na installation  services and row installation  services collectively installation  services designs sells installs services and monitors electronic security and fire detection and suppression systems for retail commercial industrial governmental and institutional customers around the world additionally row installation  services designs sells installs services and monitors security systems for residential and small business customers under the adt brand name outside of north america 

security services 

our installation  services segments design sell install and service security systems to detect intrusion control access and react to movement fire smoke flooding environmental conditions industrial processes and other hazards these electronic security systems include detection devices that are usually connected to a monitoring center that receives and records alarm signals where security monitoring specialists verify alarm conditions and initiate a range of response scenarios for most systems control panels identify the nature of the alarm and the areas where a sensor was triggered our other security solutions include access control systems for sensitive areas such as government facilities and banks video surveillance systems designed to deter theft and fraud and help protect employees and customers and asset protection and security management systems designed to monitor and protect physical assets as well as proprietary electronic data our offerings also include antitheft systems utilizing acoustomagnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry as well as store performance solutions to enhance retailer performance many of the worlds leading retailers use our sensormatic  antitheft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft many of the products that we install for our installation  

services security customers are designed and manufactured by our global products segment additionally our deep experience in designing integrating deploying and maintaining largescale security systems—including for example centrally managed security systems that span large commercial and institutional campuses—allows us to install andor service products manufactured by third parties 

purchasers of our intrusion systems typically contract for ongoing security system monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation these contracts are generally for a term of one to three years systems installed at customers premises may be owned by us or by our customers monitoring center personnel may respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to local fire or police departments notifying the customer or taking other appropriate action in certain markets we directly provide the alarm response services with highly trained and professionally equipped employees in some instances alarm systems are connected directly to local fire or police departments 

in addition our row installation  services segment is a leading provider of monitored residential and small business security systems in addition to traditional burglar alarm and fire detection systems installation and monitoring services row installation  services provides patrol and response services in select geographies including south africa and south korea our row installation  services segment continues to expand its offering of valueadded residential services worldwide such as an interactive services platform the interactive services platform allows for remote management of the home security system as well as lifestyle applications which currently include remote video lighting control and energy management 

our customers are often prompted to purchase security systems by their insurance carriers which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that a system be installed as a condition of coverage 

fire protection services 

our installation  services segments design sell install and service fire detection and fire suppression systems in both new and existing facilities commercial construction as well as legislation mandating the installation and service of fire detection and suppression systems are significant drivers of demand for our products our installation  services segments offer a wide range of fire detection and suppression systems including those designed and manufactured by our global products segment and those designed by third parties these detection systems include fire alarm control panels advanced fire alarm monitoring systems smoke and flame detection systems heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems our installation  services segments also offer a wide range of standard waterbased sprinkler and chemical suppression systems and custom designed special hazard suppression systems which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams dry chemicals and gases in addition to spill control products designed to absorb neutralize and solidify spills of hazardous materials these systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications including oil and gas power generation mining petrochemical manufacturing transportation data processing telecommunications commercial food preparation and marine applications our installation  services segments continue to focus on system maintenance and inspection which have become increasingly important parts of our business 

customers 

our installation  services customers range from fortune 500 companies with diverse worldwide operations who look to us to provide integrated global solutions for their fire and security needs to single location commercial customers and individual homeowners our installation  services customer relationships generally are in the market for new construction or retrofit projects which represented 44 of installation  services fiscal 2013  net revenue and the market for aftermarket products and services which accounted for the remaining 56 of installation  services fiscal 2013  net revenue new construction projects are inherently longlead in nature and we strive to become involved in the planning process for these projects as early as possible we believe that by actively participating in the preliminary design stages of a new construction project and by offering our design services that combine our global expertise and knowledge of local codes and standards we can increase our value to customers relative to many smaller local and regional competitors with respect to fire detection and suppression installations we prefer to become involved at the time an architectural or engineering design firm is selected with respect to security system design and installation we generally become involved in the later stages of a construction project or as tenants take occupancy 

our relationships with customers in the aftermarket may include any combination of alarm monitoring fire and security maintenance and or testing and inspection services we also provide aftermarket services to many customers whose fire and security systems were manufactured or installed by third parties 

global products 

our global products segment designs manufactures and sells fire protection security and life safety products including intrusion security antitheft devices breathing apparatus and access control and video management systems 

fire protection products 

fire protection products designs manufactures distributes and sells fire alarm and fire detection systems automatic fire sprinkler systems and special hazard suppression systems including many of the fire protection products that our installation  services segments install and service fire protection products also manufactures and sells grooved products for the rapid joining of piping in both the fire and nonfire markets fire protection products are marketed under various leading trade names including simplex wormald ansul grinnell and tyco  and include fire alarm control panels advanced fire alarm monitoring systems smoke heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems fire protection products also offers a wide range of waterbased sprinkler systems and custom designed special hazard suppression systems which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams dry chemicals and gases these systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications including oil and gas power generation mining petrochemical manufacturing transportation data processing telecommunications commercial food preparation and marine applications 

fire protection products systems often are purchased by facility owners through construction engineers and electrical contractors as well as mechanical or general contractors in recent years retrofitting of existing buildings has increased as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems especially in hotels restaurants healthcare facilities and educational establishments the 2009 edition of the international residential code developed by the international code council a nonprofit association that develops model codes that are the predominant building and fire safety regulations followed by state and local jurisdictions in the united states adopted a proposal advanced by firefighters and other lifesafety advocates that requires sprinkler systems in new one and twofamily homes and townhouses as of january 2011 this national code is not binding on state and local jurisdictions and must be adopted locally before it becomes mandatory for new homes being built in these areas the timing and extent of adoption if at all will vary by jurisdiction however we believe that this development may offer opportunities to expand our residential fire suppression business in the united states 

security products 

security products designs and manufactures a wide array of electronic security products including integrated video surveillance and access control systems to enable businesses to manage their security and enhance business performance our global access control solutions include integrated security management systems for enterprise applications access control solutions applications alarm management panels door controllers readers keypads and cards our global video system solutions include digital video management systems matrix switchers and controllers digital multiplexers programmable cameras monitors and liquid crystal interactive displays our security products for homes and businesses range from basic burglar alarms to comprehensive interactive security systems including alarm control panels keypads sensors and central station receiving equipment used in security monitoring centers our offerings also include antitheft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry our security products are marketed under various leading trade names including software house dsc american dynamics sensormatic visonic and exacq  many of the worlds leading retailers use our sensormatic  antitheft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft security products manufactures many of the security products that our installation  services business installs and services

customers 

global products sells products through our installation  service segments and indirect distribution channels around the world some of global products channel business partners act as dealers selling to smaller fire and security contractors that install fire detection and suppression security and theft protection systems whereas others act as integrators that install the products themselves builders contractors and developers are customers for our sprinkler products end customers for our breathing apparatus and related products include fire departments municipal and state governments and military forces as well as major companies in the industrial sector 

competition 

the markets that we serve are generally highly competitive and fragmented with a small number of large global firms and thousands of smaller regional and local companies competition is based on price specialized product capacity breadth of product line training support and delivery with the relative importance of these factors varying depending on the project 

complexity product line the local market and other factors rather than compete primarily on price we emphasize the quality of our products and services the reputation of our brands and our knowledge of customers fire and security needs among large industrial commercial governmental and institutional customers we believe that our comprehensive global coverage and product and service offerings provide a competitive advantage we also believe that our systems integration capabilities which allow us to offer global solutions to customers that fully integrate our security andor fire offerings into existing information technology networks business operations and management tools and process automation and control systems set us apart from all but a small number of other large global competitors 

competitive dynamics in the fire and security industry generally result in more direct competition and lower margins for installation projects compared to aftermarket products and services we generally face the greatest competitive pricing pressure for the installation of products that have become more commoditized over time including standard commercial sprinkler systems and closedcircuit television systems

patents trademarks copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including trademarks patents and patent applications in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and misappropriation of our proprietary rights and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to electronic security products and systems for intrusion detection access control electronic identification tags  video surveillance fire protection products and systems including fire detection and fire suppression with chemical gas foam and water agents personal protective products and systems for fire and other hazards we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks 

while we consider our patents to be valuable assets that help prevent or delay the commoditization of our products and thus extend their life cycles we do not believe that our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents we share the adt® trademark with adt and operate under a brand governance agreement between the two companies 

research and development 

we are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate for example in order to position ourselves to participate in and lead the development of residential interactive platforms enterprisewide integrated access control platforms and transition ip video platforms we have made significant investments in our security products portfolio in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment our research and development expense was  174  million in 2013  145 million in 2012  and 129 million in 2011  related to new product development 

raw and other purchased materials 

we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including fuel for our vehicle fleet we purchase materials from a large number of independent sources around the world and have experienced no shortages that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses we enter into longterm supply contracts using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions significant changes in certain raw material including steel brass and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression agents may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the united states in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states and nonus jurisdictions in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries our security businesses currently rely 

extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals wireline and wireless telephone companies in the united states are regulated by the federal and state governments in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our fire businesses these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations both favorably and unfavorably for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors—risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters and item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and the health and safety of our employees 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties 

given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 74 million  to 162 million  as of september 27 2013  as of september 27 2013  we concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 105 million  of which 82 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and accounts payable and 23 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet the majority of these liabilities relate to the ongoing remediation efforts at a facility in our global products segment located in marinette wisconsin in view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows for a more detailed description of these liabilities see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of september 27 2013  we employed approximately 70000  people worldwide of which approximately 20000  were employed in the united states and approximately 50000  were outside the united states approximately 7000  employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as technological obsolescence labor relations geopolitical events climate change and international operations 

risks relating to our businesses 

 general economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of certain markets that we serve for example demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial and residential construction industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance and the amount of discretionary business and consumer spending each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality even if demand for our products is not negatively affected the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full andor on a timely basis 

much of the demand for installation of security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit in recent years many commercial and residential real estate markets have experienced significant fluctuations in supply and demand and this volatility may continue indefinitely in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing from banks and other institutional lenders in order to initiate and complete projects declines in real estate values in many parts of the world have led to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors have in turn hampered demand for new fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction expensive maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could raise the cost of new debt for our customers to prohibitive levels any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue including tax receipts general obligation and construction bonds endowments and donations have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products and services among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we face competition in each of our businesses which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products and services if we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

we operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service providers both domestically and on a global basis our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from alternative service providers around the world currently key components of our competitive position are our ability to bring to market industryleading products and services to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully these factors require continuous management focus on maintaining our competitive position through technological innovation cost reduction productivity improvement and a regular appraisal of our asset portfolio if we are unable to maintain our position as a market leader or to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or costeffectiveness or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

 our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by evolving industry standards although many of our largest competitors are also global industrial companies we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products and services at lower cost than ours particularly in emerging markets or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate we have found that in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses 

accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive products and services to market quickly and costeffectively adapting our businesses to serve more local markets will require us to invest considerable resources in building our distribution channels and engineering and manufacturing capabilities in those markets to ensure that we can address customer demand even when we invest in growing our business in local markets we may not be successful for any number of reasons including competitive pressure from regional and local businesses that may have superior local capabilities or products that are produced more locally at lower cost our ability to develop or acquire new products and services can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand images could suffer in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure to effectively adapt our products and services to the needs of local markets the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance the potential for product defects or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our installation service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances and we typically maintain product liability insurance to mitigate the risk that our products and services fail to operate as expected however in the event of litigation with respect to such matters it is possible that contract limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable that our insurance coverage is not adequate or that insurance carriers deny coverage of our claims as a result 

such employee acts or omissions or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business 

our business operates and serves consumers worldwide there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in order to manage our daytoday operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures any of which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue and certain of our costs assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure have undergone significant devaluation in the past which can reduce the value of our local monetary assets reduce the us dollar value of our local cash flow and potentially reduce the us dollar value of future local net income although we intend to enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of our risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are a large buyer of metals and other nonmetal commodities including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method 

we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we may enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations these hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform as a result changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings these acquisitions are likely to include businesses in emerging markets which are often riskier than acquisitions in developed markets we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations moreover we may be unable to obtain strategic or operational benefits that are expected from our acquisitions any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

 a significant percentage of our future growth is anticipated to come from emerging markets and if we are unable to expand our operations in emerging markets our growth rate could be negatively affected 

one aspect of our growth strategy is to seek significant growth in emerging markets including china india latin america and the middle east through both organic investments and through acquisitions emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks than more mature markets where legal systems are more developed and familiar to us in some cases emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions are more susceptible to corruption and are locations where it may be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures negative or uncertain political climates in developing and emerging markets could also adversely affect us 

we cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful if we are unable to manage the risks inherent in our growth strategy in emerging markets including civil unrest international hostilities natural disasters security breaches and failure to maintain compliance with multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

 failure to maintain and upgrade the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and other information noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information or a violation of the companys privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and in the normal course of our business we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers stockholders and employees the legal regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cybercriminals around the world a significant actual or potential theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of customer stockholder employee or our data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines litigation or regulatory action against us in addition we depend on our information technology infrastructure for businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations increasingly our security products and services are accessed through the internet and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services via the internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services 

failure to maintain upgrade and consolidate our information and technology networks could adversely affect us 

we are continuously upgrading and consolidating our systems including making changes to legacy systems replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders potential disruption of our internal control structure substantial capital expenditures additional administration and operating expenses retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition the implementation of new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated 

 if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 failure to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 

our culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training motivating and developing employees and in particular we strive to attract motivate train and retain qualified engineers and managers to handle the daytoday operations of a highly diversified organization many of our manufacturing processes and many of the integrated solutions we offer are highly technical in nature our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire train and retain engineers and other technical professionals with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for resources is intense our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract retain and integrate qualified managers and engineers if we fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

 we may be required to recognize substantial impairment charges in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to assess our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets periodically to determine whether they are impaired disruptions to our business unfavorable endmarket conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in material charges for goodwill and other asset impairments we maintain significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet and we believe these balances are recoverable however fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected with the annual impairment analysis future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 our residential and commercial security businesses may experience higher rates of customer attrition which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers increasing our depreciation and amortization expense 

if our residential security customers located outside of north america or our commercial security customers are dissatisfied with our products or services and switch to competitive products or services or disconnect for other reasons our recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide we amortize the costs of acquired monitoring contracts and related customer relationships based on the estimated life of the customer relationships internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated if customer disconnect rates were to rise 

significantly we may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

 divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ approximately 70000  people worldwide approximately 10  of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works council other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

 a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we may be unable to execute our strategies following the spinoffs of adt and tyco flow control 

in connection with the spinoffs of our former north american residential and small business security business and flow control businesses in september 2012 we anticipated certain financial operational managerial and other benefits to tyco and in particular we commenced certain productivity and other strategic initiatives following the spinoffs intended to reduce complexity restructure operations and leverage tyco’s scale in certain areas such as sourcing we may not be able to achieve the anticipated results of these actions on the scale that we expected and the anticipated benefits of the spinoffs and the productivity and other strategic initiatives may not be fully realized 

 we and adt have entered into noncompete and nonsolicit restrictions that prohibit us from competing with adt in the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada and prohibit adt from competing with us in the commercial fire and security businesses in each case until september 29 2014 

the adt separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs includes noncompete provisions pursuant to which i we are prohibited from competing with adt in the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada and ii adt is prohibited from competing with tyco in the commercial fire and security businesses subject to certain small business related exceptions in each case until september 29 2014 in addition the 

adt separation and distribution agreement contains nonsolicitation provisions preventing i us from soliciting adt’s residential small business customers in the united states and canada and ii adt from soliciting our security customers in each case until september 29 2014 this effectively prevents us from expanding into adt’s business and adt from expanding into our business in these jurisdictions until september 29 2014 when these restrictions expire adt could seek to compete with us for commercial security customers especially smaller businesses if adt were successful in this regard it could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results and operations and cash flows 

 in connection with the 2012 separation we rebranded our north american commercial security business to tyco integrated security and we no longer own the right to use the adt ®  brand name in the united states and canada 

prior to the spinoff of adt in september 2012 we rebranded our north american commercial security business to tyco integrated security there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve name recognition or status under our new brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed the failure of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers resulting in reduced revenues in addition as a result of the spinoffs we own the adt ®  brand name in jurisdictions outside of the united states and canada and adt owns the brand name in the united states and canada although we have entered agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt ®  brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the united states and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt ®  brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the united states and canada any of these factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

 we are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to claims and lawsuits including from time to time claims for damages related to product liability and warranties litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights litigation alleging anticompetitive behavior and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages furthermore we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage the defense of these lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of our managements attention in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies or suffer from adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install these claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability 

we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in addition if any of our products prove to be defective we may be required to recall or redesign such products which could result in significant unexpected costs any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred and our insurance carriers may deny coverage for claims made by us any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances we cannot provide assurance however that these limitations will be enforced losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 our businesses operate in a regulated industry 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws fire and security codes and standards and other laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business the loss of such licenses or the imposition of conditions to the granting or retention of such licenses could have a material adverse effect on us furthermore our systems generally must meet fire and building codes in order to be installed and it is possible that our current or future products will fail to meet such codes which could require us to make costly modifications to our products or to forgo marketing in certain jurisdictions 

changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 our international operations are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations as applicable no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

 we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws outside the united states 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the us securities and exchange commission sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition 

furthermore in september 2012 we agreed to the settlement of charges related to alleged fcpa violations with the doj and sec in connection with the settlement we entered into a consent agreement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj and a subsidiary of ours which is no longer part of tyco as a result of the 2012 separation pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the fcpa pursuant to the nonprosecution agreement we have acknowledged that a number of our subsidiaries made payments both directly and indirectly to government officials in order to obtain and retain business with private and stateowned entities and falsely described the payments in the subsidiaries books records and accounts the nonprosecution agreement also acknowledges tycos timely voluntary and complete disclosure to the doj and our cooperation with the dojs investigationincluding a global internal investigation concerning bribery and related misconductand extensive remediation under the nonprosecution and other agreements we have agreed to cooperate with and report periodically to the doj and other governmental authorities concerning our compliance efforts and related matters and to continue to implement an enhanced compliance program and internal controls designed to prevent and detect fcpa violations notwithstanding our settlement of the doj and sec investigations we may be subject to allegations of fcpa violations in the future and we may be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of these compliance matters if so or if we are unable to comply with the provisions of the nonprosecution and other agreements we may be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the doj or sec in such a case we could be subject to material fines injunctions on future conduct the imposition of a compliance monitor or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and international trade laws when we receive information alleging improper 

activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor foreign laws such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and our business prospects 

  we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts the companys historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future and we continually assess our strategy for resolving asbestos claims unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

due to the number of claims and limited amount of assets at yarway corporation “yarway” one of the companys indirect subsidiaries yarway filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware as a result of this filing all asbestos claims against yarway have been stayed pending confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court yarway’s goal is to negotiate obtain approval of and consummate a plan of reorganization that establishes an appropriately funded trust to provide for the fair and equitable payment of legitimate current and future yarway asbestos claims accompanied by appropriate injunctive relief permanently protecting yarway and certain other protected parties from any further asbestos claims arising from products manufactured sold andor distributed by yarway however we cannot assure you that the relief granted by the bankruptcy court will be satisfactory to yarway or its nondebtor affiliates and a failure to obtain satisfactory relief could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we currently record an estimated liability related to pending claims and claims estimated to be received over the next fifteen years including related defense costs based on a number of key assumptions and estimation methodologies these assumptions are derived from claims experience over the past three years and reflect our expectations about future claim activities over the next fifteen years these assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate and accordingly we may incur additional liabilities in the future a change in one or more of the inputs or the methodology that we use to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims although it is possible that the company will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond the next fifteen years we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time on a quarterly and annual basis we perform analyses to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions 

we also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities there are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestosrelated recoveries such as policy triggers policy or contract interpretation success in litigation in certain cases the methodology for allocating claims to policies and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties the assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate and as a result actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables and cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs due to these uncertainties as well as our inability to reasonably estimate any additional asbestos liability for claims that may be filed beyond the next fifteen years it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the cost nor potential recoveries of resolving the pending and all unasserted asbestos claims additionally we believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond the next fifteen years net of expected recoveries could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we have received notification from the united states environmental protection agency and from other environmental agencies that conditions at several sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to 

investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties these projects relate to a variety of activities including 

 these projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware 

 we depend on thirdparty licenses for our products and services 

we rely on certain software technology that we license from third parties and use in our products and services to perform key functions and provide critical functionality particularly in our commercial security business because our products and services incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties we are to a certain extent dependent upon such third parties ability to maintain or enhance their current products and services to ensure that their products are free of defects or security vulnerabilities to develop new products and services on a timely and costeffective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes further these thirdparty technology licenses may not always be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all if our agreements with thirdparty vendors are not renewed or the thirdparty software fails to address the needs of our software products and services we would be required to find alternative software products and services or technologies of equal performance or functionality we cannot assure that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by thirdparty software if we lose the license to this software it becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products and services or is otherwise not adequately maintained or updated furthermore even if we obtain licenses to alternative software products or services that provide the functionality we need we may be required to replace hardware installed at our monitoring centers and at our customers sites including security system control panels and peripherals in order to effect our integration of or migration to alternative software products any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are from time to time subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties including practicing entities and nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can 

be expensive and timeconsuming and the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 legislative action by the us congress could adversely affect us 

legislative action could be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties or modify statutes or regulations upon which we rely which could materially and adversely affect our effective corporate tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in switzerland or limiting our ability as a swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between switzerland and the united states we could be subject to increased taxation 

 police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies 

police departments in a limited number of us cities do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance we have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies in most cases through contracts with us which increases the overall cost to customers if more police departments whether inside or outside the us were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 

risks related to our liquidity and financial markets 

 disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us our customers and our suppliers by increasing our funding costs or reducing the availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of common shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets in 2009 and 2010 credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects based on these conditions our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected 

 covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit agreements contain customary financial covenants including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt in addition the indentures governing our bonds contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions 

although we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 

 material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

we estimate that our available cash our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future however material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar contingencies could require additional funding if 

such developments require us to obtain additional funding we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

such an outcome could have important consequences to you for example it could 

  we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial health and may decrease our profitability 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or if our cash requirements are more than we expect we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital stock the terms of the debt or capital stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity your percentage ownership in us would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed it could affect our financial health which could negatively affect your investment in us 

risks relating to tax matters 

 examinations and audits by tax authorities including the irs could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

tyco’s and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 separation we previously disclosed that in connection with us federal tax audits the irs has raised a number of issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year in particular we have been unable to resolve with the irs matters related to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions in existence prior to the 2007 separation as a result on june 20 2013 we received notices of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of our former us subsidiaries owe additional taxes of 8833 million plus penalties of 154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time in addition we received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million is expected to be asserted these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs position described below is ultimately proved correct in addition the adjustments proposed by the irs are subject to the sharing provisions of a tax sharing agreement entered in 2007 with covidien and te connectivity under which tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns 

the irs asserted in the notices of deficiency that substantially all of tyco’s intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on us income tax returns totaling approximately 29 billion we strongly disagree with the irs position and have filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments we believe that we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings that the irs positions with regard to these matters is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations and that the previously reported taxes for the years in question are appropriate furthermore we believe that tyco’s income tax reserves and the liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for the tax sharing arrangements are appropriate however the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in particular if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion which is expected to be disallowed by the irs 

 we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and te connectivitys income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including june 29 2007 

in connection with the 2007 separation tyco entered into a tax sharing agreement the 2007 tax sharing agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre2007 separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 separation as noted above tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 separation in the event the 2007 separation or certain related transactions is determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 separation by tyco covidien or te connectivity the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on tyco covidien or te connectivity as a result thereof if none of the companies is responsible for such failure then tyco covidien and te connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 tax sharing agreement costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties 

if any party to the 2007 tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the 2007 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our covidiens and te connectivitys tax liabilities 

as noted above with respect to years prior to and including the 2007 separation we are litigating certain issues and proposed tax adjustments that the irs has raised that are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which may require tyco to make a payment to a taxing authority covidien or te connectivity tyco has recorded a liability as of september 27 2013 which it has assessed and believes is adequate to cover the payments that tyco may be required to make under the 2007 tax sharing agreement however the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in tyco being responsible for a greater amount than it expects under the 2007 tax sharing agreement 

 we share responsibility for certain of our pentairs and adts income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with the distributions we entered into the 2012 tax sharing agreement with pentair and adt that is separate from the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which governs the rights and obligations of tyco adt and pentair for certain tax liabilities before the distributions including tycos obligations under the 2007 tax sharing agreement under the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco pentair and adt share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to adts us tyco flow controls and tycos income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement excluding approximately 175 million of pre2012 separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 separation collectively shared tax liabilities tyco will be responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities pentair and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities tyco pentair and adt will share 525 20 and 275 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 275 and 525 by pentair adt and tyco respectively as of september 28 2012 tyco established liabilities representing the fair market value of its obligations under the 2012 tax sharing arrangement which is recorded in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet with an offset to tyco shareholders equity in addition we entered into a nonincome tax sharing agreement with adt in connection with the adt distribution to the extent we are responsible for any liability under these agreements there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that if any party were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of certain taxes that may arise as a result of the failure of the distributions to be tax free such taxes as defined in the 2012 tax sharing agreement distribution taxes each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our pentairs and adts tax liabilities 

 if the distributions or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor both adt and pentair could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco has received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distributions to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distributions will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 andor 361 of the code except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of adt common stock or of pentair common shares the private letter ruling also provides that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter ruling tyco has received an opinion from the law firm of mcdermott will  emery llp confirming the taxfree status of the distributions for us federal income tax purposes the private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us pentair and adt regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distributions or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distributions or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership which might take into account changes in pentair stock ownership resulting from the merger or asset ownership after the distributions an opinion of counsel represents counsels best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinions will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distributions ultimately are determined to be taxable the distributions could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to you for us federal income tax purposes and you could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the pentair common shares and the shares of adt common stock distributed to our shareholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we pentair or adt could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distributions or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distributions by us pentair or adt the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us pentair or adt as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distributions by us pentair or adt then we pentair and adt will share the liability in the manner and according to the sharing percentages set forth in the 2012 tax sharing agreement such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

 if the distributions or the merger are determined to be taxable for swiss withholding tax purposes we adt and pentair could incur significant swiss withholding tax liabilities 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to tycos shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder as of january 1 2011 distributions to shareholders out of qualifying contributed surplus accumulated on or after january 1 1997 are exempt from swiss withholding tax if certain conditions are met  kapitaleinlageprinzip  tyco has obtained a ruling from the swiss federal tax administration confirming that the distributions qualify as payment out of such qualifying contributed surplus and no amount was withheld by tyco when making the distributions 

we have obtained tax rulings from the swiss tax administrations confirming that the merger is a transaction that is generally taxfree for swiss federal cantonal and communal tax purposes including with respect to swiss stamp tax and swiss withholding tax however these tax rulings rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco notwithstanding these tax rulings the swiss federal tax administration could determine on audit that the distributions or the merger should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax or other tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated if the distributions or the merger ultimately are determined to be taxable for withholding tax or other tax purposes tyco and tyco shareholders could incur material swiss withholding tax liabilities that could significantly detract from or eliminate the benefits of the distributions and the merger in addition tyco could become liable to indemnify pentair for part of any swiss withholding tax liabilities to the extent provided under the 2012 tax sharing agreement 

 we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances as a result of the distributions because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted as a result of the distributions in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distributions even if the distributions otherwise qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporatelevel gain to tyco and certain of its affiliates under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares pentairs shares or adts shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distributions any acquisitions or issuances of our shares pentairs shares or adts shares within two years after the distributions generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan although we pentair or adt may be able to rebut that presumption 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to us of the distributions under the 2012 tax sharing agreement that we entered with pentair and adt we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distributions and related transactions from being taxfree further for the twoyear period following the distributions without obtaining the consent of pentair and adt a private letter ruling from the irs or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm we may be prohibited from 

 

these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business moreover the 2012 tax sharing agreement also provides that we will be responsible for any taxes imposed on pentair or any of its affiliates or on adt or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distributions or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distributions by or in respect of us any of our affiliates or our shareholders 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in switzerland 

 changes to swiss law in particular significantly heightened risk of criminal penalties for executives and directors could make it difficult for us to recruit and retain executives and directors 

in march 2013 swiss voters passed a ballot initiative as a result of which switzerland’s federal constitution was amended among other things this constitutional amendment requires the adoption of legislation that prohibits certain compensation practices in relation to a company’s directors and members of executive management such as severance compensation advance compensation and incentive commissions in connection with the sale and purchase of businesses the constitutional amendment further requires a public company’s board of directors to submit the proposed compensation for directors and members of executive management to a binding shareholder vote the initial ordinance implementing these requirements is expected to become effective on january 1 2014 based on the preliminary draft ordinance made public in june 2013 we expect among other things the ordinance to provide for the imprisonment of directors and members of executive management for up to three years if such individuals violate certain provisions of the ordinance we further believe that certain ordinary course compensation practices and other activities that we view as widely accepted among our peers may no longer be permissible under swiss law the draft ordinance further leaves considerable uncertainty as to the legality of certain compensation arrangements for our directors and executives under swiss law as a result our ability to compete for talent with our peer companies and our board’s ability to fulfill its compensation oversight and executive succession planning duties may be materially adversely affected 

additionally swiss voters are currently expected to vote on a number of ballot initiatives that may adversely affect the general business climate in switzerland among other things a ballot initiative on which swiss voters are expected to vote in november 2013 generally referred to as the “112 initiative” would require if approved that the highest salary paid by a company to an employee to not be greater than twelve times the lowest salary paid by the same company if the 112 initiative is approved and implemented by legislation we believe that the ensuing limitations would materially adversely affect our ability to compete with our peer companies incorporated outside switzerland 

swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of tycos securities 

because of differences between swiss law and us state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of swiss companies and those incorporated in the us it may not be possible to enforce in switzerland court judgments obtained in the united states against tyco based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws 

of the united states as a result in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws us investors may find it difficult to 

 original actions against persons in switzerland based solely upon the us federal or state securities laws are governed among other things by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on international private law this statute provides that the application of provisions of nonswiss law by the courts in switzerland shall be precluded if the result was incompatible with swiss public policy also mandatory provisions of swiss law may be applicable regardless of any other law that would otherwise apply 

switzerland and the united states do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the united states in switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a nonswiss court may be enforced in switzerland only if 

  our status as a swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax or at all 

swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years our current authorized share capital will expire on march 6 2015 additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example dividends must be approved by shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

under swiss law a swiss corporation may pay dividends only if the corporation has sufficient distributable profits from previous fiscal years or if the corporation has distributable reserves each as evidenced by its audited statutory balance sheet distributable reserves are generally booked either as free reserves or as contributed surplus contributions received from shareholders in the reserve from capital contributions furthermore generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to our shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder unless the distribution is made to shareholders i by way of a reduction of par value or ii assuming certain conditions are met out of qualifying contributed surplus  kapitaleinlage  accumulated on or after january 1 1997 payments may be made out of registered share capitalthe aggregate par value of a companys registered sharesonly by way of a capital reduction tycos distributable reserves based on its swiss statutory account for fiscal year 2013 are chf 25 billion and its registered share capital is approximately chf 243 million tycos distributable reserves will be reduced by any additional distributions approved by our shareholders including any ordinary cash dividends approved by our shareholders at the annual general meeting in march 2014 

if we are not successful in our efforts to make dividends through a reduction of par value or out of qualifying contributed surplus then any dividends paid by us generally will be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income which we refer to as the usswiss treaty may apply for a refund of the tax 

withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds even if we are able to pay dividends in the future there can be no assurance that we will meet the requirements to pay such dividends free from swiss withholding tax or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future we cannot provide assurance that the current swiss law with respect to distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus will not be changed or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions in addition over the long term the amount of par value available to us for par value reductions and the amount of qualifying contributed surplus available to us to pay out as distributions is limited 

under present swiss tax laws repurchases of shares for the purposes of cancellation are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the repurchase price and the par value except since january 1 2011 to the extent attributable to qualifying contributed surplus  kapitaleinlagereserven  if any if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves the swiss withholding becomes due no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares however should such treasury shares remain in treasury for six years the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period

environmental matters 

tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 27 2013  tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 74 million  to 162 million  as of september 27 2013  tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 105 million  of which 82 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and accounts payable and 23 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet 

the majority of the liabilities described above relate to ongoing remediation efforts at a facility in the companys global products segment located in marinette wisconsin which the company acquired in 1990 in connection with its acquisition of among other things the ansul product line prior to tycos acquisition ansul manufactured arsenicbased agricultural herbicides at the marinette facility which resulted in significant arsenic contamination of soil and groundwater on the marinette site and in parts of the adjoining menominee river ansul has been engaged in ongoing remediation efforts at the marinette site since 1990 and in february 2009 entered into an administrative consent order the consent order with the us environmental protection agency to address the presence of arsenic at the marinette site under this agreement ansuls principal obligations are to contain the arsenic contamination on the site pump and treat onsite groundwater dredge treat and 

properly dispose of contaminated sediments in the adjoining river areas and monitor contamination levels on an ongoing basis activities completed under the consent order since 2009 include the installation of a subsurface barrier wall around the facility to contain contaminated groundwater the installation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system and the dredging and offsite disposal of treated river sediment as a result of treatability studies concluded during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 the company became aware that additional river sediment beyond what was originally planned would require treatment under the consent order for river sediment remediation this caused the company to increase its agreed upon remedial activities through the fall of 2013 in order to achieve compliance with the consent order during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the deadline for completing the remediation was extended through december 31 2013 and the company intends to complete the activities required under the consent order within the extended timeframe as a result of the increased level of remediation required the company recorded a charge of approximately 100 million  in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations during the first half of the year ended september 27 2013 as of september 27 2013  the company concluded that its remaining remediation and monitoring costs related to the marinette facility were in the range of approximately 62 million  to 137 million  the companys best estimate within that range is approximately 93 million  of which 79 million  is included in accrued and other current liabilities and accounts payable and 14 million  is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet the company recorded 17 million   and 11 million during the years ended september 28 2012  and september 30 2011  respectively within selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations since fiscal 2009 the year in which the company received the consent order the company has incurred environmental remediation costs net of insurance recoveries of 132 million  although the company has recorded its best estimate of the costs that it will incur to remediate and monitor the arsenic contamination at the marinette facility it is possible that technological regulatory or enforcement developments the results of environmental studies or other factors could change the companys expectations with respect to future charges and cash outlays and such changes could be material to the companys future results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos containing components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while the company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesothelioma related claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts the companys historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed the company cannot predict the extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future in addition the company continues to assess its strategy for resolving asbestos claims due to the number of claims and limited amount of assets held by yarway corporation yarway one of the companys indirect subsidiaries on april 22 2013 yarway filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware as a result of this filing all asbestos claims against yarway have been stayed pending confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court yarways goal is to negotiate obtain approval of and consummate a plan of reorganization that establishes an appropriately funded trust to provide for the fair and equitable payment of legitimate current and future yarway asbestos claims accompanied by appropriate injunctive relief permanently protecting yarway and certain other protected parties from any further asbestos claims arising from products manufactured sold andor distributed by yarway upon confirmation of such plan of reorganization the company expects to deconsolidate yarway as a result of filing the voluntary petition during the year the company recorded an expected loss upon deconsolidation of 10 million  related to the yarway bankruptcy petition although the terms of yarways plan of reorganization are unknown at this time the company does not expect them to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

as of september 27 2013  the company has determined that there were approximately 5200  claims pending against it its subsidiaries or entities for which the company has assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions and divestitures this amount reflects the companys current estimate of the number of viable claims made against such entities and includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identify incorrect defendants are duplicative of other actions or for which the company is indemnified 

 the companys estimate of its liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made in the future during a defined period of time the lookforward period on a quarterly basis the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability 

for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy it also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on a quarterly basis the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 the company determined that a lookback period of three years  was more appropriate than a five  year period because the company had experienced a higher and more consistent level of claims activity and settlement costs in the past three years the company also revised its lookforward period from seven years  to fifteen years  or 2027 the companys decision to revise its lookforward period was primarily based on improvements in the consistency of observable data and the companys more extensive experience with asbestos claims since the lookforward period was originally established in 2005 the revisions to the companys lookforward and lookback periods were not applied to claims made against yarway excluding these claims the company believed it could make a more reliable estimate of pending and future claims beyond seven years the company believes valuation of pending claims and future claims to be filed through 2027 produced a reasonable estimate of its asbestos liability which it recorded in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis the effect of the change in the companys lookback and lookforward periods reduced income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income by approximately 90 million  and 55 million  respectively in addition the effect of the change increased the companys basic and diluted loss from continuing operations by 012  per share and decreased the companys basic and diluted net income by 012  per share 

the companys estimate of asbestos related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims in determining the amount of insurance recoverable the company considers a number of factors including available insurance allocation methodologies and the solvency and creditworthiness of insurers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 the company reached an agreement with one of its primary insurance carriers for asbestos related claims under the terms of the settlement the company agreed with the insurance carrier to accept a lump sum cash payment of 97 million  in respect of certain policies and has reached a coverageinplace agreement with the insurance carrier with respect to certain claims upon receipt of the payments from the insurance carrier in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the company terminated a costsharing agreement that it had entered into with an entity that it had acquired a business from several decades ago and as a result has access to all of the insurance policies and is responsible for all liabilities arising from asbestos claims made against the subsidiary that was acquired 

as of september 27 2013  the companys estimated net liability of 169 million  was recorded within the companys consolidated balance sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of 321 million  and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of 152 million  the company believes that its asbestos related liabilities and insurance related assets as of september 27 2013  are appropriate similarly as of september 28 2012  the companys estimated net liability of 155 million  was recorded within the companys consolidated balance sheet as a liability for pending and future claims and related defense costs of 401 million  and separately as an asset for insurance recoveries of 246 million  

the net liabilities reflected in the companys consolidated balance sheet represent the companys best estimates of probable losses for the lookforward periods described above it is reasonably possible that losses will be incurred for claims made subsequent to such lookforward periods however due to the inherent uncertainty and lack of reliable trend data in predicting losses beyond 2027 the company is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of losses beyond such date accordingly no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be incurred for claims which may be made subsequent to 2027 with respect to claims made against yarway the company is unable to reasonably estimate losses beyond what it has accrued because it is uncertain what the impact of yarways reorganization plan under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code will be on the company however the company does not expect the impact to be materially adverse to its financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the amounts recorded by the company for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets are based on the companys strategies for resolving its asbestos claims currently available information and a number of estimates and assumptions key variables and assumptions include the number and type of new claims that are filed each year the average cost of resolution of claims the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers amount of insurance and the solvency risk with respect to the companys insurance carriers many of these factors are closely linked such that a change in one variable or assumption will impact one or more of the others and no single variable or assumption predominately influences the determination of the companys asbestosrelated liabilities and insurancerelated assets furthermore predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty in the later portion of the projection period other factors that may affect the companys liability and cash payments for asbestosrelated matters include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case reforms of state or federal tort legislation and the applicability of 

insurance policies among subsidiaries as a result actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the companys calculations vary significantly from actual results 

income tax matters 

tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to years preceding the 2007 separation the issues and proposed adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the sharing provisions of a tax sharing agreement entered in 2007 with covidien and te connectivity the 2007 tax sharing agreement under which tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns the costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties tyco has previously disclosed that in connection with us federal tax audits the irs has raised a number of issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year although tyco has been able to resolve substantially all of the issues and adjustments proposed by the irs for tax years through 2007 it has not been able to resolve matters related to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions during the period as a result on june 20 2013 tyco received notices of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of tycos former us subsidiaries owe additional taxes of 8833 million plus penalties of 154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time in addition tyco received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million is expected to be asserted these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs position described below is ultimately proved correct 

the irs asserted in the notices of deficiency that substantially all of tycos intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and has disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on us income tax returns totaling approximately 29 billion tyco strongly disagrees with the irs position and has filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments tyco believes that it has meritorious defenses for its tax filings that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations and that the previously reported taxes for the years in question are appropriate 

no payments with respect to these matters would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on the experience of other companies could take several years tyco believes that its income tax reserves and the liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for the tax sharing agreements continue to be appropriate however the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on tycos financial condition results of operations and cash flows in particular if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion which is expected to be disallowed by the irs 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies related to tycos income taxes see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

compliance matters 

as previously reported in the companys periodic filings in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 the company settled with the department of justice doj and the sec charges related to alleged improper payments made by the companys subsidiaries and agents in recent years and agreed to pay approximately 26 million in fines disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the doj and sec which the company had previously reserved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the company paid the doj approximately 13 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and paid approximately 13 million to the sec in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 

covidien and te connectivity agreed in connection with the 2007 separation to cooperate with the company in its responses regarding these matters and agreed that liabilities primarily related to the former healthcare and electronics businesses of the company would be assigned to covidien and te connectivity respectively as a result covidien and te connectivity have agreed to contribute approximately 5 million and immaterial amounts respectively toward the aforementioned 26 million 

other matters 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 an adverse judgment was entered by the united states district court for the district of colorado regarding an insurance claim made on behalf of sonitrol corporation a former subsidiary of the company for insurance coverage for damages arising from a burglary and fire occurring at a warehouse monitored by sonitrol in 

december 2002 the judgment reversed the district courts prior finding that sonitrols actions were not the type of conduct that was uninsurable based on public policy grounds as a result the company reversed an insurance receivable of 265 million within selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended june 28 2013 the company is appealing the district courts ruling to the united states circuit court for the tenth circuit and will retry the underlying damages action against sonitrol in colorado state court 

in addition to the foregoing the company is subject to claims and suits including from time to time contractual disputes and product and general liability claims incidental to present and former operations acquisitions and dispositions with respect to many of these claims the company either selfinsures or maintains insurance through thirdparties with varying deductibles while the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty the company believes that the resolution of any such proceedings whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows beyond amounts recorded for such matters

 net revenue 

fiscal   2013   

net revenue for the year ended september 27 2013   increased  by 244 million  or 23  to 10647 million  as compared to net revenue of 10403 million  for the year ended september 28 2012  on an organic basis net revenue grew by 130 

million  or 13  year over year primarily as a result of revenue growth in our global products segment and to a lesser extent in our row installation  services segment partially offset by a decline in our na installation  services segment driven by our security business net revenue was favorably impacted by acquisitions of 168 million  or 16  primarily within our row installation  services and global products segments changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in our row installation  services segment unfavorably impacted net revenue by 55 million  or 05  net revenue growth was also unfavorably impacted by divestitures of 38 million  or 04  primarily in our na and row installation  services segments 

fiscal   2012

operating income

operating income for the year ended september 28 2012   decreased   297 million  or 302  to 685 million  as compared to operating income of 982 million  for the year ended september 30 2011  operating income for the year ended september 28 2012  declined primarily due to the net gain on divestitures of 224 million that was recognized in the prior year primarily related to a 248 million net gain related to the sale of a majority interest in the companys former electrical and metal products business 

items impacting operating income for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  are as follows

income loss from continuing operations attributable to tyco common shareholders 

interest income and expense 

interest income was 17 million  in 2013  as compared to 19 million  and 27 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively interest income decreased in 2013  primarily due to decreased investment yields compared to 2012  and 2011  

interest expense was 100 million  in 2013  as compared to 209 million  and 240 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively the weightedaverage interest rate on total debt outstanding was 65 as of both september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  and 59 as of september 30 2011  the decreases in interest expense and fluctuations in the weightedaverage interest rate are primarily related to savings realized from the 26 billion debt redemptions in 2012 and from the replacement of higher coupon notes with lower coupon notes during 2011 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other expense net 

other expense net was 29 million  in 2013 as compared to 454 million  and 5 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively other expense net decreased in 2013  due to the loss on extinguishment of debt of 453 million that was recorded during 2012 

effective income tax rate 

our effective income tax rate was 179  during the year ended september 27 2013  our effective tax rate is affected by the mix of jurisdictions in which income is earned our effective tax rate for the year was favorably impacted by the impact on taxes of the environmental remediation charges incurred during the second quarter of 2013 partially offset by tax sharing agreement adjustments incurred throughout the year and enacted tax law changes in the fourth quarter of 2013 

 our effective income tax rate for the year ended september 28 2012  was not meaningful primarily as a result of separation related charges which were incurred for which no tax benefit was recognized as well as a valuation allowance of 235 million recorded due to net operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize in future periods additionally our effective income tax rate for the year ended september 28 2012  was impacted by enacted tax law changes favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions and a nonrecurring item generating a tax benefit 

our effective income tax rate was 175  during the year ended september 30 2011  the effective income tax rate was impacted by a tax charge recorded in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in our electrical and metal products business during the first quarter of 2011 the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions during 2011 

the rate can vary from period to period due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 20 billion and 18 billion as of september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions specifically the valuation allowance as of september 27 2013 and september 282012 includes separation related charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt which further increased a net operating loss carryforward which the company does not expect to realize in future periods the valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when the company determined that it was morelikelythannot that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized the company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the companys consolidated balance sheets 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

depreciation and amortization methods for security monitoringrelated assets —tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories internally generated residential subscriber systems outside of north america internally generated commercial subscriber systems collectively referred to as subscriber system assets and customer accounts acquired through the adt dealer program primarily outside of north america referred to as dealer intangibles subscriber system assets include installed property plant and equipment for which tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber in certain geographical areas where the company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time the company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition the company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years the accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 135 to 360 for commercial subscriber pools and dealer intangibles and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method the company uses a straightline method with a 14year life for nonpooled subscriber system assets primarily in europe latin america and asia and related deferred revenue with remaining balances written off upon customer termination 

revenue recognition —contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems large security intruder systems and other constructionrelated projects are recorded primarily under the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion the risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in longterm contracts provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable 

sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements including equipment installation monitoring services and maintenance agreements we assess our revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting when ownership of the system is transferred to the customer each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery installation and customer acceptance is completed while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe or tpe is available revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the noncontingent upfront consideration received at the time of installation since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services 

product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct indirect and other market participants rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis 

loss contingencies —accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables —we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials we estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made in the future during a defined period of time the lookforward period on a quarterly basis the company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed settled and dismissed and amounts paid in settlements in addition to claims and settlement experience the company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation the legal environment and the companys defense strategy the company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on a quarterly basis the company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters we record asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims in determining the amount of insurance recoverable we consider available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

insurable liabilities —the company records liabilities for its workers compensation product general and auto liabilities the determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience for most of these liabilities claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience certain insurable liabilities are discounted using a riskfree rate of return when the pattern and timing of the future obligation is reliably determinable the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes —in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is morelikelythannot the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairments —goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur in performing these assessments management relies on and considers a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable market transactions to the extent available other market data and the companys overall market capitalization 

we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates discounted using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for market participants a market approach utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction to the extent available is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss in the second step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 

we recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows 

 while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values if our assumptions are not realized it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded however it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 

longlived assets —asset groups held and used by the company including property plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairments to longlived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets the calculation of the fair value of longlived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates 

reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of longlived assets there is a risk that the carrying value of our longlived assets may be overstated or understated 

pension and postretirement benefits —our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses for active plans such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately 79 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately 2 million we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class historical performance of asset classes over longterm periods asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected longterm return on plan assets a 25 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately 5 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

a fundamental objective of the company is to have sufficient liquidity balance sheet strength and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the world the primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations in addition we maintain a commercial paper program have access to a committed revolving credit facility and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources we continue to balance our operating investing and financing uses of cash through investments and acquisitions in our core businesses dividends and share repurchases in addition we believe our cash position amounts available under our credit facility commercial paper program and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs in the foreseeable future 

as of september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  our cash and cash equivalents short and longterm debt and tyco shareholders equity are as follows 

the company expects to pay i approximately 100 million within the next 12 months to settle intercompany liabilities due to yarway and ii 163 million to settle certain pre2012 separation related tax liabilities although the timing and amounts of these payments are subject to a number of uncertainties the company expects to issue up to 500 million of longterm debt throughout fiscal 2014 to ensure that sufficient funds are available on a costeffective basis for these and other general corporate purposes see notes 13 and 6 respectively to the consolidated financial statements

management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and operational business needs for the foreseeable future including capital expenditures quarterly dividend payments and share repurchases 

commitments and contingencies 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies related to tax and litigation matters and governmental investigations see notes 6 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable operating leases and purchase obligations as of september 27 2013 are as follows  in millions 

 

 as of september 27 2013  we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of 257 million and gross interest and penalties of 41 million we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the remaining payments in future years therefore such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table however based on the current status of our income tax audits we believe that it is reasonably possible that between nil and 30 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months although the company had unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate the company had net operating loss carryforwards which would offset the cash impact of any such recognition of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the current year 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in connection with the 2012 separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against tyco prior to the 2012 separation under the 2012 tax sharing agreement pentair tyco and adt share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tyco flow controls tycos and adts us income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement excluding approximately 175 million of pre2012 separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 separation collectively shared tax liabilities the company will be responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities pentair and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities pentair adt and tyco will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million the company expects to pay 163 million to settle certain pre2012 separation related tax liabilities the timing and amounts of these payments are subject to a number of uncertainties and could change see notes 13 and 6 respectively to the consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the 2007 separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against tyco prior to the 2007 separation under the 2007 separation and distribution agreement and 2007 tax sharing agreement we have assumed 27 covidien has assumed 42 and te connectivity has assumed 31 of certain tyco preseparation contingent and other corporate liabilities which as of september 27 2013  primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spinoffs or the distributions made or brought by any third party 

backlog 

we had a backlog of unfilled orders of 5326 million and 5142 million as of september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  respectively 

the companys backlog includes recurring revenueinforce and longterm deferred revenue for upfront fees from its na and row installation  services segments revenueinforce represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security and fire business backlog by segment was as follows  in millions 

backlog increased 184 million or 36 to 5326 million as of september 27 2013  as compared to 5142 million in the prior year the net increase in backlog as of september 27 2013 was due to a 211 million increase in total backlog in our row installation  services segment partially offset by a 64 million decrease in total backlog in our na installation  services segment the increase in total backlog as of september 27 2013 in our row installation  services segment was primarily due to a 106 million increase in recurring revenueinforce across all regions as well as a 105 million increase in backlog across all regions driven in part by acquisitions in our asiapacific region the decrease in total backlog as of september 27 2013 in our na installation  services segment was driven by a 47 million decrease in backlog a 12 million increase in recurring revenueinforce and a 29 million decrease in deferred revenue as a result of continued pressure in our north america security business partially offset by improvements in our north america fire business changes in foreign currency had an unfavorable impact on backlog of 67 million or 13 

guarantees 

certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of thirdparties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees if required would not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

there are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among tyco covidien te connectivity adt and pentair in accordance with the terms of the 2007 and 2012 separation and distribution agreements and the tax sharing agreements the guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the tax sharing agreements at the time of the 2007 and 2012 separations we recorded liabilities necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax sharing agreements in addition prior to the 2007 and 2012 separations we provided support in the form of financial andor performance guarantees to various covidien te connectivity adt and tyco flow control operating entities to the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the 2007 and 2012 separations we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including for example unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to 

investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance we record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as of september 27 2013  we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately 424 million

nonus gaap measure 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by us gaap we also disclose the nonus gaap measure of organic revenue growth decline we believe that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented when read in conjunction with our us gaap revenue it enables investors to better evaluate our operations without giving effect to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and acquisition and divestiture activity either of which may be significant from period to period in addition organic revenue growth decline is a factor we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business this measure is not a financial measure under us gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue as determined in accordance with us gaap and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies organic revenue growth decline presented herein is defined as revenue growth decline excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations acquisitions and divestitures and other changes that may not reflect underlying results and trends for example the 53 rd week of operations in fiscal year 2011 our organic growth decline calculations incorporate an estimate of prior year reported net revenue associated with acquired entities that have been fully integrated within the first year and exclude prior year net revenue associated with entities that do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations which have been divested within the past year adjusted number we calculate the rate of organic growth decline based on the adjusted number to better reflect the rate of growth decline of the combined business in the case of acquisitions or the remaining business in the case of dispositions we base the rate of organic growth decline for acquired businesses that are not fully integrated within the first year upon unadjusted historical net revenue foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by subtracting i the us dollar equivalent of local currencies for the current period using monthly weighted average exchange rates for the prior period from ii the us dollar equivalent of local currencies for the current period using monthly weighted average exchange rates for the current period we may use organic revenue growth decline as a component of our compensation programs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of conducting business we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices accordingly we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject we seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may from time to time include forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency options interest rate swaps commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated nonfunctional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so 

we do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us we only enter into contracts with counterparties having strong investment grade longterm credit ratings from standard  poors and moodys these counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party 

foreign currency exposures 

we hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to operating entities through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts additionally for our corporate financing entities we manage the foreign currency exposure through a combination of multicurrency notional pool and forward contracts our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar mexican peso and korean won against the us dollar the market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contract is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on september 27 2013  a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 11 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 14 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 

prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we hedged net investments in certain foreign operations through the use of foreign currency exchange forward contracts the objective was to minimize the exposure to changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated net investment as of the quarter ended december 30 2011 we terminated our net investment hedge accordingly the aggregate notional amount of these hedges was nil for both september 27 2013 and september 28 2012 

as of both september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  20 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature for the fiscal years ended september 27 2013  september 28 2012  and september 30 2011  we recorded 3 million and 48 million of cumulative translation gain and 2 million of a cumulative translation loss respectively through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans 

interest rate exposures 

we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes since the third quarter of 2009 tifsa has been entering into interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixedrate debt to variable rates in these contracts tifsa agrees with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in connection with the debt tenders and redemption during the quarter ended september 28 2012 tifsa settled all outstanding interest rate swaps accordingly as of september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  the total gross notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts was nil for both periods

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined under exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

segments 

as a result of the 2012 separation we now operate and report financial and operating information in three new segments na installation  services row installation  services and global products certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 

each of our segments serves a highly diverse customer base and none is dependent upon a single customer or group of customers for fiscal year 2012 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenues and approximately 50 of our revenues were derived from customers outside of north america 

our enduse customers to whom we may sell directly or through wholesalers distributors commercial builders or contractors can generally be grouped in the following categories 

• commercial customers including residential and commercial property developers financial institutions food service businesses and commercial enterprises • industrial customers including companies in the oil and gas power generation mining petrochemical and other industries • retail customers including international regional and local consumer outlets • institutional customers including a broad range of healthcare facilities academic institutions museums and foundations 4 

• governmental customers including federal state and local governments defense installations mass transportation networks public utilities and other governmentaffiliated entities and applications and • residential and small business customers outside of north america including owners of singlefamily homes and local providers of a wide range of goods and services as discussed under competition below the markets in which we compete are generally highly fragmented we therefore compete with many other businesses in markets throughout the world including other large global businesses significant regional businesses and many smaller local businesses 

installation  services 

na installation  services and row installation  services collectively installation  services designs sells installs services and monitors electronic security and fire detection and suppression systems for retail commercial industrial governmental and institutional customers around the world additionally row installation  services designs sells installs services and monitors security systems for residential and small business customers under the adt brand name outside of north america 

security services 

our installation  services segments design sell install and service security systems to detect intrusion control access and react to movement fire smoke flooding environmental conditions industrial processes and other hazards these electronic security systems include detection devices that are usually connected to a monitoring center that receives and records alarm signals where security monitoring specialists verify alarm conditions and initiate a range of response scenarios for most systems control panels identify the nature of the alarm and the areas where a sensor was triggered our other security solutions include access control systems for sensitive areas such as government facilities and banks video surveillance systems designed to deter theft and fraud and help protect employees and customers and asset protection and security management systems designed to monitor and protect physical assets as well as proprietary electronic data our offerings also include antitheft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry as well as store performance solutions to enhance retailer performance many of the worlds leading retailers use our sensormatic antitheft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft many of the products that we install for our installation  services security customers are designed and manufactured by our global products segment additionally our deep experience in designing integrating deploying and maintaining largescale security systems—including for example centrally managed security systems that span large commercial and institutional campuses—allows us to install andor service products manufactured by third parties 

purchasers of our intrusion systems typically contract for ongoing security system monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation these contracts are generally for a term of one to three years systems installed at customers premises may be owned by us or by our customers monitoring center personnel may respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to local fire or police departments notifying the customer or taking other appropriate action in certain markets we directly provide the alarm response services with highly trained and professionally equipped employees in some instances alarm systems are connected directly to local fire or police departments 

in addition our row installation  services segment is a leading provider of monitored residential and small business security systems in addition to traditional burglar alarm and fire detection systems installation and monitoring services row installation  services provides patrol and response services in select geographies including south africa and korea our row 

installation  services segment continues to expand its offering of valueadded residential services worldwide such as an interactive services platform the interactive services platform allows for remote management of the home security system as well as lifestyle applications which currently include remote video lighting control and energy management 

our customers are often prompted to purchase security systems by their insurance carriers which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that a system be installed as a condition of coverage 

fire protection services 

our installation  services segments design sell install and service fire detection and fire suppression systems in both new and existing facilities commercial construction as well as legislation mandating the installation and service of fire detection and suppression systems drives the demand for our products our installation  services segments offer a wide range of fire detection and suppression systems including those designed and manufactured by our global products segment and those designed by third parties these detection systems include fire alarm control panels advanced fire alarm monitoring systems smoke flame detection systems heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems our installation  services segments also offer a wide range of standard waterbased sprinkler and chemical suppression systems and custom designed special hazard suppression systems which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams dry chemicals and gases in addition to spill control products designed to absorb neutralize and solidify spills of hazardous materials these systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications including oil and gas power generation mining petrochemical manufacturing transportation data processing telecommunications commercial food preparation and marine applications our installation  services segments continue to focus on system maintenance and inspection which have become increasingly important parts of our business 

customers 

our installation  services customers range from fortune 500 companies with diverse worldwide operations who look to us to provide integrated global solutions for their fire and security needs to single location commercial customers and individual homeowners our installation  services customer relationships generally are in the market for new construction or retrofit projects which represented 45 of installation  services fiscal 2012 net revenue and the market for aftermarket products and services which accounted for the remaining 55 of installation  services fiscal 2012 net revenue new construction projects are inherently longlead in nature and we strive to become involved in the planning process for these projects as early as possible we believe that by actively participating in the preliminary design stages of a new construction project and by offering our design services that combine our global expertise and knowledge of local codes and standards we can increase our value to customers relative to many smaller local and regional competitors with respect to fire detection and suppression installations we prefer to become involved at the time an architectural or engineering design firm is selected with respect to security system design and installation we generally become involved in the later stages of a construction project or as tenants take occupancy 

our relationships with customers in the aftermarket may include any combination of alarm monitoring fire and security maintenance and or testing and inspection services we also provide aftermarket services to many customers whose fire and security systems were manufactured or installed by third parties 

global products 

our global products segment designs manufactures and sells fire protection security and life safety products including intrusion security antitheft devices breathing apparatus and access control and video management systems 

fire protection products 

fire protection products designs manufactures distributes and sells fire alarm and fire detection systems automatic fire sprinkler systems and special hazard suppression systems including many of the fire protection products that our installation  services segments install and service fire protection products also manufactures and sells grooved products for the rapid joining of piping in both the fire and nonfire markets fire protection products are marketed under various leading trade names including simplex wormald ansul grinnell and tyco and include fire alarm control panels advanced fire alarm monitoring systems smoke heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems fire protection products also offers a wide range of waterbased sprinkler systems and custom designed special hazard suppression systems which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams dry chemicals and gases these systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications including oil and gas power generation mining petrochemical manufacturing transportation data processing telecommunications commercial food preparation and marine applications 

fire protection products systems typically are purchased by facility owners through construction engineers and electrical contractors as well as mechanical or general contractors in recent years retrofitting of existing buildings has grown as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems especially in hotels restaurants healthcare facilities and educational establishments in september 2008 the international residential code council a nonprofit association that develops model codes that are the predominant building and fire safety regulations used by state and local jurisdictions in the united states adopted a proposal advanced by firefighters and other lifesafety advocates that requires sprinkler systems in new one and two family dwellings as of january 2011 this national code is not binding on state and local jurisdictions and must be adopted locally before it becomes mandatory for new homes being built in these areas the timing of adoption if at all will vary by jurisdiction however we believe that this development may offer opportunities to expand our residential fire suppression business in the united states 

security products 

security products designs and manufactures a wide array of electronic security products including integrated video surveillance and access control systems to enable businesses to manage their security and enhance business performance our global access control solutions include integrated security management systems for enterprise applications access control solutions applications alarm management panels door controllers readers keypads and cards our global video system solutions include digital video management systems matrix switchers and controllers digital multiplexers programmable cameras monitors and liquid crystal interactive displays our security products for homes and businesses range from basic burglar alarms to comprehensive interactive security systems including alarm control panels keypads sensors and central station receiving equipment used in security monitoring centers our offerings also include antitheft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry our security products are marketed under various leading trade names including software house dsc american dynamics sensormatic and visonic  many of the worlds leading retailers use our sensormatic antitheft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft security products manufactures many of the security products that our installation  services business installs and services 

life safety products 

life safety products manufactures life safety products including selfcontained breathing apparatus designed for firefighter industrial and military use supplied air respirators airpurifying respirators thermal imaging cameras gas detection equipment gas masks and personal protection equipment the life safety products business operates under various leading trade names including scott safety and protector  our breathing apparatus are used by the military forces of several countries and many us firefighters rely on the scott airpak brand of selfcontained breathing apparatus 

customers 

global products sells products through our installation  service segments and indirect distribution channels around the world some of global products channel business partners act as dealers selling to smaller fire and security contractors that install fire detection and suppression security and theft protection systems whereas others act as integrators that install the products themselves builders contractors and developers are customers for our sprinkler products end customers for our breathing apparatus and related products include fire departments municipal and state governments and military forces as well as major companies in the industrial sector 

competition 

the markets that we serve are generally highly competitive and fragmented with a small number of large global firms and thousands of smaller regional and local companies competition is based on price specialized product capacity breadth of product line training support and delivery with the relative importance of these factors varying depending on the project complexity product line the local market and other factors rather than compete primarily on price we emphasize the quality of our products and services the reputation of our brands and our knowledge of customers fire and security needs among large industrial commercial governmental and institutional customers we believe that our comprehensive global coverage and product and service offerings provide a competitive advantage we also believe that our systems integration capabilities which allow us to offer global solutions to customers that fully integrate our security andor fire offerings into existing information technology networks business operations and management tools and process automation and control systems set us apart from all but a small number of other large global competitors 

competitive dynamics in the fire and security industry generally result in more direct competition and lower margins for installation projects compared to aftermarket products and services we generally face the greatest competitive pricing pressure for the installation of products that have become more commoditized over time including standard commercial sprinkler systems and closedcircuit television systems 

backlog 

see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information relating to our backlog 

intellectual property 

patents trademarks copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including trademarks patents and patent applications in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and misappropriation of our proprietary rights and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to electronic security systems fire protection products and systems including fire detection and fire suppression with chemical gas foam and water agents personal protective products and systems for fire and other hazards integrated systems for surveillance and control of public transportation and other public works we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks 

while we consider our patents to be valuable assets that help prevent or delay the commoditization of our products and thus extend their life cycles we do not believe that our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents we share the adt® trademark with adt and operate under a brand governance agreement between the two companies for further details see the description under trademark agreement under item 13 certain relationships and related transactions and director independence 

research and development 

we are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate for example in order to position ourselves to participate in and lead the development of residential interactive platforms enterprisewide integrated access control platforms and transition ip video platforms we have made significant investments in our security products portfolio in addition we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment our research and development expense was 145 million in 2012 129 million in 2011 and 113 million in 2010 related to new product development 

raw and other purchased materials 

we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including fuel for our vehicle fleet we purchase materials from a large number of independent sources around the world and have experienced no shortages that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses we enter into longterm supply contracts using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions significant changes in certain raw material including steel brass and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression agents may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the united states in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries our security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals wireline and wireless telephone companies in the united states are regulated by the federal and state governments in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our fire businesses these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations both favorably and unfavorably for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors—risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters and item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and the health and safety of our employees 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations 

given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 48 million to 60 million as of september 28 2012 as of september 28 2012 we concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 50 million of which 43 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 7 million is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet in view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of september 28 2012 we employed more than 70000 people worldwide of which approximately 20000 were employed in the united states and approximately 50000 were outside the united states approximately 10000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as technological obsolescence labor relations geopolitical events climate change and international operations 

risks relating to our businesses 

  general economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of certain markets that we serve for example demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial and residential construction industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance and the amount of discretionary business and consumer spending each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality even if demand for our products is not negatively affected the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full andor on a timely basis 

much of the demand for installation of security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential construction and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects commercial and residential construction projects are heavily dependent on general economic conditions localized demand for commercial and residential real estate and availability of credit many commercial and residential real estate markets have experienced excess capacity since the beginning of the global financial crisis and in some markets demand may not improve significantly for years if at all in addition most commercial and residential real estate developers rely heavily on project financing from banks and other institutional lenders in order to initiate and complete projects the decline in real estate values in many parts of the world that accompanied the global financial crisis has led to significant reductions in the availability of project financing even in markets where demand may otherwise be sufficient to support new construction these factors have in turn hampered demand for new fire detection and suppression and security installations 

levels of industrial capital expenditures for facility expansions and maintenance turn on general economic conditions economic conditions within specific industries we serve expectations of future market behavior and available financing additionally volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 

the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including greenfield construction expensive 

maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services although our industrial customers tend to be less dependent on project financing than real estate developers disruptions in financial markets and banking systems could make credit and capital markets difficult for our customers to access and could raise the cost of new debt for our customers to prohibitive levels any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects including necessary maintenance and upgrades even during periods of favorable endmarket conditions 

many of our customers outside of the industrial and commercial sectors including governmental and institutional customers have experienced budgetary constraints as sources of revenue including tax receipts general obligation and construction bonds endowments and donations have been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions these budgetary constraints have in the past and may in the future reduce demand for our products among governmental and institutional customers 

reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the industries we serve any of these results could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  we face competition in each of our businesses which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products if we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

we operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service providers both domestically and on a global basis our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from alternative service providers around the world currently key components of our competitive position are our ability to bring to market industryleading products and services to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully these factors require continuous management focus on maintaining our competitive position through technological innovation cost reduction productivity improvement and a regular appraisal of our asset portfolio if we are unable to maintain our position as a market leader or to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or costeffectiveness or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by evolving industry standards although many of our largest competitors are also global industrial companies we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours particularly in emerging markets or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate we have found that in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses 

accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire manufacture and bring competitive products and services to market quickly and costeffectively adapting our businesses to serve more local markets will require us to invest considerable resources in building our distribution channels and engineering and manufacturing capabilities in those markets to ensure that we can address customer demand even when we invest in growing our business in local markets we may not be successful for any number of reasons including competitive pressure from regional and local businesses that may have superior local capabilities or products that are produced more locally at lower cost our ability to develop or acquire new products and services can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the design of a product or in its application to a specified use which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products as a result these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand images could suffer in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure to effectively adapt our products and services to the needs of local markets the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance the potential for product defects or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  we are exposed to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failure than may be inherent in other businesses 

if a customer or third party believes that he or she has suffered harm to person or property due to an actual or alleged act or omission of one of our employees or a security or fire system failure he or she may pursue legal action against us and the cost of defending the legal action and of any judgment could be substantial in particular because our products and services are intended to protect lives and real and personal property we may have greater exposure to litigation risks than businesses that provide other consumer and small business products and services we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our installation service and monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances however in the event of litigation with respect to such matters it is possible that these limitations may be deemed not applicable or unenforceable 

  we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business 

our business operates and serves consumers worldwide there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

• economic volatility and the current global economic recession • the difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets especially our intellectual property rights through nonus legal systems • possibility of unfavorable circumstances from host country laws or regulations 13 

• fluctuations in revenues operating margins and other financial measures due to currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency and earnings repatriation • trade protection measures import or export restrictions licensing requirements and local fire and security codes and standards • increased costs and risks of developing staffing and simultaneously managing a number of foreign operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences • issues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations • potentially adverse tax developments • longer payment cycles • changes in the general political social and economic conditions in the countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets • the threat of nationalization and expropriation • the presence of corruption in certain countries and • fluctuations in available municipal funding in those instances where a project is government financed one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

in order to manage our daytoday operations we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices in addition we are required to create compensation programs employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures any of which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue and certain of our costs assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure have undergone significant devaluation in the past which can reduce the value of our local monetary assets reduce the us dollar value of our local cash flow and potentially reduce the us dollar value of future local net income although we intend to enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of our risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we are a large buyer of metals and other nonmetal commodities including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method 

we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we may enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations these hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform as a result changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of management time and attention from daily operations • difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business • inability to obtain required regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms • potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us • assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and • dilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

  a significant percentage of our future growth is anticipated to come from emerging markets and if we are unable to expand our operations in emerging markets our growth rate could be negatively affected 

one aspect of our growth strategy is to seek significant growth in emerging markets including china india latin america and the middle east which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks than more mature markets where legal systems are more developed and familiar to us in some cases emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions are more susceptible to corruption and are locations where it may be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures negative or uncertain political climates in developing and emerging markets could also adversely affect us 

we cannot guarantee that our growth strategy will be successful if we are unable to manage the risks inherent in our growth strategy in emerging markets including civil unrest international hostilities natural disasters security breaches and failure to maintain compliance with multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

  failure to maintain and upgrade the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and other information noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information or a violation of the companys privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and in the normal course of our business we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers stockholders and employees the legal regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cybercriminals around the world a significant actual or potential theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of customer stockholder employee or our data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines litigation or regulatory action against us in addition we depend on our information technology infrastructure for businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations increasingly our security products and services are accessed through the internet and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services via the internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services 

we are continuously upgrading and consolidating our systems including making changes to legacy systems replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders potential disruption of our internal control structure substantial capital expenditures additional administration and operating expenses retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation or at all in addition the implementation of new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated 

  if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  failure to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 

our culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training motivating and developing employees and in particular we strive to attract motivate train and retain qualified engineers and managers to handle the daytoday operations of a highly diversified organization many of our manufacturing processes and many of the integrated solutions we offer are highly technical in nature our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire train and retain engineers and other technical professionals with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for resources is intense our geographic expansion strategy in emerging markets depends on our ability to attract retain and integrate qualified managers and engineers if we fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  we may be required to recognize substantial impairment charges in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to assess our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets periodically to determine whether they are impaired disruptions to our business unfavorable endmarket conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in material charges for goodwill and other asset impairments we maintain significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet and we believe these balances are recoverable however fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected with the annual impairment analysis future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  our residential and commercial security businesses may experience higher rates of customer attrition which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers increasing our depreciation and amortization expense 

if our residential security customers located outside of north america or our commercial security customers are dissatisfied with our products or services and switch to competitive products or services or disconnect for other reasons our recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide we amortize the costs of acquired monitoring contracts and related customer relationships based on the estimated life of the customer relationships internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated if customer disconnect rates were to rise significantly we may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain 

environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line and any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

we employ more than 70000 people worldwide approximately 15 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and works councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works council other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor additionally a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products 

  a material disruption of our operations particularly at our monitoring andor manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business 

if our operations particularly at our monitoring facilities andor manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to effectively respond to alarm signals fill customer orders and otherwise meet obligations to or demand from our customers which could adversely affect our financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to fill customer orders which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoffs of adt and tyco flow control 

although we believe that separating the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada and the flow control business by means of the spinoffs and combining the flow control business with pentairs business will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to tyco and its shareholders the spinoffs may not provide the results on the scope or on the scale we anticipate or could prove more costly than anticipated and the assumed benefits of the spinoffs and the merger may not be fully realized accordingly the spinoffs and the merger might not provide tyco and its shareholders benefits or value in excess of the benefits and value that might have been created or realized had tyco retained the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada andor the flow control business or undertaken another strategic alternative 

involving the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada andor the flow control business 

  we have entered into noncompete and nonsolicit agreements with adt that prohibit us from competing with adt in the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada for two years following the distributions 

the adt separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs includes noncompete provisions pursuant to which we are prohibited from competing with adt in the residential and small business security business in the united states and canada for two years from the date of the distributions in addition the adt separation and distribution agreement contains nonsolicitation provisions preventing us from soliciting adts residential and small business customers in the united states and canada for two years following the distributions this effectively prevents us from expanding our business into the residential and small business market in the affected markets and jurisdictions during the two years following the distributions 

  we recently rebranded our north american commercial security business to tyco integrated security and no longer own the right to use the adt® brand name in the united states and canada 

prior to the spinoffs we rebranded our north american commercial security business to tyco integrated security there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve name recognition or status under our new brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed the failure of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers resulting in reduced revenues in addition as a result of the spinoffs we own the adt® brand name in jurisdictions outside of the united states and canada and adt owns the brand name in the united states and canada although we have entered agreements with adt designed to protect the value of the adt® brand we cannot assure you that actions taken by adt will not negatively impact the value of the brand outside of the united states and canada these factors expose us to the risk that the adt® brand name could suffer reputational damage or devaluation for reasons outside of our control including adts business conduct in the united states and canada any of these factors may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

  we are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the normal course of our business we are subject to claims and lawsuits including from time to time claims for damages related to product liability and warranties litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights litigation alleging anticompetitive behavior and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages furthermore we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage if any of our products prove to be defective we may also be required to recall or redesign such products which could result in significant unexpected costs any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred 

the defense of these lawsuits may involve significant expense and diversion of our managements attention in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies or suffer from adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  our businesses operate in a regulated industry 

our operations and employees are subject to various us federal state and local licensing laws fire and security codes and standards and other laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business the loss of such licenses or the imposition of conditions to the granting or retention of such licenses could have an adverse effect on us furthermore our systems generally must meet fire and building codes in order to be installed and it is possible that our current or future products will fail to meet such codes which could require us to make costly modifications to our products or to forgo marketing in certain jurisdictions 

changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses if laws and regulations were to change or if we or our products failed to comply our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  our international operations are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 

due to the international scope of our operations the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes regulations issued by the us customs and border protection the us department of commerces bureau of industry and security the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control and various non us governmental agencies including applicable export controls customs currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations as applicable no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with or be able to detect violations of any such laws or regulations in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws outside the united states 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the us securities and exchange commission sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition 

furthermore we recently settled charges related to alleged fcpa violations with the doj and sec and agreed to pay approximately 26 million in fines disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the doj and sec in connection with the settlement we entered into a consent with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj and a subsidiary of ours which is no longer part of tyco as a result of the 2012 separation pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the fcpa pursuant to the nonprosecution agreement we have acknowledged that a number of our subsidiaries made payments both directly and indirectly to government officials in order to obtain and retain business with private and stateowned entities and falsely described the payments in the subsidiaries books records and accounts the nonprosecution agreement also acknowledges tycos timely voluntary and complete disclosure to the doj and our cooperation with the dojs investigation—including a global internal investigation concerning bribery and related misconduct—and extensive remediation under the nonprosecution agreement we have also agreed to cooperate with and report periodically to the doj concerning our compliance efforts and to continue to implement an enhanced compliance program and internal controls designed to prevent and detect fcpa violations notwithstanding our settlement of the doj and sec investigations we may be subject to allegations of fcpa violations in the future and we may be subject to commercial impacts such as lost revenue from customers who decline to do business with us as a result of our entry into the nonprosecution agreement or otherwise as a result of these compliance matters if so or if we are unable to comply with the provisions of the nonprosecution agreement we may be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the doj or sec in such a case we could be subject to material fines injunctions on future conduct the imposition of a compliance monitor or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and international trade laws when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor foreign laws such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and our business prospects 

  we are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install these claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability 

we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in addition if any of our products prove to be defective we may be required to recall or redesign such products which could result in significant unexpected costs any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances we cannot provide assurance however that these limitations will be 

enforced losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts the companys historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future in addition we continue to assess our strategy for resolving asbestos claims due to the number of claims and limited amount of assets at one of the companys nonoperating subsidiaries the company is pursuing alternatives for this subsidiary including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all current and future asbestos claimants against such subsidiary while the company has not finalized its approach if the company is ultimately successful with this alternative it will likely assign rights to certain insurance assets and make a cash payment in order to fully resolve the claims against the subsidiary unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we currently record an estimated liability related to pending claims and claims estimated to be received over the next fifteen years including related defense costs based on a number of key assumptions and estimation methodologies these assumptions are derived from claims experience over the past three years and reflect our expectations about future claim activities over the next fifteen years these assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate and accordingly we may incur additional liabilities in the future a change in one or more of the inputs or the methodology that we use to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims although it is possible that the company will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond the next fifteen years we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time on a quarterly and annual basis we perform analyses to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions 

we also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities there are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestosrelated recoveries such as policy triggers policy or contract interpretation success in litigation in certain cases the methodology for allocating claims to policies and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties the assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate and as a result actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables and cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs due to these uncertainties as well as our inability to reasonably estimate any additional asbestos liability for claims that may be filed beyond the next fifteen years it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the cost nor potential recoveries of resolving the pending and all unasserted asbestos claims additionally we believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond the next fifteen years net of expected recoveries could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous us federal state local and nonus environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites and • the health and safety of our employees we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have received notification from the united states environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at several sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties these projects relate primarily to a variety of activities including 

• solvent oil metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and • structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement these projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us 

the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware 

  we depend on thirdparty licenses for our products and services 

we rely on certain software technology that we license from third parties and use in our products and services to perform key functions and provide critical functionality particularly in our commercial security business because our products and services incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties we are to a certain extent dependent upon such third parties ability to maintain or 

enhance their current products and services to ensure that their products are free of defects or security vulnerabilities to develop new products and services on a timely and costeffective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes further these thirdparty technology licenses may not always be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all if our agreements with thirdparty vendors are not renewed or the thirdparty software fails to address the needs of our software products and services we would be required to find alternative software products and services or technologies of equal performance or functionality we cannot assure that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by thirdparty software if we lose the license to this software it becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products and services or is otherwise not adequately maintained or updated furthermore even if we obtain licenses to alternative software products or services that provide the functionality we need we may be required to replace hardware installed at our monitoring centers and at our customers sites including security system control panels and peripherals in order to effect our integration of or migration to alternative software products any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  infringement or expiration of our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets knowhow confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights we cannot guarantee however that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology trade secrets or knowhow for example effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate in addition while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets knowhow business strategy and other proprietary information such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow related to the design manufacture or operation of our products if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail further adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise finally for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection once a patent has expired the product is generally open to competition products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position intellectual property lawsuits or claims may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  legislative action by the us congress could adversely affect us 

legislative action could be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties or modify statutes or regulations upon which we rely which could materially adversely affect our effective corporate tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in switzerland or limiting our ability as a swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between switzerland and the united states we could be subject to increased taxation 

  police departments could refuse to respond to calls from monitored security service companies 

police departments in a limited number of us cities do not respond to calls from monitored security service companies either as a matter of policy or by local ordinance we have offered affected customers the option of receiving responses from private guard companies in most cases through contracts with us which increases the overall cost to customers if more police departments whether inside or outside the us were to refuse to respond or be prohibited from responding to calls from monitored security service companies our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively impacted and our results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 

risks related to our liquidity and financial markets 

  disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us our customers and our suppliers by increasing our funding costs or reducing the availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of common shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets in 2009 and 2010 credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects based on these conditions our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit agreements contain customary financial covenants including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt in addition the indentures governing our bonds contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions 

although we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 

  material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

we estimate that our available cash our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the 

foreseeable future however material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar contingencies could require additional funding if such developments require us to obtain additional funding we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

such an outcome could have important consequences to you for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development efforts and other corporate purposes including dividend payments • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions • limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate • restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities • make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness and • increase the difficulty andor cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness   we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial health and may decrease our profitability 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or if our cash requirements are more than we expect we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital stock the terms of the debt or capital stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity your percentage ownership in us would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed it could affect our financial health which could negatively affect your investment in us 

risks relating to tax matters 

  examinations and audits by tax authorities including the irs could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 separation we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments although we expect to resolve a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments with the irs a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years as of the date hereof it is unlikely that we will be able to resolve these open items which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany transactions during the period related to the audits through the irs appeals process as a result we may be required to litigate these matters the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected 

net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances we have assessed our obligations under the 2007 tax sharing agreement and determined that the recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by us under such agreement however such amount could differ materially from amounts that are actually determined to be due and any such difference could materially adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and te connectivitys income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including june 29 2007 

in connection with the 2007 separation tyco entered into a tax sharing agreement the 2007 tax sharing agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre2007 separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 separation more specifically tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 separation in addition in the event the 2007 separation or certain related transactions is determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 separation by tyco covidien or te connectivity the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on tyco covidien or te connectivity as a result thereof if none of the companies is responsible for such failure then tyco covidien and te connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 tax sharing agreement costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties 

if any party to the 2007 tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the 2007 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our covidiens and te connectivitys tax liabilities 

as noted above with respect to years prior to and including the 2007 separation tax authorities have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments that are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which may require tyco to make a payment to a taxing authority covidien or te connectivity tyco has recorded a liability as of september 28 2012 which it has assessed and believes is adequate to cover the payments that tyco may be required to make under the 2007 tax sharing agreement however the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in tyco being responsible for a greater amount than it expects under the 2007 tax sharing agreement 

  we share responsibility for certain of our pentairs and adts income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with the distributions we entered into the 2012 tax sharing agreement with pentair and adt that is separate from the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which govern the rights and obligations of tyco adt and pentair for certain tax liabilities before the distributions including tycos obligations under the 2007 tax sharing agreement under the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco pentair and adt share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to adts us tyco flow controls and tycos income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement excluding approximately 175 million of pre2012 separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be 

paid prior to the 2012 separation collectively shared tax liabilities tyco will be responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities pentair and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities tyco pentair and adt will share 525 20 and 275 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 275 and 525 by pentair adt and tyco respectively as of september 28 2012 tyco established liabilities representing the fair market value of its obligations under the 2012 tax sharing arrangement which is recorded in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet with an offset to tyco shareholders equity in addition we entered into a nonincome tax sharing agreement with adt in connection with the adt distribution to the extent we are responsible for any liability under these agreements there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that if any party were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of certain taxes that may arise as a result of the failure of the distributions to be tax free such taxes as defined in the 2012 tax sharing agreement distribution taxes each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our pentairs and adts tax liabilities 

  if the distributions or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor both adt and pentair could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco has received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distributions to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distributions will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 andor 361 of the code except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of adt common stock or of pentair common shares the private letter ruling also provides that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions will qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter ruling tyco has received an opinion from the law firm of mcdermott will  emery llp confirming the taxfree status of the distributions for us federal income tax purposes the private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us pentair and adt regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters 

notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distributions or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distributions or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership which might take into account changes in pentair stock ownership resulting from the merger or asset ownership after the distributions an opinion of counsel represents counsels best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinions will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distributions ultimately are determined to be taxable the distributions could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to you for us federal income tax purposes and you could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the pentair common shares and the shares of adt common stock distributed to our shareholders on the distribution date over our tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally 

would not be subject to us federal income tax however we pentair or adt could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distributions or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distributions by us pentair or adt the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us pentair or adt as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distributions by us pentair or adt then we pentair and adt will share the liability in the manner and according to the sharing percentages set forth in the 2012 tax sharing agreement such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

  if the distributions or the merger are determined to be taxable for swiss withholding tax purposes we adt and pentair could incur significant swiss withholding tax liabilities 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to tycos shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder as of january 1 2011 distributions to shareholders out of qualifying contributed surplus accumulated on or after january 1 1997 are exempt from swiss withholding tax if certain conditions are met  kapitaleinlageprinzip  tyco has obtained a ruling from the swiss federal tax administration confirming that the distributions qualify as payment out of such qualifying contributed surplus and no amount will be withheld by tyco when making the distributions 

we have obtained tax rulings from the swiss tax administrations confirming that the merger is a transaction that is generally taxfree for swiss federal cantonal and communal tax purposes including with respect to swiss stamp tax and swiss withholding tax however these tax rulings rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco notwithstanding these tax rulings the swiss federal tax administration could determine on audit that the distributions or the merger should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax or other tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated if the distributions or the merger ultimately are determined to be taxable for withholding tax or other tax purposes tyco and tyco shareholders could incur material swiss withholding tax liabilities that could significantly detract from or eliminate the benefits of the distributions and the merger in addition tyco could become liable to indemnify pentair for part of any swiss withholding tax liabilities to the extent provided under the 2012 tax sharing agreement 

  we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the distributions because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the distributions in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distributions even if the distributions otherwise qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporatelevel gain to tyco and certain of its affiliates under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares pentairs shares or adts shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distributions any acquisitions or issuances of our shares pentairs shares or adts shares within two years after the distributions generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan although we pentair or adt may be able to rebut that presumption 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to us of the distributions under the 2012 tax sharing agreement that we entered with pentair and adt we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distributions and related transactions from being taxfree further for the 

twoyear period following the distributions without obtaining the consent of pentair and adt a private letter ruling from the irs or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm we may be prohibited from 

• approving or allowing any transaction that results in a change in ownership of more than 35 of our common shares when combined with any other changes in ownership of our common shares • redeeming equity securities • selling or otherwise disposing of more than 35 of our assets or • engaging in certain internal transactions these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business moreover the 2012 tax sharing agreement also provides that we will be responsible for any taxes imposed on pentair or any of its affiliates or on adt or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distributions or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distributions by or in respect of us any of our affiliates or our shareholders 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in switzerland 

  swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of tycos securities 

because of differences between swiss law and us state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of swiss companies and those incorporated in the us it may not be possible to enforce in switzerland court judgments obtained in the united states against tyco based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states as a result in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws us investors may find it difficult to 

• effect service within the united states upon tyco or its directors and officers located outside the united states • enforce judgments obtained against those persons in us courts or in courts in jurisdictions outside the united states and • enforce against those persons in switzerland whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of us courts civil liabilities based solely upon the us federal or state securities laws original actions against persons in switzerland based solely upon the us federal or state securities laws are governed among other things by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on international private law this statute provides that the application of provisions of nonswiss law by the courts in switzerland shall be precluded if the result was incompatible with swiss public policy also mandatory provisions of swiss law may be applicable regardless of any other law that would otherwise apply 

switzerland and the united states do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the united states in switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a nonswiss court may be enforced in switzerland only if 

• the foreign court had jurisdiction pursuant to the swiss federal act on private international law • the judgment of such foreign court has become final and nonappealable • the judgment does not contravene swiss public policy 30 

• the court procedures and the service of documents leading to the judgment were in accordance with the due process of law and • no proceeding involving the same position and the same subject matter was first brought in switzerland or adjudicated in switzerland or that it was earlier adjudicated in a third state and this decision is recognizable in switzerland   our status as a swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax or at all 

swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years our current authorized share capital will expire on march 9 2013 additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions in the event we need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares currently chf 670 or approximately 714 based on the exchange rate in effect on october 1 2012 we will need to obtain approval of shareholders to decrease the par value of our shares as of october 1 2012 the closing price of our ordinary shares on the nyse was 2850 we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval in a timely manner obtaining shareholder approval would require filing a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convening a meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example dividends must be approved by shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

under swiss law a swiss corporation may pay dividends only if the corporation has sufficient distributable profits from previous fiscal years or if the corporation has distributable reserves each as evidenced by its audited statutory balance sheet distributable reserves are generally booked either as free reserves or as contributed surplus contributions received from shareholders in the reserve from capital contributions furthermore generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to our shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder unless the distribution is made to shareholders i by way of a reduction of par value or ii assuming certain conditions are met out of qualifying contributed surplus kapitaleinlage accumulated on or after january 1 1997 payments may be made out of registered share capital—the aggregate par value of a companys registered shares—only by way of a capital reduction tycos freely distributable reserves based on its swiss statutory account for fiscal year 2012 are chf 20 billion and its registered share capital is approximately chf 33 billion tycos freely distributable reserves will be reduced by any additional distributions approved by our shareholders including any ordinary cash dividends approved by our shareholders at the annual general meeting in march 2013 

if we are not successful in our efforts to make dividends through a reduction of par value or out of qualifying contributed surplus then any dividends paid by us generally will be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income which we refer to as the usswiss treaty may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds even if we are able to pay dividends in the future 

there can be no assurance that we will meet the requirements to pay such dividends free from swiss withholding tax or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future we cannot provide assurance that the current swiss law with respect to distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus will not be changed or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions there are currently motions pending in the swiss parliament that purport to limit the distribution of qualifying contributed surplus in addition over the long term the amount of par value available to us for par value reductions and the amount of qualifying contributed surplus available to us to pay out as distributions is limited 

under present swiss tax laws repurchases of shares for the purposes of cancellation are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the repurchase price and the par value except since january 1 2011 to the extent attributable to qualifying contributed surplus  kapitaleinlagereserven  if any if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves the swiss withholding becomes due no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares however should such treasury shares remain in treasury for six years the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period

environmental matters 

tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 28 2012 tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 48 million to 60 million as of september 28 2012 tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 50 million of which 43 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 7 million is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet in view of the companys financial position and reserves for environmental matters the company believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while the company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts the companys historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed the company cannot predict the extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future in addition the company continues to assess its strategy for resolving asbestos claims due to the number of claims and limited amount of assets at one of the companys nonoperating subsidiaries the company is pursuing alternatives for this subsidiary including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all current and future asbestos claimants against such subsidiary while the company has not finalized its approach if 

the company is ultimately successful with this alternative it will likely assign rights to certain insurance assets and make a cash payment in order to fully resolve the claims against the subsidiary 

as of september 28 2012 the company has determined that there were approximately 4900 claims pending against it its subsidiaries or entities for which the company has assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures this amount reflects the companys current estimate of the number of viable claims made against such entities and includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identify incorrect defendants are duplicative of other actions or for which the company is indemnified

income tax matters 

tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to years preceding the 2007 separation the issues and proposed adjustments related to such years are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 tax sharing agreement pursuant to which tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns the costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties tyco is reviewing and contesting certain tax adjustments proposed by tax authorities with respect to adjustments raised by the irs although the company has resolved a substantial number of these adjustments a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years as of the date hereof it is unlikely that tyco will be able to resolve all the open items which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions during the period through the irs appeals process as a result tyco expects to litigate these matters once it receives the requisite statutory notices from the irs which is expected to occur during fiscal 2013 the company has assessed its obligations under the 2007 tax sharing agreement and determined that its recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by the company under such agreement however the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material adverse impact to the companys financial position results of operations cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods

dividend policy 

prior to may 2011 the company paid dividends in the form of a return of share capital from the companys registered share capital these payments were made free of swiss withholdings taxes the company now makes dividend payments from its contributed surplus equity position these payments are also made free of swiss withholding taxes unlike payments made in the form of a reduction to registered share capital which are required to be denominated in swiss francs and converted to us dollars at the time of payment payments from the contributed surplus account may effectively be denominated in us dollars under swiss law the authority to declare dividends is vested in the companys general meeting of shareholders 

we expect to obtain shareholder approval of the annual dividend amount out of contributed surplus each year at our annual general meeting and we expect to distribute the approved dividend amount in four quarterly installments on dates determined by our board of directors the timing declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will depend upon many factors including our financial condition and results of operations the capital requirements of our businesses industry practice and any other relevant factors future dividends will be proposed by our board of directors and will require shareholder approval

recent transactions 

as a result of the 2012 separation we incurred and expect to continue to incur separation related costs including debt refinancing tax restructuring professional services restructuring and impairment charges and employeerelated costs during 2012 the company incurred pretax costs related to the 2012 separation of 561 million recorded within continuing operations and 278 million within discontinued operations costs incurred within continuing operations in fiscal 2012 include a charge of 453 million due to the early extinguishment of debt as the company refinanced its longterm debt as a result of the 2012 separation during fiscal 2012 the company paid 186 million in separation costs 18 million of which is included within continuing operations see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we determined that certain aged receivables in our row installation  services segment related to security contracts in china may not be collectible after a formal investigation we determined that certain records relating to those receivables were falsified by district level employees located in one region of china we have concluded that the revenue recognition practices related to the aged receivables which dated back to fiscal 2008 were inappropriate we have evaluated and concluded that the identified amounts were not material to any of our previously issued annual and interim financial statements including the effects of presenting adt and tyco flow control as discontinued operations although management has determined the amounts individually and in the aggregate are not material to prior periods in accordance with authoritative accounting literature on considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year the financial statements included herein have been adjusted to correct for the impact of these items 

as a result we have revised our previously reported operating results to reflect certain immaterial adjustments primarily related to revenue recognition and cost of goods sold these adjustments reduced previously reported net revenue by approximately 49 million and 37 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively and reduced previously reported operating income by approximately 14 million and 2 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements additionally we reversed approximately 31 million of net revenue and reduced operating 

income by 17 million during fiscal 2012 of which less than 1 million and 7 million of net revenue and operating income respectively were recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012

fiscal 2011 

net revenue for the year ended september 30 2011 decreased by 463 million or 42 to 106 billion as compared to net revenue of 110 billion for the year ended september 24 2010 on an organic basis net revenue grew by 465 million or 48 year over year primarily driven by our global products and na installation  services segments net revenue was unfavorably impacted by the net 

impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 13 billion or 118 which was primarily the result of the sale of a majority interest in the companys former electrical and metal products business which contributed approximately 14 billion of net revenue during the year ended september 24 2010 and 347 million during the year ended september 30 2011 net revenue was also unfavorably impacted by 72 million or 07 due to the deconsolidation of a joint venture in our row installation  services segment due to the adoption of an accounting standard favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net revenue by 306 million or 28 in addition because the companys fiscal year ends on the last friday in september fiscal 2011 consisted of 53 weeks as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2010 as a result fiscal year 2011 includes an estimated 98 million or 09 of revenue from the additional week

operating income for the year ended september 28 2012 decreased 297 million or 302 to 685 million as compared to operating income of 982 million for the year ended september 30 2011 operating income for the year ended september 28 2012 declined primarily due to the net gain on divestitures of 224 million that was recognized in the prior year primarily related to a 248 million net gain related to the sale of a majority interest in the companys former electrical and metal products business operating income for the year ended september 30 2011 increased 367 million or 597 to 982 million as compared to operating income of 615 million for the year ended september 24 2010 operating income for the year ended september 30 2011 improved due to the net gain on divestitures pricing initiatives improvement in mix driven by project selectivity as well as the benefit of ongoing cost containment and restructuring actions items impacting operating income for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows 



1 includes a 248 million net gain on the divestiture of a majority interest in the electrical and metal products business 

interest income and expense 

interest income was 19 million in 2012 as compared to 27 million and 25 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively interest income decreased in 2012 primarily due to decreased investment yields compared to 2011 and 2010 

interest expense was 209 million in 2012 as compared to 240 million and 279 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the weightedaverage interest rate on total debt outstanding as of september 28 2012 september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 was 65 59 and 63 respectively these decreases in interest expense and fluctuations in the weightedaverage interest rate are primarily related to savings realized from the 26 billion debt redemptions in 2012 and from the replacement of higher coupon notes with lower coupon notes during 2011 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

other expense net 

significant components of other expense net for 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows  in millions 



effective income tax rate 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended september 28 2012 was not meaningful primarily as a result of separation related charges which were incurred for which no tax benefit was recognized as well as a valuation allowance of 235 million recorded due to net operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize in future periods additionally our effective income tax rate for the year ended september 28 2012 was impacted by enacted tax law changes favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions and a nonrecurring item generating a tax benefit 

our effective income tax rate was 175 and a benefit of 60 during the years ended september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 respectively the increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily related to the tax charge recorded in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in our electrical and metal products business during the first quarter of 2011 a nonrecurring transaction generating a tax benefit in 2010 and a release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2010 the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions during 2011 the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1826 million and 1149 million as of september 28 2012 and september 30 2011 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions specifically the valuation allowance includes separation related charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt which further increased a net operating loss carryforward in 2012 which we do not expect to realize in future periods the valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was morelikelythannot that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 

equity loss income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 

equity loss income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012 and 2011 reflects our share of atkore international group incs atkore net loss which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting equity loss income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries was nil in 2010

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

depreciation and amortization methods for security monitoringrelated assets —tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories internally generated residential subscriber systems outside of north america internally generated commercial subscriber systems collectively referred to as subscriber system assets and customer accounts acquired through the adt dealer program primarily outside of north america referred to as dealer intangibles subscriber system assets include installed property plant and equipment for which tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber in certain geographical areas where the company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time the company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition the company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years the accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 135 to 360 for commercial subscriber pools and dealer intangibles and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method the company uses a straightline method with a 14year life for nonpooled subscriber system assets primarily in europe latin america and asia and related deferred revenue with remaining balances written off upon customer termination 

revenue recognition —contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems large security intruder systems and other constructionrelated projects are recorded primarily under the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion the risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in longterm contracts provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable 

sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements including equipment installation monitoring services and maintenance agreements we assess our revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting when ownership of the system is transferred to the customer each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery installation and customer acceptance is completed while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe or tpe is available revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the noncontingent upfront consideration received at the time of installation since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services 

product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct indirect and other market participants rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis 

loss contingencies —accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables —we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials we estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs based on the companys historical claim experience and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed the companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates the company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time the lookback period over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made in the future during a defined period of time the lookforward period as part of the companys annual valuation process in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 the company utilized a lookback period of three years and a lookforward period of fifteen years except for claims made against a nonoperating subsidiary that the company is pursuing alternatives for including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all current and future asbestos claimants against such subsidiary 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters we record asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims in determining the amount of insurance recoverable we consider available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers 

annually we perform an analysis with the assistance of outside counsel and other experts to update estimated asbestosrelated assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

income taxes —in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is morelikelythannot the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be 

reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairments —goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur in performing these assessments management relies on and considers a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable market transactions to the extent available other market data and the companys overall market capitalization 

we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates discounted using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for market participants a market approach utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction to the extent available is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss in the second step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 

we recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows 

• a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate ie sales volumes and prices especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets • an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree • volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and • unexpected regulatory changes while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values if our assumptions are not realized it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded however it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 

longlived assets —asset groups held and used by the company including property plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairments to longlived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets the calculation of the fair value of longlived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of longlived assets there is a risk that the carrying value of our longlived assets may be overstated or understated 

pension and postretirement benefits —our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses for active plans such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately 77 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately 1 million we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class historical performance of asset classes over longterm periods asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the 

expected longterm return on plan assets a 25 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately 3 million

nonus gaap measure 

in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by us gaap we also disclose the nonus gaap measures of organic revenue growth decline we believe that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented when read in conjunction with our us gaap revenue it enables investors to better evaluate our operations without giving effect to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may be significant from period to period in addition organic revenue growth decline is a factor we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business this measure is not a financial measure under us gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue as determined in accordance with us gaap and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies organic revenue growth decline presented herein is defined as revenue growth decline excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations acquisitions and divestitures and other changes that may not reflect underlying results and trends for example the 53 rd week of operations in fiscal year 2011 our organic growth decline calculations incorporate an estimate of prior year reported net revenue associated with acquired entities that have been fully integrated within the first year and exclude prior year net revenue associated with entities that do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations which have been divested within the past year adjusted number we calculate the rate of organic growth decline based on the adjusted number to better reflect the rate of growth decline of the combined business in the case of acquisitions or the remaining business in the case of dispositions we base the rate of organic growth decline for acquired businesses that are not fully integrated within the first year upon unadjusted historical net revenue we may use organic revenue growth decline as a component of our compensation programs 

the table below details the components of organic revenue growth decline and reconciles the nonus gaap measure to us gaap net revenue growth decline

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of conducting business we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices accordingly we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject we seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may from time to time include forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency options interest rate swaps commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated nonfunctional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so 

we do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us we only enter into contracts with counterparties having strong investment grade longterm credit ratings from standard  poors and moodys these counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party 

foreign currency exposures 

we hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to operating entities through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts additionally for our corporate financing entities we manage the foreign currency exposure through a combination of multicurrency notional pool and forward contracts our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the british pound euro australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso against the us dollar the market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contract is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on september 28 2012 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 7 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 9 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 

prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we hedged net investments in certain foreign operations through the use of foreign currency exchange forward contracts the objective was to minimize the exposure to changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated net investment as of the quarter ended december 30 2011 we terminated our net investment hedge accordingly the aggregate notional amount of these hedges was nil and approximately 224 million as of september 28 2012 and september 30 2011 respectively 

as of september 28 2012 and september 30 2011 20 billion and 14 billion respectively of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature for the fiscal years ended september 28 2012 september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 we recorded 48 million of cumulative transaction gain and 2 million and 34 million of cumulative translation losses respectively through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans 

interest rate exposures 

we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting 

purposes since the third quarter of 2009 tifsa has been entering into interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixedrate debt to variable rates in these contracts tifsa agrees with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in connection with the debt tenders and redemption during the quarter ended september 28 2012 tifsa settled all outstanding interest rate swaps accordingly as of september 28 2012 and september 30 2011 the total gross notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts was nil and 12 billion respectively

applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment our research and development expense was 147 million in 2011 131 million in 2010 and 116 million in 2009 

raw and other purchased materials 

we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including gasoline materials are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world there have been no shortages in materials that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses we enter into longterm supply contracts using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions significant changes in certain raw material costs may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the united states in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries our tyco security solutions business currently relies extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals and wireline and wireless telephone companies in the united states are regulated by the federal and state governments another example is our tyco flow control business which is subject to strict regulations governing the import and export of goods and technologies across international borders particularly with respect to dual use products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our tyco fire protection business these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations both positively and negatively for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors—risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters and item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and the health and safety of our employees 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations 

given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 38 million to 86 million as of september 30 2011 as of september 30 2011 we concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 60 million of which 18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 42 million is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of september 30 2011 we employed approximately 102000 people worldwide of which approximately 39000 are employed in the united states and 63000 are outside the united states approximately 22000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as technological obsolescence labor relations geopolitical events climate change and international operations 

risks relating to our businesses 

  general economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of certain industries in which we operate for example demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial construction the amount of discretionary consumer and business spending and the performance of the housing market each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality economic weakness in some end markets has adversely affected certain of our businesses events or conditions that adversely impact the health of the us or global economies or in the industries in which we operate could have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  we face intense competition in each of our businesses and competitive challenges from lower cost manufacturers if we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

we operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service providers both domestically and on a global basis our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from alternative service providers around the world key components of our competitive position are our ability to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully this requires continuous management focus on reducing costs maintaining our competitive position and improving efficiency through cost controls productivity enhancements and regular appraisal of our asset portfolio if we are unable to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or costeffectiveness or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected 

  our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to successfully compete with new and existing competitors by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry standards and potential new entrants in our markets for example a number of cable and other telecommunications companies have introduced security services offerings including interactive security services that are competitive with the products and services offered through our tyco security solutions business if these services are aggressively marketed and gain market acceptance our ability to grow our tyco security solutions business in particular our pulse offering could be materially adversely affected accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets develop acquire and maintain competitive products and services enhance our products and services by adding innovative features that differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and develop or acquire manufacture and bring products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products and services based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis moreover as we introduce new products such as pulse we may be unable to detect and correct defects in the product or in its installation which could result in loss of sales or delays in market acceptance even after introduction new or enhanced products may not satisfy consumer preferences and product failures may cause consumers to reject our products as a result these 

products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand images could suffer in addition our competitors may introduce superior designs or business strategies impairing our brands and the desirability of our products and services which may cause consumers to defer or forego purchases of our products and services in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance the potential for product defects or the obsolescence of our products and services could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  our tyco security solutions business may experience higher rates of customer attrition which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers increasing our depreciation and amortization expense 

if customers in our tyco security solutions business segment are dissatisfied with our products or services and switch to competitive products or services or disconnect for other reasons our attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates tyco security solutions recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide tyco amortizes the costs of adts acquired contracts and related customer relationships based on the estimated life of the customer relationships internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated if attrition rates were to rise significantly we may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  we have significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

we generated 52 of our net revenue outside of the united states in 2011 we expect net revenue generated outside of the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenue business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of certain labor regulations outside of the united states • compliance with a wide variety of nonus laws and regulations • changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets • the threat of nationalization and expropriation • increased costs and risks of doing business in a wide variety of jurisdictions • changes in enacted tax laws • limitations on repatriation of earnings and • fluctuations in revenues operating margins and other financial measures due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 11 

changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition result of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our net revenue derived from sales in nonus markets for 2011 was 52 of our total net revenue and we expect revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net revenue therefore if the us dollar has strengthened in relation to the principle foreign currencies where we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease and viceversa changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances may have a significant effect on our results of operations our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our functional currency using yearend exchange rates for balance sheet data and average exchange rates for statement of operations data 

in addition we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method 

we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations these hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform as a result changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and other information noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information or a violation of the companys privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and in the normal course of our business we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers stockholders and employees the legal regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cybercriminals around the world a significant actual or potential theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of customer stockholder employee or our data by cybercrime or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines litigation or regulatory action against us in addition we depend on our information technology infrastructure for businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our 

operations increasingly our security products and services are accessed through the internet and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services via the internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services 

  if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  failure to retain or attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 

our culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training motivating and developing employees and in particular we strive to attract motivate and retain qualified managers to handle the daytoday operations of a highly diversified organization if we fail to retain and attract qualified personnel our operations could be adversely affected in addition excessive turnover in personnel could cause manufacturing inefficiencies in certain of our businesses the demand for experienced management in certain geographic areas also makes it difficult to retain qualified employees high turnover could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  we have recognized substantial impairment charges in the past and may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to periodically assess our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in material charges for goodwill and other asset impairments for example during the second fiscal quarter of 2009 we recognized aggregate goodwill and intangible asset impairments of 27 billion we maintain significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet and we believe that as of september 30 2011 these balances are recoverable however fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment analysis future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continually evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services 

products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line 

  we may acquire companies and make investments in order to complement existing businesses these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of management time and attention from daily operations • difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business • inability to obtain required regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms • potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us and • assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

risks related to the 2012 separation 

  the proposed spinoffs of our north american residential security business and our flow control business are contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions may require significant time and attention of our management may not achieve the intended results and may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us 

the proposed spinoffs of our north american residential security business and our flow control business are complex in nature subject to various conditions and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions we expect to file registration statements on form 10 with the sec that will contain detailed information regarding the businesses proposed to be spunoff completion of these spinoff transactions will be contingent upon a number of factors including the approval of our shareholders favorable rulings from tax authorities including the internal revenue service irs the effectiveness of each of the registration statements favorable capital market conditions and other conditions for these and other reasons the spinoff transactions may not be completed as expected by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2012 if at all additionally execution of the proposed spinoff transactions will require significant time and attention from management which may distract management from the operation of our businesses and the execution of our other initiatives our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the spinoff transactions further if the spinoff transactions are completed each of these transactions may not achieve the intended results and may result in costs that exceed managements estimated amount of 700 million any such 

difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  if the distributions or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoffs are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we or our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we will request a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes i the distributions of our north american residential security and flow control common shares to our shareholders except for cash if any received in lieu of fractional shares will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 andor 361 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and ii certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distributions will quality for favorable treatment under the code our receipt of the private letter ruling is critical to the completion of the spinoffs the private letter ruling will be based on certain facts assumptions representations and covenants provided by us regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters if any of the facts assumptions representations or covenants provided in connection with the private letter ruling is inaccurate or incomplete or is violated in any respect then we might not be able to rely on the ruling furthermore the irs will not rule on whether the spinoffs satisfy certain requirements necessary for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the private letter ruling will be based on representations provided by us that those requirements have been or will be satisfied and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling the 2012 separation will also be conditioned on our receipt of an opinion of outside counsel in form and substance satisfactory to us that confirms the taxfree status of the distributions the opinion will rely on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and certain facts assumptions representations and covenants provided by us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any respect could jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion the opinion will not be binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail 

if notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion the spinoffs are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes each us holder of our common stock who is subject to us federal income tax who receives shares of our north american residential security and flow control businesses would generally be treated as receiving taxable distributions of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received those distributions would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for each such stockholder any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholders tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain in addition internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoffs are ultimately determined to be taxable we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

the tax sharing agreement that we will enter into with the north american residential security and flow control businesses prior to the completion of the spinoffs will allocate for any taxes that arise if the spinoffs or certain internal transactions are determined to be taxable 

  if the 2012 separation is determined to be taxable for swiss withholding tax purposes we could incur significant swiss withholding tax liabilities 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to our shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder beginning on january 1 2011 distributions to shareholders out of contributed surplus accumulated on or after january 1 1997 are exempt from swiss withholding tax accordingly based on the swiss federal withholding tax act the distribution should not be subject to swiss federal withholding tax prior to the completion of the 

proposed spinoffs we intend to obtain tax rulings from the swiss federal tax administration confirming that the distributions will not be subject to swiss federal withholding tax these rulings will rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco regarding the past conduct of its businesses and other matters notwithstanding the tax rulings the swiss federal tax administration could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable for withholding tax purposes we and tyco could incur material swiss withholding tax liabilities that could significantly detract from or eliminate the benefits of the spinoff 

  if the 2012 separation is completed our operational and financial profile will change and we will be a smaller less diversified company 

if completed the 2012 separation will result in tyco being a smaller less diversified company focused on our commercial fire and security businesses which represents a narrower business focus than we currently have we will have a more limited business with greater concentration in the commercial market and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the diversification of revenues costs and cash flows will diminish as a result it is possible that our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and it may be difficult or more expensive for us to obtain financing our operations may also be impacted by a limited ability to attract new employees in a timely manner 

  if the 2012 separation is completed there may be substantial changes in our stockholder base which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate following the proposed spinoffs 

investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that is large and operates in multiple markets with a diversified product and services portfolio if the proposed spinoff transactions are completed shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a smaller company with its business concentrated in the commercial fire and security industry these changes may not match some holders investment strategies or meet minimum criteria for inclusion in stock market indices or portfolios which could cause investors to sell their shares of our common stock excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease following the completion of the proposed spinoff 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

  we are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to a significant number of claims and are named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits including claims for damages arising out of the use or installation of our products or services litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights litigation alleging anticompetitive behavior litigation related to environmental matters product liability litigation including asbestosrelated claims and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

  legislative action by the us congress could materially adversely affect us 

legislative action could be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties or regulations upon which we rely which would adversely affect our effective corporate tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in switzerland or limiting our ability as a swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between switzerland and the united states we could be subjected to increased taxation also various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that deny or would deny government contracts to us companies that move their locations abroad we cannot provide assurance that such legislation if enacted would not apply to us 

in addition there continues to be negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct substantial business in the us but are domiciled abroad we cannot provide assurance that we will not be subject to such criticism as a result of our domicile in switzerland 

  changes in legislation or governmental regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we operate in regulated industries our us operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal state and local governmental agencies with respect to safety of operations and equipment labor and employment matters and financial responsibility intrastate operations in the united states are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities and our international operations are regulated by the countries in which they operate and by extraterritorial laws we and our employees are subject to various us federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws and regulations including many related to consumer protection most states in which we operate have licensing laws covering the monitored security services industry and the construction industry our tyco security solutions segment relies heavily upon both wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals and these technologies are regulated by both the federal and state governments changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses if laws and regulations changed or we failed to comply our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws outside the united states 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental and commercial corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries furthermore we are subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments have been made by our subsidiaries and third party intermediaries in recent years in violation of the fcpa we have continued to report to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that we have taken in response to the allegations and our own 

internal investigations and in february 2010 we initiated discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters which remain ongoing although we have recorded our best estimate of potential loss related to these or other similar matters it is possible that this estimate may differ from the ultimate loss determined in connection with the resolution of this matter as we may be required to pay material fines consent to injunctions on future conduct consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are dual use products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and international trade laws when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor foreign laws such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and our business prospects 

  we continue to be responsible for a portion of our contingent and other corporate liabilities following the 2007 separation of our electronics and healthcare businesses primarily those relating to preseparation income tax liabilities 

under agreements entered in connection with the 2007 separation of our electronics te connectivity and healthcare covidien businesses we covidien and te connectivity have agreed to assume and be responsible for 27 42 and 31 respectively of certain of our contingent and other corporate liabilities subject to certain exceptions all costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties these contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to pre2007 separation income tax liabilities liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated companies are not allocated 

if any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment when due of any of these assumed obligations each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities including associated costs and expenses 

  we are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install these claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability 

we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in addition if any of our products prove to be defective we may be required to recall or redesign such products which could result in significant unexpected costs any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances we cannot provide assurance however that these limitations will be enforced losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  we are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against the company unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we record an estimated liability related to pending claims and claims estimated to be received over the next seven years including related defense costs based on a number of key assumptions and estimation methodologies these assumptions are derived from claims experience over the past five years and reflect our expectations about future claim activities over the next seven years these assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate and accordingly we may incur additional liabilities in the future a change in one or more of the inputs used to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims although it is possible that the company will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond the next seven years we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time we also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities there are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestosrelated recoveries such as policy triggers policy or contract interpretation success in litigation in certain cases the methodology for allocating claims to policies and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties the assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate and as a result actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables or cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs due to these uncertainties as well as our inability to reasonably estimate any additional asbestos liability for claims that may be filed beyond the next seven years it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the cost nor potential recoveries of resolving the pending and all unasserted asbestos claims additionally we believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond the next seven years net of expected recoveries could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and • the health and safety of our employees we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have received notification from the united states environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations these projects relate to a variety of activities including 

• solvent oil metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and • structure decontamination and demolition including asbestos abatement these projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us 

the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 38 million to 86 million as of september 30 2011 as of september 30 2011 we concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 60 million of which 18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 42 million is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware 

risks related to our liquidity 

  disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us our customers and our suppliers as access to liquidity may be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets leading to increased funding costs or unavailability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of common shares capital expenditures and investments in the companys subsidiaries although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets in 2009 and 2010 credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse affects based on these conditions our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions 

although we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

we estimate that our available cash our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future however material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar contingencies could require additional funding if such developments require us to obtain additional funding we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

such an outcome could have important consequences to you for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development efforts and other corporate purposes including dividend payments • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions • limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate • restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities • make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness and • increase the difficulty andor cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness risks relating to tax matters 

  we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and te connectivitys income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including june 29 2007 

under the tax sharing agreement entered in connections with the 2007 separation we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and te connectivitys income tax liabilities that result in cash payments based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 more specifically we covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 separation costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be shared equally among the parties we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition covidien and te connectivity are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in connection with the execution of the tax sharing agreement we established receivables from covidien and te connectivity representing the amount we expected to receive for preseparation uncertain tax positions we also established liabilities representing the fair market value of our share of their estimated obligations under the tax sharing agreement as of september 30 2011 we had recorded 73 million in other assets and 16 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets representing the receivables from covidien and te connectivity we had also recorded 387 million in other liabilities and 49 million in accrued and other current liabilities representing our estimated obligations to covidien and te connectivity under the tax sharing agreement 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our covidiens and te connectivitys tax liabilities 

  examinations and audits by tax authorities including the internal revenue service could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 separation we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments although we expect to resolve a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments with the irs a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years as of the date hereof it is unlikely that we will be able to resolve these open items which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany transactions during the period related to the audits through the irs appeals process as a result we may be required to litigate these matters the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances we have assessed our obligations under the tax sharing agreement and determined that the recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by us under such agreement however such amount could differ materially from amounts that are actually determined to be due and any such difference could materially adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  if the distribution of covidien and te connectivity common shares to our shareholders or certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the 2007 separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we have received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of covidien and te connectivity common shares to our shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution of such shares except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the code the private letter rulings relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco covidien and te connectivity regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable we would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the covidien and te connectivity common shares distributed to our shareholders on june 29 2007 over our tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately is determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the 2007 separation should be treated as taxable transactions 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in switzerland 

  swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of tycos securities 

because of differences between swiss law and us state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of swiss companies and those incorporated in the us it may not be possible to enforce in switzerland court judgments obtained in the united states against tyco based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states as a result in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws us investors may find it difficult to 

• effect service within the united states upon tyco or its directors and officers located outside the united states • enforce judgments obtained against those persons in us courts or in courts in jurisdictions outside the united states and • enforce against those persons in switzerland whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of us courts civil liabilities based solely upon the us federal or state securities laws switzerland and the united states do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the united states in switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a nonswiss court may be enforced in switzerland only if 

• the foreign court had jurisdiction pursuant to the swiss federal act on private international law • the judgment of such foreign court has become final and nonappealable • the judgment does not contravene swiss public policy • the court procedures and the service of documents leading to the judgment were in accordance with the due process of law and • no proceeding involving the same position and the same subject matter was first brought in switzerland or adjudicated in switzerland or that it was earlier adjudicated in a third state and this decision is recognizable in switzerland   as a result of our change of domicile from bermuda to switzerland and the increase in the par value of our shares we may have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

in connection with our change of domicile from bermuda to switzerland we significantly increased the par value of our shares currently the par value of our shares is chf 670 or approximately 744 based on the exchange rate in effect on november 7 2011 under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value as of november 7 2011 the closing price of our ordinary shares on the new york stock exchange nyse was 4647 in the event there is a need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our registered shares is below our par value we would need to obtain approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our registered shares we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval in a timely manner obtaining shareholder approval would require filing a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convening a meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans if we were to receive shareholder approval to reduce the par value of our registered shares the 

reduction would decrease our ability to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital which may subject shareholders to swiss withholding tax

 item 3 legal proceedings 

during the fiscal quarter ended december 24 2010 certain contingencies related to the previously disclosed settlement of the stumpf v tyco international ltd class action lawsuit elapsed this matter which was subject to the liability sharing provisions of the separation and distribution agreement with covidien and te connectivity had previously received final court approval for its settlement as a result of the lapsing of time periods for certain class members to state a claim against the company the company adjusted its remaining reserve for this and other legacy securities matters and recognized a net gain of 7 million during the quarter ended december 24 2010 since june 2007 the company has resolved substantially all of the legacy claims related to securities fraud and similar matters with the exception of the claims related to former management and mr frank walsh jr a former director described below 

tyco is a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management among which are affirmative cases brought by tyco against mr dennis l kozlowski tycos former chief executive officer mr mark swartz its former chief financial officer and mr frank walsh jr a former director in connection with these affirmative actions mr kozlowski through counterclaims and mr swartz through demand letters are seeking an aggregate of approximately 138 million allegedly due in connection with their compensation and retention arrangements and under erisa 

with respect to mr kozlowski on december 1 2010 the us district court for the southern district of new york ruled in favor of several of the companys affirmative claims against him before trial while dismissing all of mr kozlowskis counterclaims for pay and benefits after 1995 with respect to mr swartz on march 3 2011 the same court granted the companys motion for summary judgment the court further ruled that issues related to damages will need to be resolved at trial no trial date has been set the company expects mr kozlowski and mr swartz to contest these decisions as a result the company has and will continue to maintain the reserve recorded in its consolidated balance sheet for the amounts allegedly due under their compensation and retention arrangements and under erisa until the appeals process is complete although the ultimate resolution of these matters could differ materially from these estimates the company does not believe such resolution would have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

tyco has also brought an action against mr walsh in connection with the damages suffered by tyco arising from mr walshs breach of his fiduciary duties to tyco in october 2010 the us district court for the southern district of new york denied tycos affirmative claims for recovery of damages against mr walsh tyco is pursuing an appeal this affirmative matter and the affirmative matters against messrs kozlowski and swartz are not subject to the liability sharing provisions of the separation and distribution agreement separately mr walsh is pursuing a new york state court claim against the company asserting his entitlement to indemnification this action is subject to the liability sharing provisions of the separation and distribution agreement 

environmental matters 

tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 30 2011 tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 38 million to 86 million as of september 30 2011 tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 60 million of which 18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 42 million is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet in view of the companys financial position and reserves for environmental matters the company believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while the company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts the companys strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed the company cannot predict the extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future as of september 30 2011 there were approximately 4500 lawsuits pending against the company its subsidiaries or entities for which the company has assumed responsibility each lawsuit typically includes several claims and the company has determined that there were approximately 5600 claims outstanding as of 

september 30 2011 which reflects the companys current estimate of the number of viable claims made against it its affiliates or entities for which it has assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures this amount includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identify incorrect defendants or are duplicative of other actions

income tax matters 

in connection with the 2007 spinoffs of covidien and te connectivity from tyco tyco entered into a tax sharing agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre2007 separation income tax liabilities more specifically tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus income tax returns costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties consistent with the sharing provisions of the tax sharing agreement tyco had a net receivable from covidien and te connectivity of 89 million and 114 million as of september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 respectively in addition as of september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 the company had recorded 387 million and 398 million respectively in other liabilities and 49 million and 156 million respectively in accrued and other current liabilities during 2011 the company made a net cash payment of 113 million to covidien and te connectivity related to the resolution of certain audit and preseparation tax matters 

tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments the company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate 

for a detailed discussion of contingencies related to tycos income taxes see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

compliance matters 

as previously reported in the companys periodic filings the company has received and responded to various allegations and other information that certain improper payments were made by the companys subsidiaries and agents in recent years for example two subsidiaries in the companys flow control business in italy have been charged along with numerous other parties in connection with the milan public prosecutors investigation into allegedly improper payments made to certain italian entities during the fourth quarter of 2011 the companys subsidiaries were acquitted of these charges the company reported to the doj and the sec the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to these and other allegations and its internal investigations in 2005 the company informed the doj and the sec that it retained outside counsel to perform a companywide baseline review of its policies controls and practices with respect to compliance with the fcpa and that it would continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies the company has and will continue to communicate with the doj and sec to provide updates on the baseline review and followup investigations including as appropriate briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper conduct identified by the company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities the baseline review which has been completed has revealed that some business practices may not comply with tyco and fcpa requirements and in february 2010 the company initiated discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters which remain ongoing although the company has recorded its best estimate of potential loss related to this matter it is 

possible that this estimate may differ from the ultimate loss determined in connection with the resolution of this matter as the company may be required to pay material fines consent to injunctions on future conduct consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

covidien and te connectivity agreed in connection with the 2007 separation to cooperate with the company in its responses regarding these matters any judgment required to be paid or settlement or other cost incurred by the company in connection with the fcpa investigation matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the separation and distribution agreement which assigned liabilities primarily related to the former healthcare and electronics businesses of the company to covidien and te connectivity respectively and provides that the company will retain liabilities primarily related to its continuing operations any liabilities not primarily related to a particular segment will be shared equally among the company covidien and te connectivity 

as previously disclosed in early 2007 certain former subsidiaries in the companys flow control business were charged prior to their divestiture by the german federal cartel office fco with engaging in anticompetitive practices in particular with regard to its hydrant valve street box and fittings business the company investigated this matter and determined that the conduct may have violated german competition law the company is cooperating with the fco in its ongoing investigation of this violation the company has recorded its best estimate of potential loss related to this matter however it is possible that this estimate may differ from the ultimate loss determined in connection with the resolution of this matter as the company may be required to pay material fines suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 the company has concluded that its best estimate of probable loss for these compliance matters is 34 million in the aggregate which the company recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended september 30 2011 due to the sharing provisions in the separation and distribution agreement the company has also recorded receivables from covidien and te connectivity related to these compliance matters in other current assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet as of september 30 2011 

erisa partial withdrawal liability assessment and demand 

on june 8 2007 simplexgrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the national automatic sprinkler industry pension fund the fund under title iv of erisa if the fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multiemployer pension plan such as the fund the employer is liable for withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested benefits the alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between grinnell fire protection systems simplexgrinnells predecessor and road sprinkler fitters local union no 669 

erisa requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability assessment from the plan a plans assessment of withdrawal liability generally may be challenged only in arbitration and erisa requires that quarterly payments must continue to be made during the pendency of the arbitration if the employer prevails in arbitration and any subsequent appeals its quarterly withdrawal liability payments are refunded with interest the funds total withdrawal liability assessment against simplexgrinnell is approximately 25 million the quarterly withdrawal liability payments are 11 million 187 million of which has been cumulatively paid through september 30 2011 while the ultimate outcome is uncertain simplexgrinnell believes that it has strong arguments that no withdrawal liability is owed to the fund 

and it plans to vigorously defend against the funds withdrawal liability assessment the matter is currently in arbitration the company has made no provision for this contingency and believes that its quarterly payments are recoverable 

broadview security contingency 

on may 14 2010 the company acquired broadview security which is a business that was formerly owned by the brinks company under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992 as amended the coal act the brinks company and its majorityowned subsidiaries at july 20 1992 including certain legal entities acquired in the broadview security acquisition are jointly and severally liable with certain of the brinks companys other current and former subsidiaries for health care coverage obligations provided for by the coal act a voluntary employees beneficiary associate veba trust has been established by the brinks company to pay for these liabilities although the trust may have insufficient funds to satisfy all future obligations at the time of its spinoff from the brinks company broadview security entered into an agreement in which the brinks company agreed to indemnify it for any and all liabilities and expenses related to the brinks companys former coal operations including any health care coverage obligations the brinks company has agreed that this indemnification survives the companys acquisition of broadview security the company has evaluated its potential liability under the coal act as a contingency in light of all known facts including the funding of the veba and indemnification provided by the brinks company the company has concluded that no accrual is necessary due to the existence of the indemnification and its belief that the brinks company and veba will be able to satisfy all future obligations under the coal act 

adt dealer litigation 

as previously reported in 2002 the secs division of enforcement conducted an investigation related to past accounting practices for dealer connect fees that adt had charged to its authorized dealers upon purchasing customer accounts the investigation related to accounting practices employed by the companys former management which were discontinued in 2003 although the company settled with the sec in 2006 a number of former dealers and related parties have filed lawsuits against the company in the united states and in other countries including a class action lawsuit filed in the district court of arapahoe county colorado alleging breach of contract and other claims related to adts decision to terminate certain authorized dealers in 2002 and 2003 in february 2010 the court granted a directed verdict in adts favor dismissing a number of the plaintiffs key claims upon appeal the colorado court of appeals affirmed the verdict in adts favor in october 2011 while it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the colorado lawsuit or other lawsuits stemming from dealer terminations the company does not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other matters 

in addition to the foregoing the company is subject to claims and suits including from time to time contractual disputes and product and general liability claims incidental to present and former operations acquisitions and dispositions with respect to many of these claims the company either selfinsures or maintains insurance through thirdparties with varying deductibles while the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty the company believes that the resolution of any such proceedings whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows beyond amounts recorded for such matters

dividend policy 

prior to may 2011 the company paid dividends in the form of a return of share capital from the companys registered share capital these payments were made free of swiss withholding taxes the company now makes dividend payments from its contributed surplus equity position in its swiss statutory accounts these payments are also made free of swiss withholding taxes unlike payments made in the form of a reduction to registered share capital which are required to be denominated in swiss francs and converted to us dollars at the time of payment payments from the contributed surplus account may effectively be denominated in us dollars under swiss law the authority to declare dividends is vested in the companys shareholders 

we expect to obtain shareholder approval of the annual dividend amount out of contributed surplus each year at our annual general meeting and we expect to distribute the approved dividend amount in four quarterly installments on dates determined by our board of directors the timing declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will depend upon many factors including our financial condition and results of operations the capital requirements of our businesses industry practice and any other relevant factors future dividends will be proposed by our board of directors and will require shareholder approval

product sales 

revenue from product sales increased by 164 million or 142 during the year ended september 30 2011 as compared to the year ended september 24 2010 changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted product revenue by 24 million or 21 the remaining increase in net revenue was driven by increased volumes due to improved endmarket demand and implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures 

revenue from product sales decreased by 50 million or 41 during the year ended september 24 2010 as compared to the year ended september 25 2009 product revenue was unfavorably impacted by the estimated impact of 32 million or 27 of divestitures this decrease was partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates which favorably impacted product revenue by 13 million or 11 the remaining decrease was due to weakness in endmarket demand 

service revenue 

service revenue consists of inspection maintenance monitoring and repair of fire detection suppression and other life safety systems service revenue increased by 73 million or 42 during the year ended september 30 2011 as compared to the year ended september 24 2010 changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by 56 million or 32 while the deconsolidation of a joint venture discussed above unfavorably impacted service revenue by 21 million or 12 the remaining increase in service revenue was as a result of managements continued focus on expanding our recurring service revenue across all regions 

service revenue increased by 63 million or 38 during the year ended september 24 2010 as compared to the year ended september 25 2009 changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by 61 million or 37 despite the favorable impact of foreign currency service revenue was flat due primarily to weakness in the european markets

1 certain operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful 

operating income of 534 million increased 74 million or 161 for the year ended september 30 2011 as compared to the year ended september 24 2010 changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by 15 million or 33 other factors that contributed to the net increase in operating income and operating margin were increased sales volume implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures in the products business project selectivity in the systems installation business and costcontainment initiatives these increases were partially offset by additional environmental remediation costs of 11 million net of recoveries related to an isolated site and a 5 million decrease to operating income related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture included in operating income for the prior year comparable period is a curtailment gain of 8 million which was recognized upon the freezing of certain defined benefit plans in the united kingdom included in operating income for the year ended september 30 2011 was 38 million of restructuring charges net as compared to 42 million of restructuring charges net for the year ended september 24 2010 included in operating income for the year ended september 30 2011 was 29 million of losses on divestitures as compared to 2 million of losses on divestitures for the year ended september 24 2010 

operating income increased 440 million during the year ended september 24 2010 as compared to the year ended september 25 2009 operating income during the year ended september 25 2009 was negatively affected by a goodwill impairment charge of 420 million recorded at the emea fire and life safety reporting units additionally operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment actions 14 million of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent a curtailment gain of approximately 8 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the united kingdom there were 42 million of restructuring charges net and a loss on divestiture of 2 million during the year ended september 24 2010 compared with 62 million of restructuring charges net and nil of divestiture charges incurred in 2009 additionally management estimates that 7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009 operating income in 2009 was also unfavorably affected by the decreased sales volume discussed above 

tyco flow control 

net revenue 

net revenue for tyco flow control for the years ended september 30 2011 september 24 2010 and september 25 2009 were as follows  in millions 



net revenue for tyco flow control of 36 billion increased by 266 million or 79 during the year ended september 30 2011 as compared to the year ended september 24 2010 the increase in revenue was primarily due to favorable impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 183 million or 54 in addition an estimated 45 million or 13 of revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011 net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 7 million or 02 the remaining increase was primarily due to continued strength in endmarket demand in our valves and controls and thermal controls businesses partially offset by weakness in our water and environmental systems business the decreased revenue in our water and environmental systems business was primarily due to the completion of a large desalinization project in australia that commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and was completed at the beginning of the second quarter fiscal 2011 

net revenue for tyco flow control of 34 billion decreased by 122 million or 35 during the year ended year ended september 24 2010 as compared to the year ended september 25 2009 net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 218 million or 62 as well as the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 10 million or 03 this was more than offset by decreased revenues due to reduced volume in the valves and controls business driven by decreased demand in end markets 

operating income and operating margin 

operating income and operating margin for tyco flow control for the years ended september 30 2011 september 24 2010 and september 25 2009 were as follows  in millions 



operating income of 413 million increased by 3 million or 07 in the year ended september 30 2011 as compared to the year ended september 24 2010 operating income was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 22 million or 54 the increase in operating income was primarily due to continued strength in the valves and controls and thermal controls businesses which was more than offset by weakness in our water and environmental systems business restructuring charges net were 11 million during the year ended september 30 2011 as compared to 25 million in the prior year the year ended september 30 2011 included a 6 million gain on divestiture compared to a 1 million gain on divestiture for the year ended september 24 2010 

operating income of 410 million decreased by 86 million or 173 during the year ended september 24 2010 as compared to the year ended september 25 2009 primarily due to decreased volume in our valves business and an expected loss related to completion of a longterm construction project of approximately 18 million these declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 31 million or 63 the decline in operating income was also partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions operating income was unfavorably impacted by 24 million of restructuring and divestiture charges net during both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 additionally management estimated that 5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during the year ended september 25 2009 

corporate and other 

corporate expense decreased 266 million or 576 to 196 million for the year ended september 30 2011 as compared to an expense of 462 million for the year ended september 24 2010 the decrease in corporate expense during the year ended september 30 2011 is related to a 253 million net gain on divestitures primarily related to the divestiture of our electrical and metal products business compared to a 4 million net loss on divestitures during the year ended september 24 2010 corporate expense was also favorably impacted by cost containment initiatives during the year ended september 30 2011 as well as a lower net asbestos charge of 11 million recorded in connection with the companys valuation of its asbestosrelated liabilities during the year ended september 30 2011 compared to a 52 million net asbestos charge recorded during the year ended september 24 2010 corporate also recorded a 20 million charge in relation to a legacy legal matter during the year ended september 30 2011 as compared to nil during the year ended september 24 2010 additionally net restructuring charges and acquisition charges for the year ended september 30 2011 were 12 million and 1 million respectively while the year ended september 24 2010 included restructuring charges and acquisition charges of 1 million and 3 million respectively the year ended september 30 2011 included 24 million of separation costs primarily related to 

professional fees and banking services see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

corporate expense decreased 108 million or 189 to 462 million for year ended september 24 2010 as compared to 570 million for the year ended september 25 2009 corporate expense during 2009 was negatively affected by approximately 125 million of charges related to legacy securities matters partially offset by a 16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former executive restructuring charges decreased to 1 million for the year ended september 24 2010 as compared to 10 million in the year ended september 25 2009 corporate expense was also favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring charges these decreases in corporate expenses were partially offset by a 52 million net asbestos charge recorded during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to a 37 million net asbestos charge in 2009 both of which were recorded in conjunction with the valuation of our asbestosrelated liabilities and insurance assets in addition 4 million of divestiture charges net and 3 million of acquisition costs were recorded during the year ended september 24 2010 as compared to 6 million of divestiture charges net and nil of acquisition costs for the year ended september 25 2009 

interest income and expense 

interest income was 34 million in 2011 as compared to 31 million and 44 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively interest income increased in 2011 primarily due to increased investment yields compared to 2010 while investment yields continue to be lower than those experienced in 2009 

interest expense was 244 million in 2011 as compared to 284 million and 301 million in 2010 and in 2009 respectively the weightedaverage interest rate on total debt outstanding as of september 30 2011 september 24 2010 september 25 2009 was 59 63 and 66 respectively the decreases in interest expense and weightedaverage interest rate are primarily related to savings realized from the replacement of higher coupon notes with lower coupon notes over the past year including the redemption of 6375 notes due 2011 and issuance of 3375 notes due 2015 during the third quarter of 2010 and the maturity of 675 notes due 2011 and issuances of the 375 notes due 2018 and 4625 notes due 2023 during the second quarter of 2011 

other expense net 

other expense net of 16 million in 2011 primarily relates to our share of atkores net loss of 9 million which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and a decrease in the receivables due from covidien and te connectivity under the tax sharing agreement of 7 million see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

other expense net of 75 million in 2010 primarily related to a charge of 87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the redemption of our 6375 public notes due 2011 7 notes due 2028 and 6875 notes due 2029 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements this loss was partially offset by an 8 million gain recorded as a result of an increase in the receivables due from covidien and te connectivity under the tax sharing agreement 

other expense net of 7 million in 2009 primarily related to a 14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from covidien and te connectivity under the tax sharing agreement which was partially offset by income of 5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk related to the swiss franc denominated dividends 

effective income tax rate 

our effective income tax rate was 172 and 109 during the years ended september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 respectively the increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily 

related to the tax charge recorded in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in our electrical and metal products business during the first quarter of 2011 a nonrecurring transaction generating a tax benefit in 2010 and a release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2010 the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions during 2011 the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws as well as recurring factors such as the geographic mix of income before taxes 

the effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by goodwill impairment charges of 26 billion for which almost no tax benefit was available additionally taxes for 2009 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of contingency reserves partially offset by enacted tax law changes and changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively impacted the nonus deferred tax assets 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1400 million and 1379 million as of september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions the valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when the company determined that it was morelikelythannot that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized the company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the companys consolidated balance sheets 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 

2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairments 

annually in the fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if triggering events occur we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets with its carrying amount 

we began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in our tyco security solutions and tyco fire protection segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at our electrical metal products segments although we considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009 the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009 along with downward revisions to forecasted results restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks caused us to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed reporting units within our tyco security solutions and tyco fire protection segments continued to be negatively impacted as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market additionally our electrical metal products reporting unit continued to be negatively impacted by a decline in sales volume due to the downturn in the nonresidential construction market we determined that these underlying events and circumstances constituted triggering events for six reporting units where such events would more likely than not reduce the fair value below their respective carrying amounts specifically we concluded that our emea security acvs and sensormatic retail solutions srs reporting units within the tyco security solutions segment the emea fire and life safety reporting units within the tyco fire protection segment and our electrical and metal products reporting unit 

within the electrical and metal products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values furthermore we determined that certain indefinitelived intangible assets required impairment testing based on the underlying events and circumstances described as well as the continued deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer end market of our tyco security solutions segments as a result of the triggering events we performed longlived asset goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of our trade names and franchise rights 

fair value of each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows including underlying revenue and operating income growth rates discounted using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital of market participants in determining fair value management relied on and considered a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections including the timing for an economic recovery cash flow forecasts market data and our overall market capitalization based on the factors described above actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting units products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty the estimates of future cash flows used in the second quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from our most recent test conducted during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008 furthermore the range of the weightedaverage cost of capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for our products and services the results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units we recorded an aggregate noncash impairment charge of 26 billion 26 billion aftertax during the second quarter of 2009 the noncash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended march 27 2009 

indefinitelived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights were tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method which include the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and terminal year growth rate assumptions and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows attributable to the underlying intangible assets also during the second quarter of 2009 our estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of our tyco security solutions segment sensormatic tradename as well as certain tyco security solutions segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in our tests during the fourth quarter of 2008 the results of the impairment test indicated that the tyco security solutions sensormatic tradename and tyco security solutions franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts as a result we recorded an aggregate noncash impairment charge of 64 million 40 million aftertax during the second quarter of 2009 the noncash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended march 27 2009 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

depreciation and amortization methods for security monitoringrelated assets —tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories internally generated residential subscriber systems internally generated commercial subscriber systems collectively referred to as subscriber system assets and customer accounts acquired through the adt dealer program referred to as dealer intangibles subscriber system assets include installed property 

plant and equipment for which tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber in certain geographical areas where the company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time the company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition the company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets primarily in north america and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years the accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160 to 265 for residential subscriber pools and 135 to 360 for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method the company uses a straightline method with a 14year life for nonpooled subscriber system assets primarily in europe and asia and related deferred revenue with remaining balances written off upon customer termination 

revenue recognition —contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems large security intruder systems and other constructionrelated projects are recorded primarily under the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion the risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in longterm contracts provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable 

sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements including equipment installation monitoring services and maintenance agreements we assess our revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting when ownership of the system is transferred to the customer each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery installation and customer acceptance is completed while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price if neither vsoe or tpe is available revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the noncontingent upfront consideration received at the time of installation since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services 

product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct indirect and other market participants rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis 

loss contingencies —accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables —we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials we estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs predominantly based on claim experience 

over the past five years and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed including related defense costs over the next seven years on an undiscounted basis due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated we use multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss we have concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable estimate as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters we record asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims in determining the amount of insurance recoverable we consider available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers 

annually we perform a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions used in the estimated asbestosrelated assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

income taxes —in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is morelikelythannot the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the affect of a tax rate or law change on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and 

other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairments —goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur in performing these assessments management relies on various factors including operating results business plans economic projections including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery anticipated future cash flows comparable market transactions to the extent available and other market data 

we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates discounted using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for market participants a market approach utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction to the extent available is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss in the second step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 

we recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 additionally we determined as part of the assessment that our water and environmental systems reporting unit within our flow control segment had limited recoverability of goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 69 as of september 30 2011 the water and environmental systems goodwill balance was 298 million while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values if our assumptions are not realized it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded however it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material the company will continue to monitor the recoverability of its goodwill 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the 

underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows 

• a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate ie sales volumes and prices especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets • an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree • volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and • unexpected regulatory changes while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values if our assumptions are not realized it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded however it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 

longlived assets —asset groups held and used by the company including property plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairments to longlived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets the calculation of the fair value of longlived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of longlived assets there is a risk that the carrying value of our longlived assets may be overstated or understated 

pension and postretirement benefits —our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses for active plans such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately 75 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately 2 million we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class historical performance of asset classes over longterm periods asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected longterm return on plan assets a 25 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately 4 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

a fundamental objective of the company is to have sufficient liquidity balance sheet strength and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the world the primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations in addition we maintain a commercial paper program have access to committed revolving credit facilities and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources we continue to balance our operating investing and financing uses of cash through investments and acquisitions in our core businesses dividends and share repurchases in addition we currently estimate that we will incur approximately 700 million in costs related to the 2012 separation we believe our cash position amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs in the foreseeable future

backlog increased 175 million or 18 to 97 billion as of september 30 2011 the net increase in backlog was primarily related to an increase in recurring revenueinforce in our tyco security solutions segment and increased bookings in our tyco flow control segment these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bookings in our tyco fire protection segment tyco security solutions backlog includes recurring revenueinforce and longterm deferred revenue for upfront fees paid by customers for tyco security solutions owned security systems revenueinforce represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business tyco security solutions backlog of 68 billion and 66 billion as of september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 respectively consists primarily of 49 billion and 48 billion of recurring revenueinforce as of september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 respectively and 11 billion of deferred revenue for both september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 tyco security solutions backlog increased 166 million or 25 the net increase was primarily due to an increase in revenueinforce partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates by 36 million or 05 tyco flow controls backlog increased by 262 million or 177 the net increase was primarily due to increased bookings for several large projects within our valves and controls and thermal controls businesses changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted tyco flow controls backlog by 7 million or 05 these increases were partially offset by a decline in bookings in our water and environmental systems business tyco fire protections backlog decreased by 165 million or 127 tyco fire protections backlog was unfavorably impacted by the deconsolidation of a joint venture as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in addition backlog decreased in emea as a result of project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects these decreases were partially offset by increases in our north american and global fire safety products businesses changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted tyco fire protections backlog by 17 million or 13

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of conducting business we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices accordingly we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject we seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may from time to time include forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency options interest rate swaps commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated nonfunctional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so 

we do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an aa3 longterm debt rating these counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party 

foreign currency exposures 

we hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts during 2011 our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the swiss franc british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar the market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on september 30 2011 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 32 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 39 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 

during the third quarter of 2010 tyco international finance sa tifsa the companys finance subsidiary entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge its euro denominated net investment the aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately 224 million and 255 million as of september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 respectively the potential impact from a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 19 million net increase in other comprehensive income conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 24 million net decrease in other comprehensive income 

as of september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 29 billion and 30 billion respectively of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 september 24 2010 and september 25 2009 we recorded 16 million of cumulative transaction gain 24 million of cumulative translation loss and nil respectively through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans 

interest rate exposures 

our longterm debt portfolio primarily consists of fixedrate instruments the company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes these interest rate swap transactions manage the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixedrate debt to variable rates during the second quarter of 2011 tifsa also entered into interest rate swaps contracts to hedge 155 million notional amount of the 4125 public notes due 2014 in these contracts tifsa agrees with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in connection with the maturity of the 675 public notes during the second quarter of 2011 tifsa settled the corresponding interest rate swaps as of september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 the total gross notional amount of the companys interest rate swap contracts was 12 billion and 15 billion respectively a 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of september 30 2011 would result in a 29 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of september 30 2011 would result in a 30 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts 

commodity exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may in limited circumstances enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures these exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program during 2011 and 2010 the company entered into commodity swaps for copper which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes these swaps did not have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the price of copper as of september 30 2011 would not have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

backlog 

see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information relating to our backlog 

intellectual property 

patents trademarks copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including trademarks patents and patent applications in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and misappropriation of our proprietary rights and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to electronic security systems fire protection products and systems including fire detection and fire suppression with chemical gas foam and water agents piping couplings fittings for fluid systems personal protective products and systems for fire and other hazards integrated systems for surveillance and control of public transportation and other public works structural and electrical tubing and conduit building structural members panels and related fixtures firerated and armored electrical cabling heat tracing and floor heating systems security wire and fencing and flow control products including valves actuators and controllers and airflow control and sensing products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks 

while we consider our patents to be valuable assets we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents 

research and development 

we are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment our research and development expense was 131 million in 2010 116 million in 2009 and 125 million in 2008 

raw and other purchased materials 

we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including gasoline materials are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world there have been no shortages in materials that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses we enter into longterm supply contracts using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions significant changes in certain raw material costs have had and may in the future have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins in particular the electrical and metal products segment is significantly affected by volatility in the price of steel and copper with operating margins generally contracting in a declining price environment and expanding when prices of these commodities are rising 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the united states in areas such as consumer protection government contracts international trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example most us states in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries our adt worldwide business currently relies extensively upon 

the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals and wireline and wireless telephone companies in the united states are regulated by the federal and state governments another example is our flow control business which is subject to strict regulations governing the import and export of goods and technologies across international borders particularly with respect to dual use products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our fire protection services business these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations both positively and negatively for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors—risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters and item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and the health and safety of our employees 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations 

given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 27 million to 85 million as of september 24 2010 we concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 34 million of which 18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 16 million is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of september 24 2010 we employed approximately 108000 people worldwide of which approximately 41000 are employed in the united states and 67000 are outside the united states approximately 29000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as technological obsolescence labor relations geopolitical events climate change and international operations 

risks relating to our businesses 

general economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of certain industries in which we operate for example demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial construction the amount of discretionary consumer and business spending and the performance of the housing market each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality recent economic weakness has adversely affected our businesses for example weakness in the north american and european nonresidential construction markets have adversely impacted the system installation and service portion of our adt worldwide business and weak global economic conditions have also adversely impacted our flow control business continued weakness in the us or global economies or in the industries in which we operate could have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we face intense competition in each of our businesses and competitive challenges from lower cost manufacturers if we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

we operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service providers both domestically and on a global basis our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from alternative service providers around the world key components of our competitive position are our ability to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully this requires continuous management focus on reducing costs maintaining our competitive position and improving efficiency through cost controls productivity enhancements and regular appraisal of our asset portfolio if we are unable to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or costeffectiveness or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to successfully compete with new and existing competitors by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry standards and potential new entrants in our markets for example a number of cable and other telecommunications companies have introduced interactive security services that are competitive with the products and services offered through our adt worldwide business although these competitive products and services are currently in the initial stages of development and test marketing if they were to be aggressively marketed and gained market acceptance our ability to grow our adt worldwide business could be materially adversely affected accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets develop acquire and maintain competitive products and services enhance our products and services by adding innovative features that differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and develop or acquire manufacture and bring products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products and services based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance or their obsolescence could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our adt business may experience higher rates of customer attrition which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers increasing our depreciation and amortization expense 

although attrition rates for customers in our adt worldwide business decreased over the prior year to an average of 128 for 2010 as compared to 133 for 2009 and 129 in 2008 attrition rates may increase in the future due to reasons such as customer dissatisfaction or competitive offerings in periods of increasing attrition rates adts recurring revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty tyco amortizes the costs of adts contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the adt dealer program based on the estimated life of the customer relationships internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated if attrition rates were to rise significantly 

tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we have significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

we generated 51 of our net revenue outside of the united states in 2010 we expect net revenue generated outside of the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenue business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of certain labor regulations outside of the united states • compliance with a wide variety of nonus laws and regulations • changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets • the threat of nationalization and expropriation • increased costs and risks of doing business in a wide variety of jurisdictions • changes in enacted tax laws • limitations on repatriation of earnings and • fluctuations in revenues operating margins and other financial measures due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition result of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our net revenue derived from sales in nonus markets for 2010 was 51 of our total net revenue and we expect revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net revenue therefore if the us dollar has strengthened in relation to the principle foreign currencies where we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease and viceversa changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances may have a significant effect on our results of operations our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our functional currency using yearend exchange rates for balance sheet data and average exchange rates for statement of operations data 

in addition we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in 

recent years increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method this is most pronounced in our electrical and metal products segment which we have agreed to sell a 51 interest where fluctuations in the price of copper and steel can negatively affect both revenue and operating margins 

we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations these hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform as a result changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines for example we recently announced that we have agreed to sell a 51 interest in our electrical and metal products business segment to an affiliate of clayton dubilier and rice llc for approximately 720 million the sale is expected to close in the first half of 2011 divestitures involve risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business in addition divestitures may result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing businesses these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of management time and attention from daily operations • difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business • inability to obtain required regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms • potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us and • assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from unrelated parties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

failure to retain or attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 

the companys culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training motivating and developing employees and in particular it strives to attract motivate and retain qualified managers to handle the daytoday operations of a highly diversified organization if we fail to retain and attract qualified personnel the companys operations could be adversely affected in addition excessive turnover in personnel could cause manufacturing inefficiencies in certain of our businesses the demand for experienced management in certain geographic areas also makes it difficult to retain qualified employees high turnover could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could adversely impact the companys operating results 

we have recognized substantial impairment charges in the past and may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to periodically assess our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments during the second fiscal quarter of 2009 we recognized aggregate goodwill and intangible asset impairments of 27 billion resulting primarily from a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market in certain of our businesses a decline in sales volume at our electrical and metal products segment and downward revisions to forecasted results restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks as a result the company recognized an aggregate goodwill impairment of 26 billion 26 billion aftertax at six of our reporting units and intangible asset impairments of 64 million 40 million aftertax the company believes that our goodwill balance as of september 24 2010 is recoverable however fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment analysis future impairment charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

we are subject to a variety of claims and litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to a significant number of claims and are named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits including claims for damages arising out of the use or installation of our products or services litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights litigation alleging anticompetitive behavior litigation related to environmental matters product liability litigation including asbestosrelated claims and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

legislative action by the us congress could materially adversely affect us 

legislative action could be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely which would adversely affect our effective corporate tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in switzerland or limiting our ability as a swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between switzerland and the united states we could be subjected to increased taxation also various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that deny or would deny government contracts to us companies that move their locations abroad we cannot assure you that such legislation if enacted would not apply to us 

in addition there continues to be negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct substantial business in the us but are domiciled abroad we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such criticism as a result of our domicile in switzerland 

changes in legislation or governmental regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we operate in regulated industries our us operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal state and local governmental agencies with respect to safety of operations and equipment labor and employment matters and financial responsibility intrastate operations in the united states are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities and our international operations are regulated by the countries in which they operate and by extraterritorial laws we and our employees are subject to various us federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws and regulations including many related to consumer protection most states in which we operate have licensing laws covering the monitored security services industry and the construction industry our adt worldwide segment relies heavily upon both wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals and these technologies are regulated by both the federal and state governments changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses if laws and regulations changed or we failed to comply our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws outside the united states 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in fcpa enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental and commercial corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents furthermore we are subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments have been made by our subsidiaries and agents in recent years in violation of the fcpa we have continued to report to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that we have taken in response to the allegations and our own internal investigations in 2005 we informed the doj and the sec that we had retained outside counsel to perform a companywide baseline review of our policies controls and practices with respect to the fcpa the baseline review which has been completed has revealed that some business practices may not comply with tyco and fcpa requirements in february 2010 we initiated discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters active discussions are ongoing however the timing for ultimately reaching resolution as well as the outcome of this matter remains uncertain in connection with the resolution of these matters it is possible that we will be required to pay material fines consent to injunctions on future conduct consent to the imposition of a compliance monitor or suffer other civil or criminal penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants or a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations cash flows business prospects or the market value of our stock 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are dual use products which are products that may have both civil and military applications and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and international trade laws when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor foreign laws such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and our business prospects 

we continue to be responsible for a portion of our contingent and other corporate liabilities following the separation primarily those relating to preseparation income tax liabilities 

under the separation and distribution agreement the tax sharing agreement and other agreements entered in connection with the separation subject to certain exceptions contained in the tax sharing agreement we covidien and tyco electronics have agreed to assume and be responsible for 27 42 and 31 respectively of certain of our contingent and other corporate liabilities all 

costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties these contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to preseparation income tax liabilities liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated companies are not allocated 

if any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment when due of any of these assumed obligations each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities including associated costs and expenses 

we are subject to product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or install including claims arising from exposure to asbestos these claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability 

we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in addition if any of our products prove to be defective we may be required to recall or redesign such products which could result in significant unexpected costs we have been named in a significant number of lawsuits alleging damages based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos through the past distribution of asbestoscontaining industrial products any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide exposes us to the risks that we may be held liable for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances we cannot assure you however that these limitations will be enforced losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and • the health and safety of our employees we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have received notification from the united states environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we 

reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations these projects relate to a variety of activities including 

• solvent metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and • oil spill equipment upgrades and replacement these projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us 

the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs of approximately 27 million to 85 million as of september 24 2010 as of september 24 2010 we concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 34 million of which 18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 16 million is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of september 24 2010 environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware 

risks related to our liquidity 

disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us our customers and our suppliers as access to liquidity may be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets leading to increased funding costs or unavailability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of common shares capital expenditures and investments in the companys subsidiaries although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets in 2009 and 2010 credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions and similar disruptions in the credit markets could make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slow down in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse affects based on these conditions our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions 

although we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

we estimate that our available cash our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our revolving lines of credit will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future however material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements arising from litigation and similar contingencies could require additional funding if such developments require us to obtain additional funding we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

such an outcome could have important consequences to you for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes including dividend payments • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions • limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate • restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities • make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness and • increase the difficulty andor cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness risks relating to tax matters 

we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and tyco electronics income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including june 29 2007 

under the tax sharing agreement we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and tyco electronics income tax liabilities that result in cash payments based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 more specifically we covidien and tyco electronics share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities 

to our covidiens and tyco electronics us and certain nonus income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will generally be shared equally among the parties we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition covidien and tyco electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in connection with the execution of the tax sharing agreement we established receivables from covidien and tyco electronics representing the amount we expected to receive for preseparation uncertain tax positions we also established liabilities representing the fair market value of our share of their estimated obligations under the tax sharing agreement as of september 24 2010 we had recorded 89 million in other assets and 25 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets representing the receivables from covidien and tyco electronics we had also recorded 398 million in other liabilities and 156 million in accrued and other current liabilities representing our estimated obligations to covidien and tyco electronics under the tax sharing agreement 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our covidiens and tyco electronics tax liabilities 

examinations and audits by tax authorities including the internal revenue service could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to tax years preceding the separation we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments although we expect to resolve a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments with the irs a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years as of the date hereof it is unlikely that we will be able to resolve these open items which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany transactions during the period through the irs appeals process as a result we may be required to litigate these matters the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances we have assessed our obligations under the tax sharing agreement and determined that the recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by us under such agreement however such amount could differ materially from amounts that are actually determined to be due and any such difference could materially adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

if the distribution of covidien and tyco electronics common shares to our shareholders or certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we have received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of covidien and tyco electronics common shares to our shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution of such shares except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the code the private letter rulings relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco covidien and tyco electronics regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable we would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the covidien and tyco electronics common shares distributed to our shareholders on june 29 2007 over our tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately is determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the separation should be treated as taxable transactions 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in switzerland 

swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of tycos securities 

because of differences between swiss law and us state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of swiss companies incorporated in the us it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against tyco international based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states in switzerland as a result in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws us investors may find it difficult to 

• effect service within the united states upon tyco or its directors and officers located outside the united states • enforce judgments obtained against those persons in us courts or in courts in jurisdictions outside the united states and • enforce against those persons in switzerland whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of us courts civil liabilities based solely upon the us federal or state securities laws switzerland and the united states do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the united states in switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a nonswiss court may be enforced in switzerland only if 

• the foreign court had jurisdiction pursuant to the swiss federal act on private international law • the judgment of such foreign court has become final and nonappealable • the judgment does not contravene swiss public policy 22 

• the court procedures and the service of documents leading to the judgment were in accordance with the due process of law and • no proceeding involving the same position and the same subject matter was first brought in switzerland or adjudicated in switzerland or that it was earlier adjudicated in a third state and this decision is recognizable in switzerland as a result of our change of domicile from bermuda to switzerland and the increase in the par value of our shares we may have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

in connection with our change of domicile from bermuda to switzerland we significantly increased the par value of our shares currently the par value of our shares is chf 716 or approximately 741 based on the exchange rate in effect on november 8 2010 under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value as of november 8 2010 the closing price of our ordinary shares on the nyse was 3911 in the event there is a need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our registered shares is below our par value we would need to obtain approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our registered shares we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval in a timely manner obtaining shareholder approval would require filing a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convening a meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans if we were to receive shareholder approval to reduce the par value of our registered shares the reduction would decrease our ability to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital which may subject you to swiss withholding tax

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously disclosed the company and certain of its officers and directors were subject to a number of lawsuits alleging violations of federal and state securities laws and related claims since june 2007 the company has resolved substantially all of these claims although a number of matters have not reached final resolution the most significant of these is the previously disclosed settlement for 79 million of the stumpf v tyco international ltd matter  a class action lawsuit arising from tycos july 2000 initial public offering of common stock of tycom ltd the settlement received final court approval on august 25 2010 from the united states district court for the district of new jersey although certain contingencies for the matter will remain outstanding until the end of calendar year 2010 the settlement is subject to the liability sharing provisions of the separation and distribution agreement with covidien and tyco electronics the company believes its remaining reserve related to legacy securities matters is sufficient to satisfy the final resolution of this matter 

tyco is also a party to several lawsuits involving disputes with former management among which are affirmative cases brought by tyco against mr dennis l kozlowski tycos former chief executive officer mr mark swartz its former chief financial officer and mr frank walsh jr a former director in connection with these affirmative actions messrs kozlowski and swartz are seeking an aggregate of approximately 128 million allegedly due in connection with their compensation and retention arrangements and under erisa and mr walsh has made claims alleging that tyco is required to indemnify him for his defense costs and settlement amounts paid by him in connection with securities lawsuits and arising from his role as a tyco director tyco intends to vigorously defend each of these actions in october 2010 the us district court for the southern district of new york denied tycos affirmative claims against mr walsh tyco intends to appeal this decision mr walshs claims for indemnification against tyco remain outstanding 

tyco has reserved its best estimate of probable loss for these matters and although their ultimate resolution could differ materially from these estimates it does not believe any such resolution would have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

environmental matters 

tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 24 2010 tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 27 million to 85 million as of september 24 2010 tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 34 million of which 18 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 16 million is included in other liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet in view of the companys financial position and reserves for environmental matters the company believes that any potential payments of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with 

asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while the company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts the companys strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed the company cannot predict the extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future of the lawsuits that have proceeded to trial since 2005 the company has won or settled all but one case with that one case returning an adverse jury verdict for approximately 77 million which included both compensatory and punitive damages the company recently settled the matter while its appeal was pending for significantly less than the amount awarded by the jury as of september 24 2010 there were approximately 3500 lawsuits pending against the company and its subsidiaries each lawsuit typically includes several claims and the company has determined that there were approximately 4700 claims outstanding as of september 24 2010 which amount reflects the companys current estimate of the number of active claims made against it or its affiliates and includes adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identify incorrect defendants or are duplicative of other actions 

for a detailed discussion of asbestosrelated matters see note 14 of the consolidated financial statements 

income tax matters 

the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to tax years preceding the separation we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments although we expect to resolve a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments with the irs a few significant items are expected to remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years as of the date hereof it is unlikely that we will be able to resolve these open items which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany transactions during the period through the irs appeals process as a result we may be required to litigate these matters the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances we have assessed our obligations under the tax sharing agreement and determined that the recorded liability is sufficient to cover the indemnifications made by us under such agreement however such amount could differ materially from amounts that are actually determined to be due and any such difference could materially adversely affect our financial position results of operations cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

for a detailed discussion of income tax matters and audits see note 6 of the consolidated financial statements 

compliance matters 

as previously reported in the companys periodic filings the company has received and responded to various allegations and other information that certain improper payments were made by the companys subsidiaries and agents in recent years for example two subsidiaries in the companys flow control business in italy have been charged along with numerous other parties in connection with the milan public prosecutors investigation into allegedly improper payments made to certain italian entities and the company has reported to german authorities potentially improper conduct

1 approximately 21 million shares held directly or indirectly in treasury were cancelled 2 the par value of common shares was increased from 080 to chf 853 through an approximate 1for9 reverse share split followed by the issuance of approximately eight fully paid up shares so that the same number of shares were outstanding before and after the change of domicile which reduced share premium and increased common shares and 3 the remaining amount of share premium was eliminated with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus 



1 the dividends declared in 2010 and the second through fourth quarters of 2009 are the us dollar equivalent of swiss francs converted at the us dollarswiss franc exchange rate shortly before the payment dates as a swiss company dividends paid by tyco are subject to shareholder approval shareholders approved annual dividends of chf 093 and chf 090 at the shareholder meetings held on march 12 2009 and march 11 2010 respectively at the time of approval the equivalent us dollar amount of these dividends were 080 and 084 respectively dividend policy 

pursuant to swiss law dividend payments made prior to january 1 2011 are subject to swiss withholding taxes unless made in the form of a return of capital from our registered share capital as a result we have paid dividends in the form of a reduction of registered share capital denominated in swiss francs since march 2009 notwithstanding the swiss denomination of annual dividends we have made payments of dividends in us dollars based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid increase or decrease the us dollar amount required to be paid we have managed the variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk our last dividend 

expected to be paid out of registered share capital is scheduled to be paid in february 2011 after this payment we expect to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction in contributed surplus which are also expected to be made free of swiss withholding taxes but can be denominated and paid in us dollars removing the exposure to currency fluctuations for recipients of the dividend we expect to obtain shareholder approval of the annual dividend amount out of contributed surplus each year at our annual general meeting and we expect to distribute the approved dividend amount in four quarterly installments the timing of which will be determined by our board of directors the timing declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will depend upon many factors including our financial condition and results of operations the capital requirements of our businesses industry practice and any other relevant factors future dividends will be proposed by our board of directors and as stated above require shareholder approval

overview 

net revenue for 2010 increased 134 million or 08 as compared to 2009 the increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 624 million or 37 this increase was partially offset by net revenue declines experienced in our flow control and fire protection services segments flow controls decline in net revenue was primarily the result of reduced volume in its valves business driven by decreased demand in our end markets weakness in the commercial end market resulted in a decline in product and systems installation revenue within our fire protection services segment 

service revenue continued to grow as a percentage of our overall revenue to 41 for 2010 as compared to 40 and 36 for 2009 and 2008 respectively our service revenues are principally derived from our adt worldwide and fire protection services businesses and represent a predictable and consistent source of revenue recurring revenue in our adt worldwide business represents approximately 58 of adts total revenue compared to approximately 54 in 2009 and 51 in 2008 recurring revenue represents revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contractual arrangements in the fire protection services business service revenue continued to increase as a percentage of fire protections total revenue to 52 in 2010 as compared to 49 and 48 in 2009 and 2008 respectively net revenue was also favorably impacted by approximately 

69 million or 04 for net acquisitions and divestitures which primarily related to the acquisition of broadview security partially offset by the sale of our french security business 

operating income during 2010 was 16 billion compared to an operating loss of 15 billion during 2009 operating income in 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately 27 billion and legacy legal settlement charges of approximately 125 million during 2009 operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by efficiencies gained from cost containment actions taken in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and restructuring actions taken in prior years restructuring and asset impairment charges decreased to 145 million during 2010 from 232 million during 2009 operating income during 2010 was favorably impacted by net gains on divestitures of 40 million as compared to a loss on divestitures of 15 million during 2009 we also incurred acquisition and integration charges of 35 million during 2010 related to our acquisition of broadview security changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by 80 million during 2010 

as of september 24 2010 our cash balance was 18 billion as compared to 24 billion as of september 25 2009 we generated approximately 26 billion of cash from operating activities which was more than offset by 600 million of cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired primarily related to our acquisition of broadview security accounts purchased by adt and capital expenditures of 13 billion approximately 900 million to repurchase our common shares dividends paid of 416 million and a net debt repayment of 204 million we expect to continue to use our cash to fund internal growth opportunities improve productivity across all of our businesses make acquisitions that strategically fit within our adt worldwide fire protection services and flow control businesses and return capital to shareholders on september 8 2010 our board of directors approved a new 10 billion share repurchase program 2010 repurchase program as the remaining capacity under our existing 10 billion share repurchase program was substantially utilized by the end of august 2010 we did not repurchase any shares under the new program during 2010 

in 2010 we also continued our portfolio refinement efforts by exiting areas that have not provided and are not expected to provide an adequate return on investment and by taking advantage of restructuring opportunities that are expected to provide future cost savings during 2010 we incurred approximately 145 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges substantially completing our 2009 restructuring program during fiscal 2010 we identified additional opportunities for cost savings through restructuring activities in fiscal 2011 we expect to incur restructuring and restructuring related charges of approximately 150 million in fiscal 2011 

over the last few years we have explored alternatives for underperforming or nonstrategic businesses including divestiture we sold our french security business which was part of our adt worldwide segment resulting in a pretax gain of 53 million during 2010 the gain and results of operations of the french security business are presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations have not been met as discussed above during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we announced our intention to sell a 51 interest in our electrical and metal products business see notes 25 to the consolidated financial statements additionally during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our european water business which is part of our flow control segment the business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented on september 30 2010 we received the necessary consents and approval to complete the sale of this business and received net cash proceeds of approximately 267 million we expect to recognize a gain on the transaction

1 as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels has been classified as revenue from product sales during fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2009 and 2008 the sale of the electronic tags and labels was misclassified as service revenue the service revenue and revenue from product sales during fiscal 2009 and 2008 have not been changed for this misclassification as the effect is not material the impact of the misclassification for fiscal 2009 would have been to decrease service revenue by 286 million with corresponding increases to revenue from product sales the impact of the misclassification for fiscal 2008 would have been to decrease service revenue by 364 million with corresponding increases to revenue from product sales 2 certain operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful 37 

revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other life safety systems as well as products related to retailer antitheft systems service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance including the monitoring of burglar alarms fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as other security services

geographically north america net revenue increased 251 million or 60 during 2010 primarily as the result of the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures which favorably impacted net revenue by an estimated 193 million or 46 as the result of the acquisition of broadview security partially offsetting this increase was a decline in systems installation and product sales as the result of continued weakness in the commercial market although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by 48 million or 11 net revenue in emea decreased 137 million or 73 as favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 60 million or 32 were more than offset by a decline in systems installation and other service revenue as a result of continued weakness in the commercial end market although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year additionally emea net revenue was unfavorably impacted by 121 million or 65 due to the impact of divestitures net revenue increased 196 million or 194 in the rest of world geographies primarily due to recurring revenue growth in both latin american and asia pacific regions as adt worldwide continues to focus on building its customer account and recurring revenue base in these markets the asiapacific region experienced an increase in system installation products sales and other service revenue which was 

partially offset by a decrease in the latin american region due to the continued slowdown in commercial and retailer end markets net revenue in the rest of world geographies was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 110 million or 109 

attrition rates decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 as shown in the following table

interest income and expense 

interest income was 31 million in 2010 as compared to 44 million and 112 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in interest income from 2009 primarily related to lower investment yields 

interest expense was 284 million in 2010 as compared to 301 million and 396 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in interest expense is primarily related to savings from interest rate swaps and no amounts being drawn under the revolving credit facilities in 2010 partially offset by additional interest associated with the january and october 2009 debt issuances

income taxes 

effective income tax rate 

our effective income tax rate was 109 for 2010 our tax rate was favorably impacted by pretax income in tax jurisdictions with low tax rates additionally the 2010 tax rate was further reduced by limited tax on certain business dispositions a release of deferred tax valuation allowances and a nonrecurring item generating a tax benefit the effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by goodwill impairment charges of 26 billion for which almost no tax benefit was available additionally taxes for 2009 were positively impacted by increased 

profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of contingency reserves partially offset by enacted tax law changes and changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively impacted the nonus deferred tax assets our effective income tax rate was 235 for 2008 income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the nonus deferred tax assets 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1379 million and 766 million as of september 24 2010 and september 25 2009 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions the valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was morelikelythannot that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 

other income tax matters 

in connection with the spinoffs of covidien and tyco electronics from tyco tyco entered into a tax sharing agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain preseparation income tax liabilities more specifically tyco covidien and tyco electronics share 27 42 and 31 respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and tyco electronics us and certain nonus income tax returns costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties consistent with the sharing provisions of the tax sharing agreement tyco had a net receivable from covidien and tyco electronics of 114 million and 106 million as of september 24 2010 and september 25 2009 respectively in addition as of september 24 2010 tyco had a recorded liability of 554 million of which 156 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and the remaining amount in other liabilities representing the fair value of tycos obligations under the tax sharing agreement as of the date of the separation the liability was 554 million as of september 25 2009 which was recorded in other liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2010 we reclassified 156 million from other liabilities to accrued and other current liabilities as we expect to make a payment within the next twelve months to covidien and tyco electronics related to resolution of certain irs audit matters 

tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments the company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate

2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairments 

annually in the fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if triggering events occur we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets with its carrying amount 

we began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in our adt worldwide fire protection services and safety products segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at our electrical metal products segments although we considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009 the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009 along with downward revisions to forecasted results restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks caused us to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed reporting units within adt worldwide fire protection services and safety products segments continued to be negatively impacted as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market additionally our electrical metal products reporting unit continued to be negatively impacted by a decline in sales volume due to the downturn in the nonresidential construction market we determined that these underlying events and circumstances constituted triggering events for six reporting units where such events would more likely than not reduce the fair value below their respective carrying amounts specifically we concluded that our emea security and emea fire reporting units within the adt worldwide and fire protection services segments our electrical and metal products reporting unit within the electrical and metal products segment and our acvs life safety and sensormatic retail solutions srs reporting units within the safety products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values furthermore we determined that certain indefinitelived intangible assets required impairment testing based on the underlying events and circumstances described as well as the continued deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer end market of our adt worldwide and safety products segments as a result of the triggering events we performed longlived asset goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of our trade names and franchise rights 

fair value of each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows including underlying revenue and operating income growth rates discounted using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital of market participants in determining fair value management relied on and considered a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections including the timing for an economic recovery cash flow forecasts market data and our overall market capitalization based on the factors described above actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting units products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty the estimates of future cash flows used in the second quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from our most recent test conducted during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008 furthermore the range of the weightedaverage cost of capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for our products and services the results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units we recorded an aggregate noncash impairment charge of 26 billion 26 billion aftertax during the second quarter of 2009 the noncash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended march 27 2009 

indefinitelived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights were tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method which include the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and terminal year growth rate assumptions and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows attributable to the underlying intangible assets also during the second quarter of 2009 our estimates of future cash flows used in 

determining the fair value of our safety products segment sensormatic tradename as well as certain adt worldwide segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in our tests during the fourth quarter of 2008 the results of the impairment test indicated that the safety products sensormatic tradename and adt worldwide franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts as a result we recorded an aggregate noncash impairment charge of 64 million 40 million aftertax during the second quarter of 2009 the noncash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended march 27 2009 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

depreciation and amortization methods for security monitoringrelated assets —tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories internally generated residential subscriber systems internally generated commercial subscriber systems collectively referred to as subscriber system assets and customer accounts acquired through the adt dealer program referred to as dealer intangibles subscriber system assets include installed property plant and equipment for which tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber in certain geographical areas where the company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time the company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition the company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets primarily in north america and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years the accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160 to 195 for residential subscriber pools and 145 to 265 for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method the company uses a straightline method with a 14year life for nonpooled subscriber system assets primarily in europe and asia and related deferred revenue with remaining balances written off upon customer termination 

revenue recognition —contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems large security intruder systems and other constructionrelated projects are recorded primarily under the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion the risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in longterm contracts provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable 

product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct indirect and other market participants rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis 

loss contingencies —accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

asbestosrelated contingencies and insurance receivables —we and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials we estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs predominantly based on claim experience over the past five years and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed including related defense costs over the next seven years on an undiscounted basis due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated we use multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss we have concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable estimate as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens 

in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestosrelated matters we record asbestosrelated insurance recoveries that are probable the estimate of asbestosrelated insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims in determining the amount of insurance recoverable we consider a number of factors including available insurance allocation methodologies solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers 

annually we perform a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions used in the estimated asbestosrelated assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset see note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestosrelated assets and liabilities 

income taxes —in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is morelikelythannot the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in 

the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the affect of a tax rate or law change on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairments —goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur in performing these assessments management relies on various factors including operating results business plans economic projections including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery anticipated future cash flows comparable market transactions to the extent available and other market data 

we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates discounted using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for market participants a market approach utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction to the extent available is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss in the second step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 

based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we determined that none of our reporting units with significant goodwill were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions 

made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows 

• a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate ie sales volumes and prices especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets • an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree • volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and • unexpected regulatory changes while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values if our assumptions are not realized it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded however it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 

longlived assets —asset groups held and used by the company including property plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairments to longlived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets the calculation of the fair value of longlived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of longlived assets there is a risk that the carrying value of our longlived assets may be overstated or understated 

pension and postretirement benefits —our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses for active plans such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately 89 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately 7 million we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class historical performance of asset classes over longterm periods asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected longterm return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately 8 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of conducting business we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices accordingly we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject we seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may from time to time include forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency options interest rate swaps commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated nonfunctional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so 

we do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an aa3 longterm debt rating these counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party 

foreign currency exposures 

we hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts during 2010 our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the swiss franc british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar the market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts excluding the dividend hedge contract discussed below is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on september 24 2010 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in an immaterial net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in an immaterial net increase in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 

effective march 17 2009 tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from bermuda to switzerland until the last payment is made in february 2011 tyco intends to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction of capital denominated in swiss francs however the company expects to actually pay these dividends in us dollars based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the us dollar amount required to be paid the company manages the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the swiss franc would result in a 21 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the swiss franc would result in a 25 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the amount of the dividend we would be required to pay 

during the third quarter of 2010 tyco international finance sa tifsa the companys finance subsidiary entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge its euro denominated net investment the aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately 255 million as of september 24 2010 the potential impact from a 10 appreciation of the us 

dollar relative to the euro would result in a 25 million net increase in other comprehensive income conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 30 million net decrease in other comprehensive income 

as of september 24 2010 and september 25 2009 30 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature for the fiscal years ended september 24 2010 and september 25 2009 we recorded 24 million and nil respectively of cumulative translation loss through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans 

interest rate exposures 

our longterm debt portfolio primarily consists of fixedrate instruments the company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes during the third quarter of 2009 first quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2010 the company entered into interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on 14 billion 500 million and 501 million respectively of fixedrate debt to variable rates in these contracts the company agreed with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in connection with the redemption of all of the 6375 public notes due 2011 during the third quarter of 2010 the company terminated the corresponding interest rate swaps as of september 24 2010 and september 25 2009 the total gross notional amount of the companys interest rate swap contracts was 15 billion and 14 billion respectively a 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of september 24 2010 would result in a 37 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of september 24 2010 would result in a 38 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts 

commodity exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may in limited circumstances enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures these exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program during 2010 the company entered into commodity swaps for copper which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes these swaps did not have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the price of copper as of september 24 2010 would not have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined under exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

and that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

backlog 

see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information relating to our backlog 

intellectual property 

patents trademarks copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including trademarks patents and patent applications in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to electronic security systems fire detection systems fire suppression systems fire extinguishers and related products integrated systems for surveillance and control of public transportation and other public works fire protection sprinklers and related systems and products structural and electrical tubing and conduit building structural members panels and related fixtures concrete reinforcing products firerated and armored electrical cabling heat tracing and floor heating systems security wire and fencing and flow control products including valves actuators and controllers and airflow control and sensing products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks 

while we consider our patents to be valuable assets we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents 

research and development 

we are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment our research and development expense was 118 million in 2009 127 million in 2008 and 120 million in 2007 

raw and other purchased materials 

we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including gasoline certain of the components used in the fire protection services business principally certain valves and fittings are purchased for installation in fire protection systems or for distribution materials are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world there have been no shortages in materials that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses however significant changes in certain raw material costs have had and may in the future have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins in particular our electrical and metal products segment is significantly affected by volatility in the price of steel and copper with operating margins generally contracting in a declining price environment and expanding when prices of these commodities are rising we enter into longterm supply contracts using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions 

governmental regulation and supervision 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local consumer protection licensing and other laws and regulations both within and outside the united states for example most us states in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries our adt worldwide business currently relies primarily upon the use of wireline telephone service to communicate signals and wireline telephone companies in the united states are regulated by both the federal and state governments another example is our flow control business which is subject to strict regulations governing the import and export of goods and technologies across international borders particularly with respect to dual use products which are products that may have both civil and military use in addition government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our fire protection services business these and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations both positively and negatively for a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see item 1a risk factors—risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters and item 3 legal proceedings 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and the health and safety of our employees 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations 

given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict based upon our experience current information regarding 

known contingencies and applicable laws we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 31 million to 85 million as of september 25 2009 we concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately 40 million of which 12 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 28 million is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of september 25 2009 we employed approximately 106000 people worldwide of which approximately 38000 are employed in the united states and 68000 are outside the united states approximately 31000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as competition technological obsolescence labor relations general economic conditions geopolitical events climate change and international operations additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and our liquidity 

risks relating to our businesses 

general economic and cyclical industry conditions may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical pattern of certain industries in which we operate for example demand for our services and products is significantly affected by the level of commercial construction the amount of discretionary consumer and business spending and the performance of the housing market each of which historically has displayed significant cyclicality recent economic weakness has adversely affected our businesses for example weakness in the north american and european nonresidential construction markets have adversely impacted the system installation and service portion of our adt worldwide business and weak global economic conditions have also adversely impacted our flow control business continued weakness in the us or global economies or in the industries in which we operate could have a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we face intense competition in each of our businesses and competitive challenges from lower cost manufacturers if we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

we operate in competitive domestic and international markets and compete with many highly competitive manufacturers and service providers both domestically and on a global basis our manufacturing businesses face competition from lower cost manufacturers in asia and elsewhere and our service businesses face competition from alternative service providers around the world key components of our competitive position are our ability to adapt to changing competitive environments and to manage expenses successfully this requires continuous management focus on reducing costs maintaining our competitive position and improving efficiency through cost controls productivity enhancements and regular appraisal of our asset portfolio if we are unable to achieve appropriate levels of scalability or costeffectiveness or if we are otherwise unable to manage and react to changes in the global marketplace our operating results may be adversely affected 

our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards accordingly our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors including our ability to identify emerging technological trends in our target endmarkets develop acquire and maintain competitive products and services enhance our products and services by adding innovative features that differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and develop or acquire manufacture and bring products and services to market quickly and costeffectively our ability to develop or acquire new products and services based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources these acquisitions and development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses and they may not lead to the development of new technologies products or services on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products and services may not develop or grow as we anticipate as a result the failure of our technology products or services to gain market acceptance or their obsolescence could significantly reduce our revenues increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our adt business may experience higher rates of customer attrition which may reduce our future revenue and cause us to change the estimated useful lives of assets related to our security monitoring customers increasing our depreciation and amortization expense 

attrition rates for customers in our adt worldwide business increased over the prior year to an average of 134 on a trailing 12month basis for 2009 as compared to 129 for 2008 and 123 in 2007 although rates have not increased significantly in the last fiscal year if attrition rates continue to trend upward adts recurring revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty tyco amortizes the costs of adts contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the adt dealer program based on the estimated life of the customer relationships internally generated residential and commercial pools are similarly depreciated if attrition rates were to rise tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization of subscriber system assets and intangible assets which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we have significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

we have significant operations outside of the united states we generated 52 of our net revenue outside of the united states in 2009 we expect net revenue generated outside of the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenue business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of certain labor regulations outside of the united states • compliance with a wide variety of nonus laws and regulations • changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets • the threat of nationalization and expropriation • increased costs and risks of doing business in a wide variety of jurisdictions • changes in enacted tax laws • limitations on repatriation of earnings and • fluctuations in equity and revenues due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition result of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our net revenue derived from sales in nonus markets for 2009 was 52 of our total net revenue and we expect revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net revenue therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the foreign countries where we sell our products and services compared to prior periods our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease and viceversa changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances may have a significant effect on our results of operations our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our functional currency 

in addition we are a large buyer of metals and other commodities including fossil fuels for our manufacturing operations and our vehicle fleet the prices of which have fluctuated significantly in recent years increases in the prices of some of these commodities could increase the costs of manufacturing our products and providing our services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or otherwise effectively manage price volatility and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows further in a declining price environment our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the firstin firstout method this is most pronounced in our electrical and metal products segment where declining copper and steel prices along with volume declines negatively affected our margins in 2009 

we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we enter into hedge contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations these hedges are subject to the risk that our counterparty may not perform as a result changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell businesses or product lines any divestiture could result in significant asset impairment charges including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain environmental or other contingent liabilities related to the divested business we cannot assure you that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing businesses these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of management time and attention from daily operations • difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business • inability to obtain required regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms • potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us and 13 

• assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of materials components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis or if our manufacturing capacity does not meet demand our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may suffer 

we purchase materials components and equipment from thirdparties for use in our manufacturing operations if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase in addition because we cannot always immediately adapt our cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

failure to retain or attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 

the companys culture and guiding principles focus on continuously training motivating and developing employees and in particular it strives to attract motivate and retain qualified managers to handle the daytoday operations of a highly diversified organization if we fail to retain and attract qualified personnel the companys operations could be adversely affected in addition excessive turnover in personnel could cause manufacturing inefficiencies in certain of our businesses the demand for experienced management in certain geographic areas also makes it difficult to retain qualified employees high turnover could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could adversely impact the companys operating results 

we have recently recognized substantial impairment charges and may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in the future 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to periodically assess our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments during the quarter ended march 27 2009 we recognized aggregate goodwill and intangible asset impairments of 27 billion resulting primarily from a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market in certain of our businesses a decline in sales volume at our electrical and metal products segment and downward revisions to forecasted results restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks as a result the company recognized an aggregate goodwill impairment of 26 billion 26 billion aftertax at six of our reporting units and intangible asset impairments of 64 million 40 million aftertax related to franchise rights in our adt worldwide segment and a tradename in our safety products segment the company believes that our goodwill balance as of september 25 2009 is recoverable however fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment analysis future impairment 

charges could materially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

we are named as a defendant in a variety of litigation that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are named as a defendant in a significant amount of litigation including claims for damages arising out of the use or installation of our products or services litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights litigation alleging anticompetitive behavior litigation related to environmental matters product liability litigation including asbestosrelated claims litigation alleging violations of federal and state securities laws employee matters and commercial disputes in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 

legislative action by the us congress could materially adversely affect us despite our change of domicile 

legislative action could be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties upon which we rely which would adversely affect our effective corporate tax rate despite our change of domicile we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals however if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our march 2009 change of domicile from bermuda to switzerland or limiting our ability as a swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between switzerland and the united states we could be subjected to increased taxation also various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that deny or would deny government contracts to us companies that move their locations abroad we cannot assure you that moving our jurisdiction of incorporation to switzerland has eliminated the risk that these contract bans will apply to us 

in addition there continues to be negative publicity regarding and criticism of companies that conduct substantial business in the us but are domiciled abroad we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such criticism as a result of our domicile in switzerland 

changes in legislation or governmental regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we operate in regulated industries our us operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal state and local governmental agencies with respect to safety of operations and equipment labor and employment matters and financial responsibility intrastate operations in the united states are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities and our international operations are regulated by the countries in which they operate and by extraterritorial laws we and our employees are subject to various us federal state and local laws and regulations as well as nonus laws and regulations including many related to consumer protection most states in which we operate have licensing laws covering the monitored security services industry and the construction industry our adt worldwide business relies heavily upon wireline telephone service to communicate signals and wireline telephone companies are regulated by both the federal and state governments changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt 

operations in addition failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses if laws and regulations changed or we failed to comply our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws outside the united states 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in fcpa enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental and commercial corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents furthermore we have been subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments have been made by our subsidiaries and agents in recent years in violation of the fcpa we have reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that we have taken in response to the allegations and our own internal investigations we also retained outside counsel to perform a companywide baseline review of our policies controls and practices with respect to the fcpa and we periodically provide updates to the sec and doj regarding our fcpa investigations and compliance activities as a result it is possible that we will be required to pay material fines consent to injunctions on future conduct or suffer other civil or criminal penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to securities litigation or a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations cash flows business prospects or the market value of our stock 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and international trade laws when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor foreign laws such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and our business prospects 

we continue to be responsible for a portion of our contingent and other corporate liabilities following the separation primarily those relating to shareholder litigation and preseparation income tax liabilities 

under the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements subject to certain exceptions contained in the tax sharing agreement we covidien and tyco electronics have agreed to assume and be responsible for 27 42 and 31 respectively of certain of our contingent and other corporate liabilities all costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities will be shared equally among the parties these contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to legacy securities litigation and any actions with respect to the separation plan or the separation brought by any third party as well as preseparation income tax liabilities liabilities that are specifically related to one of the three separated companies are not allocated 

if any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment when due of any of these assumed obligations each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities including associated costs and expenses 

we could face product liability and asbestos claims relating to products we manufacture or install these claims could result in significant costs and liabilities and reduce our profitability 

we face exposure to product liability claims in the event that any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in addition if any of our products prove to be defective we may be required to recall or redesign such products which could result in significant unexpected costs we have been named in a significant number of lawsuits alleging damages based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos through the past distribution of asbestoscontaining industrial products any insurance we maintain may not be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition we could face liability for failure to respond adequately to alarm activations or failure of our fire protection systems to operate as expected the nature of the services we provide potentially exposes us to risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failures in an attempt to reduce this risk our alarm monitoring agreements and other contracts contain provisions limiting our liability in such circumstances we cannot assure you however that these limitations will be enforced losses from such litigation could be material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and • the health and safety of our employees we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have received notification from the united states environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites andor for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations these projects relate to a variety of activities including 

• solvent metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and • oil spill equipment upgrades and replacement 17 

these projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us 

the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs of approximately 40 million of which 12 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and 28 million is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of september 25 2009 environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may also be subject to material liabilities for additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities or for existing environmental conditions of which we are not presently aware 

risks related to our liquidity 

recent disruptions in the financial markets could have adverse effects on us our customers and our suppliers as access to liquidity may be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets leading to increased funding costs or unavailability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of common shares capital expenditures and investments in the companys subsidiaries although we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our current needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets in 2009 global credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions and continued uncertainty in the credit markets may make financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets to meet our needs in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing these disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slow down in general economic activity that we expect to continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse affects based on these conditions our profitability and our ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants including a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and limits on incurrence of liens and subsidiary debt our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions 

although we believe none of these covenants are restrictive to our operations our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 

if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

we estimate that our available cash our cash flow from operations and amounts available to us under our revolving lines of credit will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future however material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements arising from our pending investigations and litigation could require additional funding if such developments require us to obtain additional funding we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

such an outcome could have important consequences to you for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes including debt reduction or dividend payments • increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions • limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate • restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities • make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness and • increase the difficulty andor cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness risks relating to tax matters 

examinations and audits by tax authorities including the internal revenue service could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded through the income tax provision equity or goodwill as appropriate the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances 

in 2004 in connection with the irs audit of the 1997 through 2000 years the company submitted to the irs proposed adjustments to certain prior period us federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed during 2006 the irs accepted substantially all of the 

proposed adjustments subsequently the company developed proposed amendments to us federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2006 on the basis of previously accepted amendments the company has determined that these adjustments will morelikelythannot be accepted and accordingly has recorded such adjustments in the consolidated financial statements such adjustments did not have a material impact on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows while the final adjustments cannot be determined until the irs review is completed the company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and tyco electronics income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including june 29 2007 

under the tax sharing agreement we share responsibility for certain of our covidiens and tyco electronics income tax liabilities which result in cash payments based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 more specifically we covidien and tyco electronics share 27 42 and 31 respectively of us income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our covidiens and tyco electronics us and certain nonus income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities will be shared equally among the parties we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition covidien and tyco electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our covidiens and tyco electronics tax liabilities 

if the distribution of covidien and tyco electronics common shares to our shareholders or certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we have received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of covidien and tyco electronics common shares to our shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution of such shares except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the code the private letter rulings relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco covidien and tyco electronics regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable we would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the covidien and tyco electronics common shares distributed 

to our shareholders on june 29 2007 over our tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately is determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the separation should be treated as taxable transactions 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in switzerland 

swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of tycos securities 

tyco international has changed its place of incorporation from bermuda to switzerland because of differences between swiss law and bermuda law and differences between the governing documents of swiss and bermuda companies it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against tyco international based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states in switzerland as a result in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws us investors may find it difficult to 

• effect service within the united states upon tyco or its directors and officers located outside the united states • enforce judgments obtained against those persons in us courts or in courts in jurisdictions outside the united states and • enforce against those persons in switzerland whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of us courts civil liabilities based solely upon the us federal or state securities laws switzerland and the united states do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the united states in switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a nonswiss court may be enforced in switzerland only if 

• the foreign court had jurisdiction pursuant to the swiss federal act on private international law • the judgment of such foreign court has become final and nonappealable • the judgment does not contravene swiss public policy • the court procedures and the service of documents leading to the judgment were in accordance with the due process of law and • no proceeding involving the same position and the same subject matter was first brought in switzerland or adjudicated in switzerland or that it was earlier adjudicated in a third state and this decision is recognizable in switzerland until january 1 2011 tyco must declare and pay dividends in the form of reductions of registered share capital which must be stated in swiss francs to avoid adverse tax consequences any currency fluctuations between the us dollar and swiss francs will affect the dollar value of the dividends tyco pays 

under swiss law payments that are made to shareholders in the form of a return of registered share capital do not require the payment of withholding taxes to swiss authorities while ordinary dividend payments require that such taxes be withheld swiss corporate law requires that any payments made to shareholders in the form of a return of capital must be denominated in swiss francs after january 1 2011 dividend payments may be made out of contributed surplus without having to pay withholding taxes and these payments can be denominated and paid in us dollars therefore until 

january 1 2011 we expect to pay dividends in the form of a return of registered share capital and these dividends will be denominated in swiss francs we expect our transfer agent to make these dividend payments in us dollars converted at the us dollar to swiss franc exchange rate shortly before the payment date as a result shareholders will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the swiss franc between the date used for purposes of calculating the swiss franc amount of any proposed capital reduction which will typically be on or about the date of our annual general meeting and the relevant payment date which will not be shorter than two months and could be as long as a year 

as a result of our change of domicile and the increase in the par value of our shares we may have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

in connection with the change of domicile we significantly increased the par value of our shares currently the par value of our shares is chf 807 or approximately 787 based on the exchange rate in effect on november 2 2009 under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value as of november 2 2009 the closing price of our ordinary shares on the nyse was 3353 in the event there is a need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our registered shares is below our par value we would need to obtain approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our registered shares we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval obtaining shareholder approval also would require filing a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convening a meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans if we were to receive shareholder approval to reduce the par value of our registered shares the reduction would decrease our ability to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital which may subject you to swiss withholding tax

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product and general liability matters environmental matters patent infringement claims employment disputes disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes 

in connection with the separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain legal actions that were pending against tyco prior to the separation under the separation and distribution agreement we covidien and tyco electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of any judgments resulting from the actions subject to the agreement which generally relate to legacy matters that are not specific to the business operations of any of the companies the separation and distribution agreement also provides that we will be responsible for 27 covidien 42 and tyco electronics 31 of payments to resolve these matters with costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingencies being shared equally among the parties in addition under the agreement we will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the separation and distribution agreement including the defense or settlement thereof subject to certain limitations additionally at the time of the separation the company covidien and tyco electronics agreed to allocate responsibility for certain legacy tax claims pursuant to the same formula under the tax sharing agreement see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our tax sharing agreement 

class action settlement and legacy securities matters 

as previously reported tyco and some members of the companys former senior corporate management were named as defendants in a number of lawsuits alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws 

in june 2007 the company settled 32 purported securities class action lawsuits arising from actions alleged to have been taken by prior management for 2975 billion of this amount the company contributed 803 million representing its share under the separation and distribution agreement 

the june 2007 class action settlement did not purport to resolve all legacy securities cases and several remain outstanding the most significant of which is stumpf v tyco international ltd  which is a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs allege that tyco among others violated the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws the matter arises from tycos july 2000 initial public offering of common stock of tycom inc and alleges that the tycom registration statement and prospectus relating to the sale of common stock were inaccurate misleading and failed to disclose facts necessary to make the registration statement and prospectus not misleading the complaint further alleges the defendants violated securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning among other things executive compensation tycoms business prospects and tycos and tycoms finances the matter is currently in the pretrial stages of litigation 

in the first half of fiscal 2009 the company settled a number of legal matters stemming from alleged violations of federal securities laws committed by former senior management including several lawsuits from plaintiffs that had opted out of the june 2007 class action settlement for an aggregate amount of approximately 90 million pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the 

companys share of this amount was approximately 24 million with covidien and tyco electronics responsible for approximately 38 million and 28 million respectively 

during the second quarter of 2009 the company concluded that its best estimate of probable loss for the legacy securities matters outstanding at the time was 375 million in the aggregate which the company recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of march 27 2009 due to the sharing provisions in the separation and distribution agreement described above the company also recorded receivables from covidien and tyco electronics in the amounts of 158 million and 116 million respectively which were recorded in other current assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet as of march 27 2009 as a result the company recorded a net charge of 101 million related to legacy securities matters during the quarter ended march 27 2009 in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 

in the second half of fiscal 2009 the company agreed to settle with all of the remaining plaintiffs that had optedout of the class action settlement as well as plaintiffs who had brought employee retirement income security act erisa related claims for a total of 271 million pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the companys share of the settlement amount was approximately 73 million with covidien and tyco electronics responsible for approximately 114 million and 84 million respectively this settlement activity did not result in the company recording a charge to its consolidated statements of operations as the company had established a reserve for its best estimate of the amount of loss during the second quarter of 2009 as discussed above 

the company continues to believe that the accrual remaining as of september 25 2009 is its best estimate for the remaining unresolved claims although the company has reserved its best estimate of probable loss related to unresolved legacy securities claims their ultimate resolution could differ from this estimate and could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition to the stumpf matter tyco is a party to several lawsuits based on alleged violations of federal securities laws fraud and negligence committed by former management these previously reported matters consist of jasin v tyco international ltd et al  an action brought by a pro se plaintiff hall v kozlowski et al  an action brought by a pro se plaintiff relating to the plaintiffs employment 401k pension plans and ownership of tyco common stock and several affirmative actions brought by tyco against messrs kozlowski swartz and walsh former executives and a director of tyco in connection with our affirmative actions messrs kozlowski and swartz have made counterclaims seeking amounts allegedly due in connection with the former executives compensation and retention arrangements and under erisa and mr walsh has made claims alleging that tyco is required to indemnify him for his defense costs arising from his role as a tyco director tyco intends to vigorously defend each of these actions and does not believe that the ultimate outcome of any of these matters will have a material adverse affect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement each of tyco covidien and tyco electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of any legacy securities matters excluding the counterclaims brought by former executives and a director described above 

environmental matters 

tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to known environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods as of september 25 2009 tyco concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 31 million to 85 million as of september 25 2009 tyco concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately

asbestos matters 

the company and certain of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in bodily injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while the company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts the companys strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed the company cannot predict the extent to which it will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future of the lawsuits that have proceeded to trial since 2005 the company has won or settled all but one case with that one case returning an adverse jury verdict for approximately 77 million which included both compensatory and punitive damages the company has appealed the verdict and believes that it will ultimately be overturned as of september 25 2009 there were 4200 lawsuits pending against the company and its subsidiaries each lawsuit typically includes several claims and the company has determined that it had 5509 6569 and 6461 claims outstanding as of september 25 2009 september 26 2008 and september 28 2007 respectively these amounts reflect adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identify incorrect defendants or are duplicative of other actions for a detailed discussion of asbestosrelated matters see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

income tax matters 

the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded through the income tax provision equity or goodwill as appropriate the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances 

in 2004 in connection with the irs audit of the 1997 through 2000 years the company submitted to the irs proposed adjustments to certain prior period us federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed during 2006 the irs accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments subsequently the company developed proposed amendments to us federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2006 on the basis of previously accepted amendments the company has determined that these adjustments will morelikelythannot be accepted and accordingly has recorded such adjustments in the consolidated financial statements such adjustments did not have a material impact on the companys financial condition results of 

operations or cash flows while the final adjustments cannot be determined until the irs review is completed the company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows for a detailed discussion of income tax matters see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

compliance matters 

as previously reported in our periodic filings the company has received and responded to various allegations and other information that certain improper payments were made by our subsidiaries and agents in recent years for example two subsidiaries in our flow control business in italy have been charged along with numerous other parties in connection with the milan public prosecutors investigation into allegedly improper payments made to certain italian entities and we have reported to german authorities potentially improper conduct involving agents retained by our emea water business we have reported to the us department of justice doj and the sec the investigative steps and remedial measures that we have taken in response to these allegations and its internal investigations we also informed the doj and the sec that we retained outside counsel to perform a companywide baseline review of our policies controls and practices with respect to compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and that we would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies we have and will continue to communicate with the doj and sec to provide updates on the baseline review and followup investigations including as appropriate briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by us in the course of our ongoing compliance activities the baseline review revealed that some business practices may not comply with tyco and fcpa requirements at this time we cannot predict the outcome of these matters and other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk if any that may result from an adverse resolution of these matters however it is possible that we may be required to pay material fines consent to injunctions on future conduct or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

covidien and tyco electronics agreed in connection with the separation to cooperate with the company in its response regarding these matters any judgment required to be paid or settlement or other cost incurred by the company in connection with the fcpa investigations would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the separation and distribution agreement which assigned liabilities primarily related to the former healthcare and electronics businesses of tyco to covidien or tyco electronics respectively and provides that tyco will retain liabilities primarily related to its continuing operations any liabilities not primarily related to a particular business will be shared equally among tyco covidien and tyco electronics 

the german federal cartel office fco charged in early 2007 that certain german subsidiaries in the companys flow control business have engaged in anticompetitive practices in particular with regard to its hydrant valve street box and fittings business the company investigated this matter and determined that the conduct may have violated german antitrust law the company is cooperating with the fco in its investigation of this violation which is ongoing the company cannot estimate the range of potential loss that may result from this violation it is possible that the company may be subject to civil or criminal proceedings and may be required to pay judgments suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

erisa partial withdrawal liability assessment and demand 

on june 8 2007 simplexgrinnell received a notice alleging that it had partially withdrawn from the national automatic sprinkler industry pension fund the fund under title iv of erisa if 

the fund can prove that an employer completely or partially withdraws from a multiemployer pension plan such as the fund the employer is liable for withdrawal liability equal to its proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested benefits the alleged withdrawal results from a 1994 labor dispute between grinnell fire protection systems simplexgrinnells predecessor and road sprinkler fitters local union no 669 

erisa requires that payment of withdrawal liability be made in full or in quarterly installments commencing upon receipt of a liability assessment from the plan a plans assessment of withdrawal liability generally may be challenged only in arbitration and erisa requires that quarterly payments must continue to be made during the pendency of the arbitration if the employer prevails in arbitration and any subsequent court appeals its quarterly withdrawal liability payments are refunded with interest the funds total withdrawal liability assessment against simplexgrinnell is approximately 25 million the quarterly withdrawal liability payments are 11 million 11 million of which have been paid to date while the ultimate outcome is uncertain simplexgrinnell believes that it has strong arguments that no withdrawal liability is owed to the fund and it plans to vigorously defend against the funds withdrawal liability assessment the matter is currently in arbitration the company has made no provision for this contingency and believes that its quarterly payments are recoverable 

other matters 

as previously reported in 2002 the secs division of enforcement conducted an investigation related to past accounting practices for dealer connect fees that adt had charged to its authorized dealers upon purchasing customer accounts the investigation related to accounting practices employed by our former management which were discontinued in 2003 although we settled with the sec in 2006 a number of former dealers and related parties have filed lawsuits against us including a class action lawsuit filed in the district court of arapahoe county colorado alleging breach of contract and other claims related to adts decision to terminate certain authorized dealers in 2002 and 2003 while it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these lawsuits we do not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition to the foregoing we are subject to claims and suits including from time to time contractual disputes and product and general liability claims incidental to present and former operations acquisitions and dispositions with respect to many of these claims we either selfinsure or maintain insurance through thirdparties with varying deductibles while the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of any such proceedings whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows beyond amounts recorded for such matters

dividend policy 

pursuant to swiss law dividend payments made prior to january 1 2011 are subject to swiss withholding taxes unless made in the form of a return of capital from our registered share capital as a result we intend to first pay dividends in the form of a reduction of registered share capital denominated in swiss francs until at least january 1 2011 however we expect to actually pay dividends in us dollars based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the us dollar amount required to be paid we manage the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk after january 1 2011 we expect to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction in contributed surplus which also may be made free of swiss withholding taxes we expect to obtain shareholder approval of an annual dividend amount each year at our annual general meeting and we expect to distribute the approved dividend amount in four quarterly installments the timing of which will be determined by our board of directors the timing declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will depend upon many factors including our financial condition and results of operations the capital requirements of our businesses industry practice and any other relevant factors future dividends will be proposed by our board of directors and as stated above require shareholder approval dividends paid from contributed surplus also require shareholder approval but may be denominated and paid in us dollars

overview and outlook 

overall fiscal year 2009 results were negatively affected by the economic downturn which adversely impacted our businesses across nearly all geographies and industries revenue decreased by 30 billion or 147 compared to 2008 and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were largely responsible for an operating loss of 15 billion for the year compared to operating income of 19 billion in 2008 approximately one half of the 2009 revenue decline was due to the general strengthening of the us dollar during 2009 as over half of our revenue is generated outside the us the remaining revenue decline was due in large part to our electrical and metal products business 

which saw historically low volumes in 2009 the impact of the weakened global economy on product and systems installation revenue also significantly contributed to the yearoveryear decline on the other hand service revenue continued to grow as a percentage of our overall revenue from 35 in 2008 to 39 in 2009 our service revenues are principally derived from our adt worldwide and fire protection services businesses and represent a predictable and consistent source of revenue recurring revenue in our adt worldwide business now represents approximately 55 of adts total revenue compared to approximately 50 in 2008 in the fire protection services business service revenue increased as a percentage of fire protections total revenue from 48 in 2008 to 49 in 2009 

operating income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 due in large part to noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately 27 billion during 2009 operating income was also negatively affected by charges related to restructuring asset impairment and divestiture activity of approximately 251 million and charges related to legacy legal matters of approximately 125 million to a lesser degree operating income was negatively impacted by reduced volumes due to the economic downturn operating income benefited from a number of key cost containment actions taken in 2009 and 2008 as well as restructuring actions taken in prior periods we continue to be aggressive in identifying cost saving opportunities and restructuring activities that should benefit the company when the economy improves during 2010 we expect to incur an additional 100 million to 150 million of charges related to restructuring activity 

as of september 25 2009 the companys cash balance was 24 billion as compared to 15 billion as of september 26 2008 the increase from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to cash flow from operating activities and proceeds received from the issuance of longterm debt in 2010 we expect to continue to use our cash to fund internal growth opportunities improve productivity across all of our businesses make acquisitions that strategically fit within our adt worldwide fire protection services and flow control businesses and return capital to shareholders in 2010 we expect to continue our portfolio refinement efforts by exiting areas that have not provided and are not expected to provide an adequate return on investment finally in 2010 we will continue to focus on growing revenue in key emerging markets and as noted above taking advantage of restructuring opportunities that are expected to provide significant future cost savings 

goodwill and intangible asset impairments 

annually in the fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if triggering events occur the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets with its carrying amount 

during the second quarter of 2009 the company concluded that its emea security and emea fire reporting units within the adt worldwide and fire protection services segments respectively electrical and metal products reporting unit within the electrical and metal products segment and access control and video systems acvs life safety and sensormatic retail solutions srs reporting units within the safety products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values as a result of the triggering events the company performed longlived asset goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of the companys trade names and franchise rights the results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units the company recorded an aggregate noncash impairment charge of 26 billion 26 billion aftertax during the second quarter of 2009 the noncash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the companys consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended march 27 2009 

also during the second quarter of 2009 the companys estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of its safety products segment sensormatic tradename as well as certain 

adt worldwide segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in the companys tests during the fourth quarter of 2008 the results of the impairment test indicated that the safety products sensormatic tradename and adt worldwide franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts as a result the company recorded an aggregate noncash impairment charge of 64 million 40 million aftertax during the second quarter of 2009 the noncash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the companys consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ended march 27 2009 

operating results 

net revenue operating loss income and net loss income for the years ended september 25 2009 september 26 2008 and september 28 2007 were as follows  in millions 



net revenue decreased 30 billion or 147 for 2009 as compared to 2008 in large part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which negatively affected 2009 by 15 billion the remaining decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower volume of steel products in our electrical and metal products segment and weakness in the commercial markets including the retailer end market which negatively impacted our adt worldwide and safety products segments revenues were positively affected by 110 million for acquisitions and divestitures primarily in our adt worldwide segment 

operating income decreased 34 billion to an operating loss of 15 billion for 2009 the operating loss included an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of 26 billion relating to reporting units in our electrical and metal products adt worldwide fire protection services and safety products segments and intangible asset impairment charges of 64 million relating to assets at our adt worldwide and safety products segments for 2009 additionally lower volumes primarily in our electrical and metal products and safety products segments negatively impacted operating income in addition 2009 included legacy legal settlement charges of 125 million as well as restructuring asset impairment and divestiture charges net of 251 million operating income for 2008 included separation related costs of 4 million restructuring asset impairment and divestiture charges net of 247 million and a legacy settlement charge of 29 million offset by a credit of 10 million for class action settlement recoveries changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected operating income by 61 million for 2009

net revenue for adt worldwide decreased 716 million or 93 during 2009 as compared to 2008 this decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 590 million revenue was positively affected by 152 million for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures revenue from product sales decreased 166 and service revenue decreased 54 revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other systems service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance including the monitoring of burglar alarms fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as services related to retailer antitheft systems approximately 55 of adts total net revenue is contractual and is considered recurring revenue recurring revenue declined 36 during 2009 primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which unfavorably impacted recurring revenue by 75 offset by growth in north america and asia systems installation and service revenue declined 153 partially due to a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which unfavorably impacted system installation and service revenue by 83 and lower sales volume due to continued weakness in the commercial markets including the retailer end market geographically revenue in north america decreased 48 million or 11 resulting from reduced spending primarily in the commercial markets including the retailer end market revenue in emea decreased 521 million or 221 largely as a result of foreign currency exchange rates which had an unfavorable impact of 323 million the remaining decrease in emea was primarily a result of a decline in systems installation and service revenue due to a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market revenue declined 147 million or 127 in the rest of world geographies which was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 219 million partially offset by growth in asia and latin america 

attrition rates for customers in our adt worldwide business increased over the prior year to 134 on a trailing 12month basis for 2009 as compared to 129 for 2008 and 123 in 2007 the increased attrition was primarily due to adverse market conditions in the united kingdom continental europe south africa asia and australia 

operating income in 2009 decreased 673 million as compared to 2008 based on the deterioration in the commercial markets including the retailer end market discussed above the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 613 million related to its adt emea reporting unit and intangible asset impairment charges of 22 million related to certain franchise rights within north america during the second quarter of 2009 the decrease is also related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 44 million the decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume as well as an increase in bad debt charges both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets including the retailer end market and the current adverse global economic conditions additionally advertising costs increased which adversely affected operating income operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring asset impairment and divestiture charges of 87 million in 2009 operating income in 2008 included restructuring charges of 94 million and expenses of 51 million primarily to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmission in north america there were no charges related to converting customers to digital signal during 2009 the decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions 

net revenue for adt worldwide increased 443 million or 61 during 2008 with product revenue up 50 and service revenue up 67 as compared to 2007 approximately 50 of adts total net revenue is contractual and is considered recurring revenue overall recurring revenue grew 72 during 2008 while systems installation and service revenue grew 49 geographically north america grew 3 resulting largely from growth in recurring revenue which was partially offset by weakness in the retailer end market the north america net revenue increase also includes the impact of acquisitions which contributed 53 million the yearoveryear net revenue increase in north america was partially offset by weakness in the retailer end market during the fourth quarter of 2008 revenue in the emea region increased 141 million or 64 as a result of foreign currency exchange rates which had a favorable impact of 142 million this increase was partially offset by a decline in systems installation and service revenue due to weakness in the retailer end market as well as commercial softness primarily in the united kingdom the 182 revenue growth in the rest of world geographies was primarily driven by growth in both recurring revenue and contracting across all regions the rest of the world increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 30 million overall the adt worldwide net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 204 million the net impact of acquisitions divestitures and other activity positively affected revenue by 27 million 

operating margin in adt worldwide increased to 117 in 2008 from 112 in 2007 north america is one of the most profitable geographic areas for adt worldwide with 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 158 and 169 respectively margins in north america were negatively impacted by 57 million of restructuring and asset impairments in 2008 compared to 6 million in 2007 restructuring charges in 2008 include 58 million relating to the reacquisition of certain franchise rights that were deemed to be unfavorable to the company there were no charges related to the reacquisition of franchise rights in 2007 in addition north america incurred 48 million and 12 million to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in 2008 and 2007 respectively north america operating margins benefited from growth in recurring revenue partially offset by declines in the retailer end market adt emea had 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 50 and 25 respectively emeas operating income included 34 million of restructuring and impairments in 2008 compared with 67 million in 2007 emea margins benefited from reduced costs as a result of the restructuring program which was partially offset by volume decreases as discussed above 

operating income in 2008 increased 89 million or 109 as compared to 2007 factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume particularly our higher margin recurring revenue operational efficiencies including those achieved from restructuring activities in europe lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower longlived asset impairment charges the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense occurred primarily in north america and resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense was partially offset by increased net expenses of 51 million which primarily related to converting customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in north america results for 2007 include goodwill impairment charges due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure following the separation

income taxes 

effective income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by the goodwill impairment charges of 26 billion for which almost no tax benefit is available our effective income tax rate was 234 for 2008 income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the nonus deferred tax assets the effective tax rate for 2007 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the class action settlement charge net of 2862 billion and the loss on early extinguishment of debt of 259 million for which no tax benefit is available additionally taxes for 2007 were negatively impacted by tax costs related to the separation and were favorably impacted by the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to nonus tax rulings received during the period and reduced reserve requirements on certain legacy tax matters 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 791 million and 742 million as of september 25 2009 and september 26 2008 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions the valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was morelikelythannot that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 

other income tax matters 

in connection with the spinoffs of covidien and tyco electronics from tyco tyco entered into a tax sharing agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain preseparation income tax liabilities more specifically tyco covidien and tyco electronics share 27 42 and 31 respectively of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and tyco electronics us and certain nonus income tax returns all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties consistent with the sharing provisions of the tax sharing agreement tyco had a net receivable from covidien and tyco electronics of 98 million and 126 million as of september 25 2009 and september 26 2008 respectively in addition as of both september 25 2009 and september 26 2008 tyco had a recorded liability of 554 million representing the fair value of tycos obligations under the tax sharing agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

depreciation and amortization methods for security monitoringrelated assets —tyco generally considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories internally generated residential subscriber systems internally generated commercial subscriber systems collectively referred to as subscriber system assets and customer accounts acquired through the adt dealer program referred to as dealer intangibles subscriber system assets include installed property plant and equipment for which tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber in certain geographical areas where the company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time the company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition 

effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007 tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets primarily in north america and related deferred revenue from the straightline method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years the accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160 to 195 for residential subscriber pools and 145 to 265 for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straightline methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method the company will continue to use a straightline method with a 14year life for nonpooled subscriber system assets primarily in europe and asia and related deferred revenue with remaining balances written off upon customer termination 

the change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas demand competition and the estimated technological life of the installed systems the pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery customer satisfaction and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base all pertinent factors including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas demand competition and the estimated technological life of the installed systems will continue to be reviewed by the company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful lives 

effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007 tyco also changed the estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90 of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years the company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis the change in the estimated useful life used to account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors including actual customer attrition data demand competition and the estimated technological life of the installed systems the pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery customer satisfaction and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base 

attrition rates for customers in our adt worldwide business were 134 129 and 123 on a trailing 12month basis for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

revenue recognition —contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems large security intruder systems and other constructionrelated projects are recorded primarily under the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion the risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in longterm contracts revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable if estimates are inaccurate there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated 

product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct indirect and other market participants rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis 

loss contingencies —accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes —in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is morelikelythannot the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not currently aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately 

proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairments —goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur in performing these assessments management relies on various factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions and other market data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors which require judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment analyses there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may be overstated 

we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the first step of the goodwill impairment test the company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the companys future budgets discounted using the market participants weightedaverage cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss in the second step of the goodwill impairment test the company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined the company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 

longlived assets —assets held and used by the company including property plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairments to longlived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets the calculation of the fair value of longlived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of longlived assets there is a risk that the carrying value of our longlived assets may be overstated or understated 

pension and postretirement benefits —our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of 

pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately 77 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately 7 million for fiscal 2010 we expect that recent declines in interest rates will increase our pension expense but is not expected to materially increase required contributions 

liquidity and capital resources 

on september 30 2009 tyco international finance sa tifsa issued 500 million aggregate principle amount of 4125 notes due 2014 the 2014 notes which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company tifsa received net proceeds of approximately 496 million after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses

additionally in january 2009 we repaid the entire outstanding balance of 686 million on our revolving credit facilities as of september 25 2009 there were no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities as of september 25 2009 the aggregate available commitment under our senior revolving credit facilities was 169 billion 200 million of which was dedicated to backstop all of our commercial paper outstanding as of such date we continually monitor developments regarding the availability of funds under our revolving credit facilities although there is some risk that financial institutions will fail to perform their contractual obligations particularly in times of credit market distress we believe that the lenders under our revolving credit facilities are capable of meeting any borrowing requests we may make for the foreseeable future 

as discussed above as of september 25 2009 we had 200 million of commercial paper outstanding we continue to experience increased availability within the commercial paper markets our multiyear revolving credit facilities serve as a backstop to our commercial paper program 

in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows additional sources of potential liquidity include committed credit lines our commercial paper program public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivable we continue to balance our operating investing and financing uses of cash through investment in our existing core businesses strategic acquisitions and divestitures dividends and share repurchases we believe our cash position amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs 

as a result of recent declines in interest rates during 2009 pension costs may increase in fiscal 2010 we will continue to monitor market conditions and assess the impact if any on our financial position results of operations or cash flows approximately 100 of our us and more than 95 of our nonus funded pension plans are invested in marketable investments including publiclytraded 

equity and fixed income securities although we do not believe we will be required to make materially higher cash contributions in the next 12 months if market conditions worsen we may be required to make incremental cash contributions under local statutory law 

the sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended september 25 2009 september 26 2008 and september 28 2007 were as follows  in millions 



1 includes depreciation expense of 617 million 626 million and 635 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and amortization of intangible assets of 516 million 528 million and 513 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 2 includes net proceeds of 13 million 28 million and 23 million received for the saledisposition of property plant and equipment in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

the net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by 142 million in 2009 the components of this change are set forth in detail in the consolidated statements of cash flows the significant changes in working capital included a 367 million decrease in inventory a 207 million decrease in accounts receivable a 106 million decrease in contracts in progress offset by a 352 million decrease in accounts payable and a 148 million decrease in income taxes net 

during 2009 we completed the sale of all of our remaining infrastructure services businesses for net cash proceeds of 66 million 

we continue to fund capital expenditures to grow our business improve the cost structure of our businesses to invest in new processes and technology and to maintain high quality production standards the level of capital expenditures in 2010 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2009 and is also expected to exceed depreciation 

during 2009 2008 and 2007 we paid out 154 million 187 million and 70 million respectively in cash related to restructuring activities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities 

income taxes paid net of refunds related to continuing operations was 291 million 501 million and 649 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively

as previously discussed effective june 29 2007 we completed the separation in connection with the separation we paid 68 million and 349 million in separation costs during 2008 and 2007 respectively of these amounts 36 million and 256 million were included in cash flows from discontinued operating activities respectively 

during the second quarter of 2008 tyco released 2960 million of funds placed in escrow during the third quarter of 2007 as well as 60 million of interest earned on those funds for the benefit of the class as stipulated in the courts final order related to the class action settlement 

we will continue to divest businesses that do not align with our overall strategy we expect to use the proceeds from these sales as well as the cash generated by our operations to continue to make investments in our businesses that are intended to grow revenue and improve productivity including our restructuring actions we expect to also use cash to selectively pursue acquisitions 

pursuant to our share repurchase program we may repurchase tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices in negotiated transactions off the market or pursuant to an approved 10b51 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations 

management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future including quarterly dividend payments we intend to continue to repurchase shares under our existing 10 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on july 10 2008 depending on credit market conditions macroeconomic factors and expectations regarding future cash flows 

capitalization 

shareholders equity was 129 billion or 2730 per share as of september 25 2009 compared to 155 billion or 3276 per share as of september 26 2008 shareholders equity decreased primarily due to a net loss of 18 billion which was primarily driven by goodwill and intangible asset impairments dividends declared of 472 million a 220 million current period change relating to the companys retirement plans and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 203 million 

total debt was 43 billion as of september 25 2009 and september 26 2008 respectively total debt as a percentage of capitalization total debt and shareholders equity was 25 as of september 25 2009 and 22 as of september 26 2008 respectively 

our cash balance increased to 24 billion as of september 25 2009 as compared to 15 billion as of september 26 2008 this increase in cash was primarily due to cash generated by the operating segments as well as proceeds from issuance of longterm debt 

debt tenders 

in connection with the settlement of litigation arising from the separation related to our public debt on june 3 2008 we along with our finance subsidiary tifsa a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and successor company to tyco international group sa tigsa a whollyowned subsidiary of the company organized under the laws of luxembourg consummated consent solicitations and exchange offers related to certain series of debt issued under our 1998 and 2003 indentures in connection with the exchange offers we issued 422 million principal amount of 70 notes due 2019 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 70 notes due 2028 and 707 million principal amount of 6875 notes due 2021 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 6875 notes due 2029 in connection with the consent solicitations holders of our 60 notes due 2013 6125 notes due 2008 6125 notes due 2009 675 notes due 2011 6375 notes due 2011 70 notes due 2028 and 6875 notes due 2029 collectively received consent payments totaling 250 million 

the terms of the consent and exchange offers were evaluated as a debt modification in accordance with the authoritative guidance for debtors accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments and it was determined that the 70 notes due 2028 and the 6875 notes due 2029 were extinguished because the cash flows of the new bonds as compared to the original bonds were substantially modified as a result the new bonds and the 70 notes due 2028 and the 6875 notes due 2029 that were not tendered for exchange were recorded at their fair value upon completion of the exchange offers in determining fair value we measured the bonds as if they were an initial issuance to the public this was done by obtaining effective yield data derived from comparable pricing received from the issuance of bonds with similar ratings and covenants by large public companies 

during the year ended september 26 2008 in connection with the consent solicitations and exchange offers we recorded a 222 million charge to other expense net as a loss on extinguishment of debt this charge was comprised of the consent payments related to the extinguished bonds notes due 2028 and 2029 premium on the exchanged bonds which represents the difference between the fair value and the book value of the extinguished bonds and the writeoff of the original unamortized debt issuance costs as well as fees paid to thirdparties associated with the bonds that were not deemed extinguished the remaining portion of the consent payment and issuance costs will be amortized over the remaining life of the bonds 

during the year ended september 28 2007 we recorded a 259 million charge to other expense net for the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the debt tender offers in connection with the separation 

bank and revolving credit facilities 

on june 24 2008 tyco and tifsa entered into a 500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with citibank na as administrative agent for the lenders party thereto this credit agreement has a threeyear term borrowings under this agreement have a variable interest rate based on libor or an alternate base rate the margin over libor can vary based on changes in our credit rating and facility utilization together with our 119 billion fiveyear senior revolving credit agreement dated as of april 25 2007 our total committed revolving credit line was 169 billion as of september 25 2009 these revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital capital expenditures and other corporate purposes as of september 25 2009 there were no amounts drawn under these facilities although we had dedicated 200 million of availability to backstop outstanding commercial paper as discussed above we believe that all of the lenders under our revolving credit facility are capable of meeting any borrowing requests tifsa may make 

tifsas bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property our indentures contain 

customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business

guarantees 

certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of thirdparties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2009 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees if required would not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

there are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among tyco covidien and tyco electronics in accordance with the terms of the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement the guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the tax sharing agreement at the time of the separation we recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications in the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees we determined the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications utilizing expected present value measurement techniques significant assumptions utilized to determine fair value included determining a range of potential outcomes assigning a probability weighting to each potential outcome and estimating the anticipated timing of resolution the probability weighted outcomes were discounted using our incremental borrowing rate the liability necessary to reflect the fair value of the guarantees and indemnifications under the tax sharing agreement is 554 million which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of september 25 2009 and september 26 2008 the guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the tax sharing agreement see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax sharing agreement 

in addition we historically provided support in the form of financial andor performance guarantees to various covidien and tyco electronics operating entities in connection with the separation we worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to covidien or tyco electronics to the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the separation date we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support the estimated fair value of these obligations is 4 million and 7 million which are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of september 25 2009 and september 26 2008 respectively with an offset to shareholders equity on the separation date 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including for example unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities see item 1 business—environmental matters and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows

accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements —in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance which established the fasb standards accounting codification codification as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants the codification supersedes all the existing nonsec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and subsequently the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts the guidance is not intended to change or alter existing gaap the guidance became effective for tyco in the fourth quarter of 2009 the guidance did not have an impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows all references to previous numbering of fasb statements fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts have been removed from the financial statements and accompanying footnotes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of conducting business we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices accordingly we have established a comprehensive risk 

management process to monitor evaluate and manage the principal exposures we believe we are subject to we seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may from time to time include forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency options interest rate swaps and forward commodity contracts derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated nonfunctional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so 

we do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes further to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an aa3 longterm debt rating these counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party 

foreign currency exposures 

we hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts during 2009 our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the swiss franc british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar the market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts excluding the dividend hedge contract discussed below is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on september 25 2009 a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 6 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a 7 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 

effective march 17 2009 tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from bermuda to switzerland until january 1 2011 tyco intends to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction of capital denominated in swiss francs however the company expects to actually pay dividends in us dollars based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the us dollar amount required to be paid the company manages the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the swiss franc would result in a 20 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the swiss franc would result in a 24 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts however gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 

previously we hedged our investment in certain foreign operations in december 2006 due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the separation the company determined that it would no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be longterm investments as a result the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations subsequent to this determination rather than in the currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income within shareholders equity forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges 

during fiscal 2009 we designated certain intercompany loans as permanent in nature as of september 25 2009 30 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature and for the year ended september 25 2009 we recorded the cumulative translation loss through 

accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to these loans which had no material impact for fiscal 2009 and 141 million for fiscal 2008 

interest rate exposures 

our longterm debt portfolio primarily consists of fixedrate instruments the company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes during 2009 the company entered into the interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on 14 billion of fixedrate debt to variable rates in these contracts the company agreed with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount a 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of september 25 2009 would result in a 22 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts conversely a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of september 25 2009 would result in a 22 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts 

commodity exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may in limited circumstances enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures these exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program during 2009 the company did not hedge its exposure attributable to changes in commodity prices but may consider such strategies in the future 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under exchange act rule 13a15e based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that as of september 25 2009 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported as and when required 

we have made significant systems and process improvements in our tax accounting processes through fiscals 2008 and 2009 and in the fourth quarter of 2009 management conducted extensive assessments of the effectiveness of the tax accounting and control procedures after reviewing the results of these assessments management concluded that internal controls relating to accounting for income taxes are designed and operating effectively to prevent a material error from occurring or to assure that such an error would be detected and corrected in a timely manner 

there were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended september 25 2009 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect these internal controls 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined under exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 25 2009 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control— 

integrated framework  managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting management reviewed the results of its assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors based on our assessment and those criteria management believes that the company maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as of september 25 2009 

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis during 2007 managements procedures and testing identified errors that although not material to the consolidated financial statements led management to conclude that control deficiencies existed related to tax effecting consolidating entries analysis and reconciliation of taxes receivable and taxes payable in nonus jurisdictions certain aspects of deferred taxes and procedures with respect to classification of tax amounts in the consolidated balance sheets as a result of these deficiencies it was reasonably possible that internal controls over financial reporting may not have prevented or detected errors from occurring that could have been material either individually or in the aggregate management accordingly concluded that internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as a result of a material weakness related to certain aspects of accounting for income taxes as of september 28 2007 and september 26 2008 as of september 25 2009 the company has remediated the material weakness in income tax accounting as a result of corrective actions taken in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 

during fiscal years 2008 and 2009 we have focused on our internal controls over accounting for income taxes and have taken steps to strengthen controls in response to the identified material weakness significant internal control information systems and process improvements have been implemented in our tax accounting processes to enhance effectiveness and sustainability including 

• increased number of tax accounting resources • enhanced policies and procedures relating to tax account reconciliation and analysis • conducted extensive companywide training for all company personnel engaged in tax accounting activities • improved the level and quality of crosscompany communication and information flows regarding the tax accounting process and requirements • improved process for tax effecting consolidating entries and • enhanced monitoring of tax accounting submissions and tax account balances of our legal entities globally we made the above improvements through 2008 and 2009 and in the fourth quarter of 2009 management concluded that the improved controls had been operating for a sufficient period of time to allow the effectiveness of the remediation measures to be validated we conducted extensive assessments of the effectiveness of the remediated tax accounting and control procedures after reviewing the results of these assessments management concluded that internal controls relating to accounting for income taxes are designed and operating effectively to prevent a material error from occurring or to assure that such an error would be detected and corrected in a timely manner 

our internal control over financial reporting as of september 25 2009 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k and their report is also included in this form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as competition technological obsolescence labor relations general economic conditions geopolitical events and international operations additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and our liquidity 

risks relating to the proposed separation 

the cost to complete the transaction could be significant 

management estimates that the income statement charges to complete the proposed separation will be 12 billion to 16 billion aftertax however actual costs could exceed that estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to complete the transaction 

there is no guarantee that the proposed separation will be finalized completion of the proposed separation is subject to a number of factors and conditions including 

• changes in business political and economic conditions in the us and in other countries in which the company currently operates • changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of regulatory bodies • changes in operating performance of the company • required changes to existing financings and changes in credit ratings including those that may result from the proposed separation • the companys ability to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the proposed separation and • the companys ability to satisfy certain conditions precedent including final approval by the tyco board of directors receipt of certain tax rulings necessary opinions of counsel and the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the sec increased demands on our management team as a result of the proposed separation could distract managements attention from operating the business 

management expects to file registration statements in connection with the proposed separation during the second quarter of 2007 the complexity of the transaction will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources as well as the use of several crossfunctional project teams our business or results of operations may be adversely affected during the transition period 

each of the independent companies resulting from the completion of the proposed separation may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect will be achieved from the separation transactions 

each of the independent companies may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits we expect will result from the separation of two of tycos segments into independent companies or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all for example there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will regard the corporate structures of each of the independent companies as more clear and simple than the current tyco corporate structure or place a greater value on the sum of each of the independent companies as compared to tyco 

if certain internal restructuring transactions and the distribution relating to the proposed separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

we anticipate that certain internal restructuring transactions will be undertaken in preparation for the proposed separation these transactions are complex and could cause us to incur significant tax liabilities we have an initial private letter ruling regarding these transactions and the distribution from the irs noting that they qualify for favorable tax treatment we have also requested or may request supplemental rulings regarding these transactions and in addition we expect to obtain an opinion of tax counsel confirming the favorable tax treatment of these transactions the ruling and the opinion rely or will rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from us regarding the past and future conduct of our businesses and other matters if any of these are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied then we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal restructuring transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the distributions should become taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock ownership after the distribution 

risks relating to actions of tycos former senior corporate management 

pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

as a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management tyco some members of our former senior corporate management current and former members of our board of directors and our current chief executive officer former chief financial officer and current general counsel are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of certain disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws tyco certain of our current and former employees some members of our former senior corporate management and some former members of the board of directors of tyco international us inc also are named as defendants in several erisa class actions we are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are also named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by bermuda law in addition our insurance carriers may decline coverage or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability in some or all of these matters we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses in excess of any insurance coverage in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows at this time it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses if any that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters 

continued scrutiny resulting from ongoing governmental investigations may have an adverse effect on our business 

we and others have received subpoenas and requests from the sec the united states department of labor the general service administration and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance management operations accounting and related controls certain current and former employees in fire and security received subpoenas from the secs division of enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices regarding the adt dealer connect fees as previously reported in our periodic filings these practices have been discontinued the united states department of labor is investigating tyco and the administrators of certain of our benefit plans at this time we cannot predict when these investigations will be completed nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be it is possible that we will be required to pay material fines consent to injunctions on future conduct lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities which in turn could negatively impact our business 

with nongovernmental customers or suffer other penalties each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot provide assurance that the effects and results of these or other investigations will not be material and adverse to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

examinations and audits by tax authorities including the irs could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities in connection with such examinations tax authorities including the united states irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision equity or goodwill as appropriate the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 

the irs continues to audit the 1997 through 2000 years in 2004 the company submitted to the irs proposed adjustments to these prior period us federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed during 2006 the irs accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments also during 2006 the company developed proposed amendments to us federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002 on the basis of previously accepted amendments the company has determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and accordingly has recorded them in the consolidated financial statements such adjustments did not have a material impact on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company has yet to complete proposed amendments to its us federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2002 which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002 when the companys tax return positions are updated additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the consolidated financial statements while the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed the company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness 

we estimate that our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future in making this estimate we have not assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with our pending litigation or investigations any material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements arising from our pending investigations and litigation could require additional funding if such developments require us to obtain additional funding we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

such an outcome could have important consequences to you for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital 3 

expenditures research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes including debt reduction or dividend payments 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions • limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate • restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities • make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness and • increase the difficulty andor cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness additional negative publicity may adversely affect our business 

as a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management tyco was the subject of continuing negative publicity focusing on these actions this negative publicity contributed to significant declines in the prices of our publicly traded securities in 2002 and brought increased regulatory scrutiny upon us additional negative publicity related to former senior corporate managements actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our publicly traded securities 

our senior corporate management team is required to devote significant attention to matters arising from actions of prior management 

we replaced our senior corporate executives with a new team during 2002 through 2004 and all of the former members of our board of directors determined not to stand for reelection in march 2003 a new board of directors was elected at our annual general meeting of shareholders in march 2003 we cannot provide assurance that this major restructuring of our board of directors and senior management team and the accompanying distractions related to matters arising from the actions of prior management will not adversely affect our results of operations 

risks relating to our businesses 

cyclical industry and economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results in some of our segments are affected adversely by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which they operate for example demand for the products and services of fire and security and engineered products and services is significantly affected by levels of commercial construction and consumer and business discretionary spending also the electronic components business within electronics is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand patterns of these markets which could impact the margins in this business this cyclical impact can be amplified because some of our businesses purchase products from other of our businesses for example fire and security purchases certain products sold by engineered products and services therefore a drop in demand for our fire prevention products due to lower new residential or office construction or other factors can cause a drop in demand for certain of our products sold by engineered products and services 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and 4 

• the health and safety of our employees there can be no assurances that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

we have received notification from the united states environmental protection agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and or for natural resource damages we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations these projects relate to a variety of activities including 

• radioactive materials decontamination and decommissioning • solvent metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup and • oil spill equipment upgrades and replacement these projects involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us 

the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods based upon our experience current information and applicable laws we believe that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs including asset retirement obligations of 111 million of approximately 295 million of which 34 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 261 million is included in other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 

pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to periodically assess our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures the proposed separation plan and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges in addition such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders equity increasing our debttototalcapitalization ratio such reduction in consolidated net worth and increase in debt as a percentage of total capitalization could result in a default under our credit facilities 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates see part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our net revenue derived from sales in nonus markets for 2006 was 512 of our total net revenue and we expect revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations our financial statements reflect recalculations of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our functional currency 

we are a large buyer of steel in the united states we are also a large buyer of other commodities including resin copper brass gold paper pulp and cotton volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program in some cases we purchase hedges or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations nevertheless changes in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are named as a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in the ordinary course of business we are named as a defendant in a significant amount of litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights litigation alleging anticompetitive behavior and product liability litigation in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages in addition our healthcare business is subject to regulation and potential litigation the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our healthcare business is subject to extensive regulation by the government and failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the united states food and drug administration regulates the approval manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products failure to comply with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead and have led to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls withdrawals or declining sales 

our adt business may experience higher rates of customer attrition which may reduce our future revenue and has caused us to change the useful life of accounts increasing our depreciation and amortization expense 

attrition rates for customers in our worldwide electronic security services business were 138 148 and 151 on a trailing 12month basis as of september 29 2006 september 30 2005 and 2004 respectively although the attrition rate has been declining if attrition rates were to trend upward adts recurring revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected tyco amortizes the costs of adts contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the adt dealer program based on the estimated life of the customer relationships internally generated residential and commercial account pools are similarly amortized if the attrition rates were to rise tyco may be required to accelerate the amortization of the costs which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees or agents or those of our subsidiaries 

tyco and its subsidiaries operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree including but not limited to asia india latin america and europe tycos policy mandates strict compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act as amended and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees that would violate us andor foreign laws including the laws governing payments to government officials such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits or other monies against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and therefore our ability to do business 

from time to time tyco obtains or receives information alleging improper conduct of tyco employees agents andor distributors including conduct involving potentially improper payments to foreign government officials tycos policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted taking remedial control measures and reporting its findings to relevant law enforcement authorities 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization minimum levels of net worth and limits on incurrence of liens our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges subsidiary debt and saleleaseback transactions 

although we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations see liquidity and capital resources—capitalization 

downgrades of our debt ratings would adversely affect us 

certain downgrades by moodys and sp may increase our cost of capital and make it more difficult for us to obtain new financing 

we have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our accounting for income taxes which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis 

in connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our accounting for income taxes as of september 29 2006 for a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness see managements report on internal control over financial reporting as revised under item 9a controls and procedures 

a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information while we have taken measures to strengthen our internal controls in response to the identified material weakness related to certain aspects of accounting for income taxes additional work remains to be done to address the identified material weakness if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could be subject to among other things regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec and the new york stock exchange including a delisting from the new york stock exchange securities litigation debt rating agency downgrades or rating withdrawals any one of which could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and could adversely affect our business prospects 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation 

legislation and negative publicity regarding bermuda companies could increase our tax burden and affect our operating results 

legislation relating to government contracts 

we continue to assess the potential impact of various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny government contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad the legislative proposals could cover the 1997 acquisition of tyco international ltd a massachusetts corporation by adt limited a public company that had been located in bermuda since the 1980s with origins dating back to the united kingdom since the early 1900s as a result of which adt changed its name to tyco international ltd and became the parent to the tyco group 

in addition the us federal government and various other states and municipalities have proposed or may propose legislation that would deny government contracts to us companies that move their corporate location abroad we are unable to predict with any level of certainty the likelihood or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the financial impact such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business 

tax legislation 

the united states congress has in the past considered legislation affecting the tax treatment of us companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions in october 2004 the united states congress enacted such legislation which did not however retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of tyco international ltd by adt limited legislation passed by the us senate on 

november 18 2005 would modify parts of the american jobs creation act of 2004 but would not retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of tyco international ltd by adt limited we expect various us treasury department studies to be released and tax proposals to be introduced in the united states congress in the future and cannot provide assurance that these proposals would not have adverse effects on tyco if enacted such adverse effects could include substantially reducing the tax benefits of our corporate structure materially increasing our tax burden or otherwise adversely affecting our business 

negative publicity 

there is continuing negative publicity regarding and criticism of us companies use of or relocation to offshore jurisdictions including bermuda as a bermuda company this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of the negative public image of bermuda companies or the possibility of our customers receiving negative media attention from doing business with a bermuda company 

bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

we are organized under the laws of bermuda it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in bermuda based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda 

as a bermuda company tyco is governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions shareholder lawsuits and indemnification likewise the duties of directors and officers of a bermuda company are generally owed to the company only shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may only exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company in limited circumstances under bermuda law a company may also agree to indemnify directors and officers for any personal liability not involving fraud or dishonesty incurred in relation to the company thus holders of tyco securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states

restatement—reviews of prior period stock option grant practices and equity plan compliance 

review of prior period stock option grant practices 

as previously reported in our form 10k for 2006 filed on december 11 2006 following publicity in 2006 regarding the granting of stock options at a number of companies the company initiated an internal review of its historical stock option grant practices to determine whether the companys stock option award actions were appropriately governed and were accurately reflected in the companys financial statements the companys internal audit staff which reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors began a review of the companys equity incentive plan practices and associated approvals over the period october 1999 through june 2006 in addition to its review of plan administration the internal audit staff performed detailed audit procedures on more than 95 of share options granted through the regular and offcycle grants during this period the audit procedures covered 100 of named executive officers and section 16 officers and directors the companys review included an evaluation of grant authorizations an assessment of the appropriate measurement dates under accounting principles board apb opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to employees  and the application of appropriate equity pricing methodology 

the company has determined that between october 1999 and 2002 there were several grants for which complete documentation was not available as such validation of the appropriate measurement date under apb opinion no 25 was difficult to determine with precision for such grants the company determined an appropriate measurement date in reliance upon all available evidence and consideration of alternatives including the communication date to grantees for all grants to establish a reasonable date upon which equity recipients and share awards were known fixed and ready to be communicated to employees to the extent the company was able to conclude that grant date lists were fixed and ready to be communicated to employees the measurement date was considered to be the grant date however in many instances the measurement date the company used was the date that the equity award was communicated to the recipient 

the company has concluded that errors relating to the companys stock option accounting primarily resulted from a incomplete documentation to enable application of accounting principles under apb opinion no 25 b the unintentional misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles and c the absence of adequate control procedures in 1999 through early 2002 designed to ensure equity recipients and share awards were fixed and certain prior to the legal grant date 

the amount of aggregate compensation expense related to this item which the company should have recorded in prior periods is 252 million pretax and 173 million aftertax relating to grants awarded prior to the end of 2002 none of this amount relates to 2006 17 million pretax 8 million aftertax relates to 2005 and 66 million pretax 46 million aftertax relates to 2004 as awards vested over the relevant vesting periods had the company used the communication date as the measurement date in all instances the difference in the amount recorded would not have been material to any period or in the aggregate 

review of equity plan compliance 

separately the company identified an error related to the recognition of compensation expense under the companys employee stock purchase program in the united kingdom the aggregate compensation expense related to this item which the company should have recorded in 20022005 is 29 million pretax and 20 million aftertax none of this amount relates to 2006 7 million pretax 5 million aftertax relates to 2005 and 19 million pretax 13 million aftertax relates to 2004 

effect of restatement 

taken together the stock option and equity plan prior period errors result in an aggregate understatement of compensation expense of 281 million pretax and 193 million aftertax based on the findings of the items discussed above the company has restated its reported results for prior 

periods to reflect the impact of additional stockbased compensation expense in corporate the impact by year and in total is as follows  in millions

overview 

as previously reported in our periodic filings on january 13 2006 the company announced that its board of directors approved a plan to separate the company into three separate publicly traded companies—tyco healthcare one of the worlds leading diversified healthcare companies tyco electronics the worlds largest passive electronic components manufacturer and a combination of tyco fire and security and engineered products and services a global business with leading positions in residential and commercial security fire protection and industrial products and services the proposed separation after thorough reviews of strategic options with our board of directors we believe that this strategy is the best way to position our marketleading companies for sustained growth and value creation 

following the proposed separation tycos shareholders will own 100 of the equity in all three companies through taxfree stock dividends each company will have its own independent board of directors and strong corporate governance standards we expect to file registration statements in connection with the proposed separation during the second quarter of 2007 

we expect to incur separation costs related to debt refinancing tax restructuring professional services and employeerelated costs we currently estimate that the income statement charges will be at the high end of the range of 12 billion to 16 billion aftertax the total charges to complete the proposed separation will be influenced by the manner in which and the conditions under which we execute the tax restructuring and debt refinancing transactions during 2006 the company incurred 169 million of costs related to the proposed separation primarily related to legal accounting and consulting work associated with executing the transaction 

consummation of the proposed separation is subject to certain conditions including final approval by the tyco board of directors receipt of certain tax rulings necessary opinions of counsel the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the securities and exchange commission sec and the completion of any necessary debt refinancings approval by the companys shareholders is not required as a condition to the consummation of the proposed separation tyco has received an initial private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the proposed separation noting it will qualify for favorable tax treatment 

we are focused on growing profitability within each of these companies before and after the proposed separation so that each may be well positioned for longterm growth as independent entities following the proposed separation we expect that all three companies will be dividendpaying companies as we prepare for the proposed separation we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders during 2006 we repurchased 95 million of our common shares for 25 billion under our share repurchase programs we completed the 15 billion share repurchase program previously approved by the board of directors with the repurchase of 45 million of our common shares for 12 billion and we repurchased an additional 50 million of our common shares for 13 billion under the new 20 billion share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in may 2006 we have 659 million remaining on the 20 billion share repurchase program which we expect to complete prior to the proposed separation 

during 2006 holders of tyco international group sa a whollyowned subsidiary of the company organized under the laws of luxembourg tigsa series a 275 convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option converted 12 billion of these debentures into 54 million tyco common shares and redeemed the remaining 1 million principal amount outstanding with cash additionally we utilized 10 billion in cash for a scheduled repayment of public notes and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities for a total cash payment of 203 million reducing principal debt and minority interest by 191 million and 10 million respectively in october 2006 we exercised our right to buy five cable laying sea vessels that were previously included under an offbalance sheet leasing arrangement for 280 million 

during the first quarter of 2007 the operations of aguas industriales de jose ca aij a majority owned engineered products and services segment joint venture in venezuela met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was sold as such it has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented 

during 2006 we completed the sale of our plastics and adhesives segment our plastics adhesives and ludlow coated products businesses were sold for net proceeds of 882 million and the ae products group was sold for net proceeds of 2 million during 2006 the company also recorded a 30 million receivable due from the purchaser of the plastics adhesives and ludlow coated products businesses based on the decline of average resin prices during fiscal year 2006 as contemplated in the definitive sale agreement this amount is payable to tyco no later than january 2007 additionally we entered into a definitive agreement to sell printed circuit group pcg a tyco electronics business and leading manufacturer of hightechnology printed circuit boards for the military aerospace and commercial markets for 226 million this transaction was completed on october 27 2006 and a gain on sale of approximately 45 million is expected as such the operations of our plastics and adhesives segment pcg business and aij business are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented details related to the companys divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed in discontinued operations and divestitures we are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term vision 

to further improve operating efficiency during the first quarter of 2007 we have launched a restructuring program across all segments including the corporate organization which will streamline some of the businesses and reduce our operational footprint we expect to incur charges of approximately 600 million over the next two years of which 500 million is expected to be incurred in 2007 we expect that the total cash expenditures for this program will be approximately 450 million of which 250 million is expected in 2007 we believe this restructuring program will strengthen our competitive position over the long term

net revenue for fire and security increased 150 million or 13 in 2006 as compared to 2005 including a 24 increase in product revenue revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security fire protection and other systems net revenue increased due to growth in worldwide fire protection contracting and services primarily related to electrical and mechanical contracting as well as growth in the north american and international markets in our worldwide electronic security services these increases were offset by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 117 million unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 60 million and a decrease in sales of breathing and fire detection products within safety products 

operating income decreased 26 million in 2006 over the prior year primarily as a result of lower margins increased investments in selling and marketing and a decline in european recurring monitoring revenues within worldwide electronic security services results for the current period included net restructuring impairment and divestiture charges of 11 million as compared to net restructuring impairment and divestiture charges of 28 million in 2005 operating income for 2006 was favorably impacted by cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs in addition 2006 operating income was unfavorably impacted by 2 million 

related to the proposed separation as well as incremental stock option charges of 35 million required under sfas no 123r 

attrition rates for customers in our worldwide electronic security services business decreased to 138 on a trailing twelvemonth basis for 2006 as compared to 148 for 2005 and 151 in 2004 

net revenue for fire and security remained relatively level during 2005 as compared to 2004 as the decrease in product revenue was offset by an increase in service revenue revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security fire protection and other systems net revenue increased due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 274 million and to a lesser extent increased sales volume of breathing and intrusion products at tyco safety products as well as growth in our european fire services business these increases were offset by the impact of divestitures of 315 million and decreased sales at our security business in europe

healthcare 

net revenue operating income and operating margin for healthcare for the years ended september 29 2006 september 30 2005 and 2004 were as follows  in millions 



net revenue for healthcare increased 98 million or 10 in 2006 as compared to 2005 this increase was largely driven by the international and surgical divisions within medical devices  supplies as a result of strong growth across the majority of geographic regions in surgical sales including laparoscopy ablation and vessel sealing and to a lesser extent sutures also contributing to the revenue increase was volume growth in bulk pharmaceuticals active pharmaceutical ingredients and retail with growth primarily driven by new product sales and distribution growth in latin america as well as favorable economic trends and strategic promotional efforts in key markets these increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of voluntary product recalls in imaging and lower volume sales within respiratory in addition to the negative changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 93 million 

operating income and operating margin decreased 86 million and 12 percentage points respectively as compared to 2005 the increased volume in medical devices  supplies discussed above was more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing performance primarily in respiratory and imaging as a result of lower volumes and higher expenses primarily associated with voluntary product recalls as well as weakness in retail of 40 million also contributing to the decrease in operating income although to a lesser extent was additional investments in research and development and selling expenses operating income was adversely impacted by a charge of 63 million related to purchased inprocess research and development incremental stock option charges required under sfas no 123r of 37 million 2 million of charges related to the proposed separation and a 31 million negative 

impact related to foreign currency exchange rates additionally operating income for 2006 included a gain on divestiture of 48 million primarily relating to a sale of a business within medical devices and supplies 

net revenue for healthcare increased 433 million or 48 in 2005 as compared to 2004 this increase resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses and to a lesser extent favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 141 million growth in healthcares underlying businesses was principally driven by increased revenue within medical devices  supplies which was largely the result of increased sales volume in the international division primarily in europe due to a sales force investment and sales growth in vessel sealing laparoscopy and stapling increased sales at the surgical division within medical devices  supplies also strongly contributed due to enhanced contracting with group purchasing organizations increased acceptance of laparoscopic gastric bypass procedures and increased adoption of ligasure device pharmaceuticals also contributed to the increase in revenue although to a lesser extent these increases were partially offset by decreased sales in retail primarily due to a difficult competitive environment and customer consolidations 

the decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to a 277 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 associated with the adverse decision by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit on a previously disclosed legal matter refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion this charge combined with declines in the retail division as a result of the competitive environment mentioned above as well as increased material and transportation costs was offset by substantial increases from other divisions specifically the international and surgical divisions within medical devices  supplies as well as within pharmaceutical increases in these divisions were due to strong sales growth as mentioned above combined with a favorable product mix also positively impacting the segment were reduced administrative expenses at the segment level as well as favorable foreign exchange rates of 41 million 

engineered products and services 

net revenue operating income and operating margin for engineered products and services for the years ended september 29 2006 september 30 2005 and 2004 were as follows  in millions 



net revenue for engineered products and services increased 486 million or 76 in 2006 as compared to 2005 the increase in net revenue was largely driven by flow control as a result of strong project volume in the pacific region and favorable market conditions in asia and north america as well as increased selling prices in electrical  metal products due to higher costs of copper to a lesser extent tyco fire  building products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets and increased price realization the above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at infrastructure services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects which has resulted in fewer but more profitable projects and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 25 million 

operating income remained relatively level in 2006 as compared to 2005 both the revenue growth at flow control and fire  building products as well as favorable copper spreads in electrical  

metal products and higher margin projects at infrastructure services contributed positively to operating income in 2006 offsetting this growth was a 100 million charge relating to the voluntary replacement program for certain sprinkler heads see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and incremental stock option charges of 17 million required under sfas no 123r 

net revenue for engineered products and services increased 448 million or 75 in 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased selling prices in electrical  metal products due to higher costs of steel and other raw materials in addition flow control and to a lesser extent tyco fire  building products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 167 million also contributed to the increase in revenue the above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at infrastructure services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects which has resulted in fewer but more profitable projects 

the increases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to increased volume and demand within the industrial and commercial markets along with the impact of operational excellence initiatives cost reductions from prior period restructuring programs and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 21 million these increases more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs additionally 2005 operating income includes 4 million of net restructuring impairment and divestiture charges as compared to the 62 million of net restructuring impairment and divestiture charges in 2004 

corporate 

corporate net revenue was 29 million and 25 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively which related to the tgn business which was sold in the third quarter of 2005 corporate expense was 400 million 255 million and 482 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively corporate expense for 2006 includes 162 million related to the proposed separation and incremental stock option charges of 32 million required under sfas no 123r corporate expense also includes income related to a settlement with a former executive of 72 million as well as 48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience operating income for 2005 and 2004 has been restated to reflect additional compensation expense of 24 million and 85 million respectively related to the review of prior period stock option grant practices and equity plan compliance see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

corporate expense for 2005 includes a 301 million gain on the sale of the tgn business and tgn operating losses of 54 million in addition corporate expenses for 2005 included a 50 million charge representing the fines and penalties that the company paid to resolve the matters raised in the sec investigation that commenced in june 2002 as well as a 70 million charge for estimated legacy contingencies related to former executives employment

interest income and expense 

interest income was 133 million in 2006 as compared to 123 million and 91 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

interest expense was 709 million in 2006 as compared to 814 million in 2005 and 956 million in 2004 the decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily driven by lower debt balances partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program as compared to 2005 

the decrease in interest expense in 2005 over 2004 is primarily the result of lower debt balances partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program compared to 2004 the weightedaverage rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2006 2005 and 2004 were 59 56 and 52 respectively 

other expense net 

during 2006 other expense net consisted primarily of a loss relating to the writedown of certain investments to their net realizable value 

during 2005 other expense net included a loss on the retirement of debt the company repurchased 1241 million principal amount of its outstanding 275 convertible senior debentures for 1823 million and 750 million principal amount of its outstanding 3125 convertible senior debentures for 1147 million these repurchases resulted in a 1013 million loss on the retirement of debt including the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs 

also during 2005 other expense net included income of 109 million related to a courtordered restitution award on september 12 2002 indictments were filed in the supreme court of the state of new york against mr l dennis kozlowski our former chairman and chief executive officer and mr mark h swartz our former chief financial officer and director together the defendants alleging enterprise corruption fraud conspiracy grand larceny falsifying certain business records and other crimes on june 17 2005 a jury convicted the defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment on september 19 2005 the defendants were sentenced in new york state supreme court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years in prison and to make joint restitution to the company in the amount of 134 million resulting from the larceny convictions 

the restitution award is comprised of 109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as other expense net in prior years and 25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the defendants which had been and remains reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements as a receivable the defendants have filed a notice of appeal of the convictions the company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the likelihood of the defendants success upon appeal of the larceny convictions which if successful could result in a change to the restitution order and has concluded that receipt of the restitution award is probable the court ordered the restitution payment to be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing tyco has initiated the process of collecting the restitution payment owed subject to the pending appeal during october 2006 the company received payment of 38 million relating to the restitution and expects to receive the remaining amount in the second quarter of 2007 

during 2004 other expense net consisted primarily of a loss on the retirement of debt the company repurchased 303 million of its 72 notes due 2008 for cash of 341 million which resulted in a 38 million loss including the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs additionally the company repurchased 517 million of its outstanding 275 convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option the total purchase price paid was 750 million and the repurchase resulted in a 241 million loss on the retirement of debt including the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 189 249 and 278 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 was primarily the result of additional releases of deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of improved historical and projected profitability in certain jurisdictions the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is primarily the result of the release of valuation allowances benefits realized related to the tgn divestiture as well as the courtordered restitution award related to certain former executives for which there is no tax obligation and to a lesser extent increased profitability in operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates this 

decrease is partially offset by an increase in charges for which no tax benefit was available such as the loss on retirement of debt asset impairments and the estimated settlement of the sec enforcement action 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1696 million and 1832 million at september 29 2006 and september 30 2005 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities further management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 

the company and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities in connection with such examinations tax authorities including the united states internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments the company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded while the timing and ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain the company anticipates that certain of these matters could be resolved during 2007 

the irs continues to audit the 1997 through 2000 years in 2004 we submitted to the irs proposed adjustments to these prior period us federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed during 2006 the irs accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments also during 2006 we developed proposed amendments to us federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002 on the basis of previously accepted amendments we have determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and accordingly have recorded them in the consolidated financial statements such adjustments did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we have yet to complete proposed amendments to our us federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2002 which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002 when our tax return positions are updated additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the consolidated financial statements while the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

except for earnings that are currently distributed no additional provision has been made for us or nonus income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested the investments are essentially permanent in duration or the company 

has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings a liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed it is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

  depreciation and amortization method for security monitoring systems —tyco generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools internally generated residential systems internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the adt dealer program the determination of the depreciable lives of subscriber systems as defined below included in property plant and equipment and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in intangible assets are primarily based on historical attrition rates thirdparty lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset the realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates if the attrition rates were to rise tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization 

with respect to tycos depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises the costs of these systems are combined in separate pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers collectively subscriber systems and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years tyco concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straightline method of depreciation over a ten to fourteenyear period continues to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools 

tyco purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the adt dealer program the purchase price of these customer contracts is recorded as an intangible asset ie contracts and related customer relationships 

intangible assets arising from the adt dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the doubledeclining balance method based on a tenyear life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships converting to the straightline method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above 

attrition rates for customers in our worldwide electronic security services business were 138 148 and 151 on a trailing 12month basis for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  revenue recognition —contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems large security intruder systems undersea fiberoptic cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion the risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion which are subject to the 

uncertainties inherent in longterm contracts revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable if estimates are inaccurate there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated 

product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct indirect and other markets participants rebates are estimated based on sales terms historical experience and trend analysis 

  loss contingencies —accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

  income taxes —in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and international pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings if a change in a valuation allowance occurs which was established in connection with an acquisition such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial position 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if the tax 

liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition 

  goodwill and intangible assets —goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if a triggering event occurs in performing this assessment management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated 

we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units when testing for goodwill impairment the company follows the guidance prescribed in sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets first the company performs a step i goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment in doing so the company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss in the step ii goodwill impairment test the company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined the company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment these types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future 

there were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006 2005 and 2004 goodwill impairments included in loss from discontinued operations in 2005 totaled 162 million 

  longlived assets —assets held and used by the company including property plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk impairments to longlived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of longlived assets there is a risk that the carrying value of our longlived assets may be overstated or understated 

  pension and postretirement benefits —our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit 

obligations under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately 225 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately 20 million 

liquidity and capital resources

the provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory decreased from 232 million during the year ended september 30 2005 to 174 million for the current period this decrease was driven by 

improvements across all segments particularly due to improved accounts receivable aging an overall improved credit profile of the customer base and better collections consequently our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from 421 million at september 30 2005 to 336 million at september 29 2006 

cash flows from operating activities and other cash flow items by segment for the year ended september 29 2006 were as follows  in millions

capitalization 

shareholders equity was 354 billion or 1776 per share at september 29 2006 compared to 326 billion or 1619 per share at september 30 2005 this increase was due primarily to net income of 36 billion the exchange of convertible debt due 2018 of 12 billion and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 606 million these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common shares by a subsidiary of 25 billion as previously mentioned and dividends declared of 807 million

our cash balance decreased to 29 billion at september 29 2006 as compared to 32 billion at september 30 2005 the decrease in cash was primarily due to the repurchase of shares under the previouslyannounced programs and the scheduled debt repayments referred to above capital expenditures and to a lesser extent dividend payments the majority of these decreases were partially offset by cash flows from operations

asbestos matters 

tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials consistent with the national trend of increased asbestosrelated litigation the company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years the majority of these cases have been filed against subsidiaries in healthcare and engineered products and services a limited number of the cases allege premises liability based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property a majority of the cases involve product liability claims based principally on allegations of past distribution of heatresistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestoscontaining gaskets or packing each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants 

tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos furthermore in the companys experience a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts the company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims 

when appropriate the company settles claims however the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial as of september 29 2006 there were approximately 15500 asbestos liability cases pending against the company and its subsidiaries 

the company estimates its pending asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries the companys estimate of the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years the company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters while it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestosrelated proceedings the company believes that the final outcome of all 

known and anticipated future claims after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

the company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations acquisitions and dispositions the company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

backlog 

at september 29 2006 we had a backlog of unfilled orders of 137 billion compared to a backlog of 131 billion at september 30 2005 we expect that approximately 80 of our backlog at 

september 29 2006 will be filled during 2007 backlog by reportable industry segment at september 29 2006 and september 30 2005 is as follows  in millions 



within fire and security backlog increased primarily as a result of strong bookings in north america and europe backlog for fire and security includes recurring revenueinforce which represents twelve months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business the amount of recurring revenueinforce at september 29 2006 and september 30 2005 was 365 billion and 355 billion respectively backlog within engineered products and services increased primarily as a result of increased orders at flow control within electronics backlog increased as a result of increased bookings in most key end markets backlog in healthcare represents unfilled orders which in the nature of the business are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received we do not view backlog in healthcare to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

sale of accounts receivable 

tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who in turn purchased and received ownership and security interests in those receivables these transactions qualified as true sales the sale proceeds were less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold and the discount from the face amount was included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income such discount aggregated 18 million or 31 of the weightedaverage balance of the receivables outstanding during 2004 

during 2004 the company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by 929 million of which 812 million related to its corporate accounts receivable programs which were terminated in 2005 no amounts were utilized under these programs at september 30 2004 and through the date of termination the remaining reduction of 117 million related to certain of the companys international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a shortterm financing mechanism the aggregate amount outstanding under the companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was 75 million and 80 million at september 29 2006 and september 30 2005 respectively 

guarantees 

certain of the companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of thirdparties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2007 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses the company often provides representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including for example unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental 

contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition the company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions however the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities see item i business—environmental matters on form 10k filed december 11 2006 for a discussion of these liabilities 

the company had an offbalance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea vessels upon expiration of this lease in october 2006 a subsidiary of the company has the option to buy these vessels for approximately 280 million or return the vessels to the lessor and under a residual guarantee pay any shortfall in sales proceeds to the lessor from a third party in an amount not to exceed 235 million as of september 29 2006 the company expected this obligation to be 54 million which is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on an estimate of the fair value of the vessels performed by management with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation in october 2006 the company exercised its option to buy these vessels for 280 million see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements 

in the normal course of business the company is liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale for further information on estimated product warranty see notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements

accounting pronouncements 

  recently adopted accounting pronouncements —effective october 1 2005 tyco adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r  sharebased payment  which requires compensation costs related to sharebased transactions including employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value sfas no 123r revises sfas no 123 as amended  accounting for stockbased compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to employees  tyco adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application transition method under this method compensation cost is recognized for the unvested portion of sharebased payments granted prior to october 1 2005 and all sharebased payments granted subsequent to september 30 2005 over the related vesting period prior to october 1 2005 the company applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in apb opinion no 25 in accounting for employee stockbased compensation prior period results have not been restated due to the adoption of sfas no 123r the companys results from continuing operations for 2006 include incremental sharebased compensation expense totaling 161 million as such basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were impacted by 006 and 005 respectively in 2006 

on november 10 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 123r3  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of sharebased payment awards  the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stockbased compensation pursuant to sfas no 123r in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paidin capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stockbased compensation and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stockbased compensation awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 123r the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

the company adopted fasb interpretation fin no 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations—an interpretation of fasb statement no 143 during the fourth quarter of 2006 this interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity fin no 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation the interpretation requires that conditional asset retirement obligations along with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs be reported at their fair values upon adoption the company recognized a liability of 32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of 10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets the initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of 22 million pretax reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of fin no 47 been in effect at the time certain obligations relating to the handling and disposal of asbestos have not been recorded due to the fact that fair value cannot be reasonably estimated because the company does not have sufficient information about the range of time over which the obligation may be settled the undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized in the financial statements are approximately 8 million the company will continue to monitor such legal asset retirement obligations and recognize a liability in the period sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in order to manage the volatility relating to our more significant market risks we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts crosscurrency swaps foreign currency options and interest rate swaps we do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2007 in assessing the current and future risk related to movements in interest rates we terminated the interest rate and cross currency swaps in several tranches the aggregate notional value of the interest rate and cross currency swaps terminated during the fourth quarter of 2006 was 25 billion in october 2006 we terminated the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of 06 billion the settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of 55 million since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt the related 32 million loss adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt instruments 

in december 2006 due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the proposed separation the company determined that it will no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be longterm investments as a result the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments will be recorded in the income statement rather than to the currency translation component of shareholders equity forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments will continue to be used to manage this exposure but will no longer be designated as net investment hedges 

we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations intercompany crossborder transactions and anticipated nonfunctional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an aa2 longterm debt rating

 item 9a controls and procedures 

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange 

commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under exchange act rule 13a15e based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that as of september 29 2006 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to accounting for income taxes which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures 

we proactively identify opportunities for control improvements during the fourth quarter of 2006 the company initiated an internal review of its historical stock option grant practices to determine whether the companys stock option award actions were appropriately governed and were accurately reflected in the companys financial statements the review was conducted by our internal audit staff under the direct supervision of our audit committee the results of the internal audit review were subject to the same controls and quality reviews associated with their normal recurring activities and were reviewed regularly with the audit committee the review identified controls that were not properly designed in prior years and as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements resulted in a restatement of our 2000 through 2005 consolidated financial statements while the company had instituted a number of control improvements in recent years including the implementation of a grant nomination tool other procedural enhancements and periodic audit reviews by internal audit we consider the previously discussed special review performed by internal audit to be a further enhancement to our equitybased compensation controls 

we also have ongoing initiatives to standardize and upgrade various financial operating systems and eliminate many of the manual and redundant tasks previously performed under older systems or processes these changes will be implemented in stages over the next several years additionally in preparation for our previously announced separation into three separate publicly traded companies we are continuing to install the necessary controls to allow the two new entities to properly function as independent public companies we have also begun migrating certain processes applications and functions previously performed by us to these two entities we believe that these initiatives should further strengthen our internal control over financial reporting as well as automate a number of our processes and activities we believe that the necessary procedures are in place to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as these initiatives continue 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting as revised 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined under exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 29 2006 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting management reviewed the results of its assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors based on our assessment we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as a result of a material weakness related to certain aspects of accounting for income taxes as of september 29 2006 

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that material misstatements of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected over the past four years significant internal control informational systems and process improvements have been implemented in our tax accounting processes however we determined that control deficiencies existed related to a consolidating entries and computing taxes on a jurisdictional specific basis to allow for proper calculation analysis and reconciliation of taxes receivable taxes payable and related deferred taxes and b procedures with respect to classification of tax amounts in the consolidated balance sheet the control deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements in any period presented however the design and operation of procedural and monitoring controls may not have prevented or detected at the level of less than remote likelihood errors from occurring that could have been material either individually or in the aggregate 

our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 29 2006 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10ka as stated in their report which is included herein 

april 19 2007 

remediation plan 

considerable actions have been taken to improve internal controls over our accounting for income taxes and we will take further steps to strengthen controls including the following planned actions 

• enhance policies and procedures relating to tax account reconciliation and analysis • evaluate and augment tax accounting resources • further specify and communicate to information providers requirements for tax jurisdiction specific information and • further strengthen communication and information flows between the tax department and controllers group 58

in fiscal year 2006 approximately 40 of the company’s sales to these manufacturers originated in the us 43 originated in europe and 17 originated in other foreign markets because of the importance of new vehicle sales of major automotive manufacturers to its operations the company is affected by general business conditions in this industry sales to additional automakers in fiscal year 2006 that accounted for more than 5 of the company’s consolidated net sales included nissan motor co ltd and volkswagen ag the company is also a major supplier to toyota motor corporation through wholly owned facilities and unconsolidated joint ventures 

building efficiency 

the building efficiency business conducts certain of its operations through thousands of individual contracts that are either negotiated or awarded on a competitive basis key factors in the award of contracts include system and service quality price design reputation technology efficiency acoustics application engineering capability and construction management expertise competition for contracts includes many regional national and international controls providers larger competitors include honeywell international inc siemens building technologies an operating group of siemens ag carrier corporation a subsidiary of united technologies corporation the trane company a subsidiary of american standard companies inc rheem manufacturing company lennox international inc and goodman global inc the services market is highly fragmented with no one company being dominant sales of these services are largely dependent upon numerous individual contracts with commercial businesses worldwide the loss of any individual contract would not have a material adverse effect on the company 

automotive experience 

the automotive experience business faces competition from other automotive suppliers and with respect to certain products from the automobile manufacturers who produce or have the capability to produce certain products the business supplies competition is based on technology quality reliability of delivery and price design engineering and product planning are increasingly important factors independent suppliers that represent the principal automotive experience competitors include lear corporation faurecia sa and magna automotive inc

backlog 

at september 30 2006 the company’s automotive experience backlog of net new incremental business to be executed within the next three fiscal years was approximately 35 billion 10 billion of which relates to fiscal year 2007 the backlog as of september 30 2005 was approximately 33 billion 12 billion which related to fiscal year 2006 the decrease in the subsequent year backlog is primarily due to lower vehicle production volumes in north america the automotive backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and uncertainties such as related vehicle production volumes the timing of related production launches and changes in customer development plans 

the company’s backlog relating to the building efficiency business is applicable to its sales of systems and services at september 30 2006 the backlog was 37 billion compared with 19 billion for the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of york the preceding data does not include amounts associated with facility management service contracts because such contracts are typically multiyear service awards the backlog amount outstanding at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the coming fiscal year period 

raw materials 

raw materials used by the businesses in connection with their operations including steel urethane chemicals lead copper sulfuric acid and polypropylene were readily available during the year and such availability is expected to continue except for volatility in lead prices the company expects other key commodity costs such as copper steel foam chemicals resin and fuel to be stable in fiscal year 2007 with the possibility of some softening during the year 

intellectual property 

generally the company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by contracts licenses confidentiality or other agreements 

the company owns numerous us and foreign patents and their respective counterparts the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products while the company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset no single patent or group of patents is critical to the success of the business the company from time to time grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others 

the company’s trademarks certain of which are material to its business are registered or otherwise legally protected in the us and many foreign countries throughout the world in which products and services of the company are sold the company from time to time becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions 

most works of authorship produced for the company such as computer programs catalogs and sales literature carry appropriate notices indicating the company’s claim to copyright protection under us law and appropriate international treaties 

environmental health and safety matters 

laws addressing the protection of the environment environmental laws and workers’ safety and health worker safety laws govern the company’s ongoing global operations they generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where companyrelated materials have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the company’s businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances 

the company’s operations and facilities have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with such laws or for the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved by negotiation with regulatory authorities that result in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor such penalties have been material see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for a discussion of the company’s potential environmental liabilities 

environmental capital expenditures 

the company’s ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures however expenditures in fiscal year 2006 related solely to environmental compliance were not material it is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year 

employees 

as of september 30 2006 the company employed approximately 136000 employees of whom approximately 75000 were hourly and 61000 were salaried 

seasonal factors 

sales of automotive seating  interior systems and batteries to automobile manufacturers for use as original equipment are dependent upon the demand for new automobiles management believes that demand for new automobiles generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions with no material seasonal effect the automotive replacement battery market is affected by weather patterns because batteries are more likely to fail when extremely low temperatures place substantial additional power requirements upon a vehicle’s electrical system also battery life is shortened by extremely high temperatures which accelerate corrosion rates therefore either mild winter or moderate summer temperatures may adversely affect automotive replacement battery sales certain of building efficiency’s sales are seasonal as the demand for residential air conditioning equipment generally increases in the summer months while the demand for furnaces peaks during the autumn months this seasonality is mitigated by the other products and services provided by the building efficiency business which have no material seasonal effect

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks 

we are subject to pricing pressure from our larger customers 

we face significant competitive pressures in all of our business segments because of their purchasing size our larger customers can influence market participants to compete on price terms if we are not able to offset pricing reductions resulting from these pressures by improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures those pricing reductions may have an adverse impact on our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of countries outside the us some of which are located in emerging markets the persistence of longterm economic uncertainty in some of the regions of the world in which we operate 

such as asia south america the middle east and other emerging markets could result in the disruption of markets and negatively affect the adequacy of cash flows from our operations to cover our capital needs and debt service 

in addition as a result of our global presence a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars we are therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure our primary exposures are to the euro british pound mexican peso canadian dollar czech koruna slovak koruna and japanese yen while we employ financial instruments to hedge transactional and foreign exchange exposure these activities do not insulate us completely from those exposures 

there are other risks that are inherent in our nonus operations including the potential for changes in socioeconomic conditions laws and regulations including import export labor and environmental laws and monetary and fiscal policies protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against american interests 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our nonus operations and therefore on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to regulation of our international operations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to foreign government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a foreign government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws which are complex and often times difficult to interpret and apply may result in severe criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations as disclosed in previous filings with the securities and exchange commission we have learned that york engaged in conduct that may lead to enforcement actions against us under applicable us trade and similar laws which give authorities the right to pursue administrative civil and criminal sanctions including monetary penalties 

we are subject to costly requirements relating to environmental regulation and environmental remediation matters which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

at september 30 2006 we recorded a liability of 34 million relating to environmental matters because of the uncertainties associated with environmental regulation and environmental remediation activities at sites where we may be potentially liable future expenses to remediate identified sites could be considerably higher than the accrued liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

additionally we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and foreign jurisdictions because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers intellectual property matters and employment claims there exists the possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our results of operations that is greater than we anticipate 

an increase in our level of indebtedness could lead to a downgrade in the ratings of our debt and in turn restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets 

our access to the debt capital markets may ultimately be impacted by changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future to the extent that we finance future acquisitions with debt for example may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt if ratings for our debt fell below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted 

additionally several of our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded consequently an increase in the level of our indebtedness may result in an increase in our interest expense further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 

we may be unable to complete or integrate acquisitions effectively which may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 

we intend to grow through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses to date a material portion of our growth has come through acquisitions we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets additionally we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions these and other acquisitionrelated factors may negatively and adversely impact our growth profitability and results of operations 

automotive experience risks 

decreased demand from our customers in the automotive industry may adversely affect our results of operations 

in fiscal year 2006 our three largest customers were automobile manufacturers general motors corporation daimlerchrysler ag and ford motor company the big 3 with sales to these customers representing approximately 32 of total company net sales sales to the big 3 originating in the us represented approximately 13 of our total net sales in fiscal year 2006 our financial performance depends in part on conditions in the automotive industry the big 3 have experienced declining market shares in north america and have recently announced significant restructuring actions in an effort to improve profitability the north american automotive manufacturers are also burdened with substantial structural costs such as pension and healthcare costs that have impacted their profitability and labor relations and may ultimately result in severe financial difficulty including bankruptcy if our customers especially the big 3 reduce their orders to us our results of operations would be adversely impacted additionally we have significant component production for manufacturers of motor vehicles in the us europe south america japan and other asiapacific rim countries continued uncertainty relating to the financial condition of the big 3 and others in the automotive industry may have a negative impact on our business 

the financial distress of our suppliers could harm our results of operations 

our supplier base has been adversely affected by industry conditions lower production levels for our key customers and increases in certain raw material commodity and energy costs have resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base several large suppliers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operations the continuation of financial distress within the supplier base may lead to increased commercial disputes and possible supply chain interruptions in addition the adverse industry environment has required us to provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to ensure uninterrupted production the continuation or worsening of these industry conditions may have a negative impact on our business 

change in consumer demand may adversely affect our results of operations 

recent and any future increases in energy costs that consumers incur could result in shifts in consumer demand away from motor vehicles that typically have higher amounts of content that we supply such as light trucks crossover vehicles minivans and suvs to smaller vehicles that have lower amounts of content that we supply the loss of business with respect to or a lack of commercial success of one or more particular vehicle models for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully negotiate pricing terms with our customers in the automotive experience business which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we negotiate sales prices annually with our automotive seating and interiors customers costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers generally result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require reductions in component pricing over the period of production pricing pressures may further intensify particularly in north america as domestic automotive manufacturers pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives to better compete with their foreign competitors if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our results of operations may be adversely affected 

increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 

commodity prices have risen rapidly in the past three years in our two largest markets north america and europe the cost of commodities primarily steel resin and chemicals increased net of recoveries through price increases to customers if commodity prices continue to rise and if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers then such increases may have an adverse affect on our results of operations 

the cyclicality of original equipment automobile production rates may adversely affect the results of operations in our automotive experience and power solutions businesses 

our automotive experience business and to a lesser extent our power solutions business are directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors including consumer spending and preferences any significant economic decline that results in a reduction in automotive production and sales by our automotive experience and power solutions customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

a variety of factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our automotive experience business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our automotive experience business the loss of or changes in automobile seating and interiors supply contracts or sourcing strategies with our major customers or suppliers inability to meet minimum vendor volume requirements startup expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellations of such programs underutilization of our manufacturing facilities each of which is generally located near and devoted to a particular customer’s facility inability to recover engineering and tooling costs market and financial consequences of any recalls that may be required on products that we have supplied delays or difficulties in new product development the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies global overcapacity and vehicle platform proliferation 

power solutions risks 

we face increasing competition and pricing pressure from other companies in the power solutions business 

the power solutions business competes with a number of major domestic and international manufacturers and distributors of leadacid batteries as well as a large number of smaller regional competitors the north american european and asian leadacid battery markets are highly competitive the manufacturers in these markets compete on price quality technical innovation service and warranty if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain market share in the regions and markets we serve our results of operations may be adversely affected 

a variety of factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our power solutions business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our power solutions business loss of or changes in automobile battery supply contracts with our large original equipment and aftermarket customers the increasing quality and useful life of batteries or use of alternative battery technologies both of which may contribute to a growth slowdown in the leadacid battery market delays or cancellations of new vehicle programs market and financial consequences of any recalls that may be required on our products delays or difficulties in new product development including nickelmetalhydridelithiumion technology financial instability or market declines of our customers or suppliers the increasing global environmental regulation related to the manufacture of leadacid batteries factors adversely affecting the supply and availability of raw materials primarily lead and polyplastics necessary for production and rapid increases and volatility of commodity prices particularly with respect to lead resin and fuel 

building efficiency risks 

our building efficiency business relies to a great extent on contracts and business with government entities the loss of which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our building efficiency business contracts with government entities and is subject to specific rules regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors we are subject to routine audits by the federal defense contract audit agency to assure our compliance with these requirements our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract terminations suspension or debarment from contracting with the us federal government civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution in addition sales to government entities may be affected by changes in procurement policies budget considerations unexpected us developments such as terrorist attacks or similar political developments or events abroad that may change the us federal government’s national security defense posture 

a variety of factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our building efficiency business 

any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our building efficiency business loss of or changes in building automation or facility management supply contracts with our major customers delays or difficulties in new product development the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies financial instability or market declines of our major or component suppliers the unavailability of raw materials primarily steel copper and electronic components necessary for production of hvac equipment rapid increases and volatility of commodity prices unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world a significant decline in the construction of new commercial buildings requiring interior control systems changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their interior control systems increased energy efficiency legislation requirements worldwide and a decline in the outsourcing of facility management services 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

the company has received no written comments regarding its periodic or current reports from the staff of the sec that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2006 that remain unresolved 




 item 2 properties 

at september 30 2006 the company conducted its operations in 52 countries throughout the world with its world headquarters located in milwaukee wisconsin the company’s wholly and majorityowned facilities which are listed in the table on the following pages by business and location totaled approximately 92 million square feet of floor space and are owned by the company except as noted the facilities primarily consisted of manufacturing assembly andor warehouse space the company considers its facilities to be suitable and adequate the majority of the facilities are operating at normal levels based on capacity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 in addition to the above listing which identifies large properties greater than 25000 square feet there are approximately 390 building efficiency branch offices and other administrative offices located in major cities throughout the world these offices vary in size in proportion to the volume of business in the particular locality 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as noted in item 1 liabilities potentially arise globally under various environmental laws and worker safety laws for activities that are not in compliance with such laws and for the cleanup of sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

currently the company is responding to allegations that it is responsible for performing environmental remediation or for the repayment of costs spent by governmental entities or others performing remediation at approximately 50 sites in the us many of these sites are landfills used by the company in the past for the disposal of waste materials others are secondary lead smelters and lead recycling sites where the company returned leadcontaining materials for recycling a few involve the cleanup of company manufacturing facilities and the remaining fall into miscellaneous categories the company may face similar claims of liability at additional sites in the future where potential liabilities are alleged the company pursues a course of action intended to mitigate them 

the company accrues for potential environmental losses in a manner consistent with us generally accepted accounting principles that is when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable its reserves for environmental costs totaled 34 million and 28 million at september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively the company reviews the status of the sites on a quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly such potential liabilities accrued by the company do not take into consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds they do however take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites it is difficult to estimate the company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and 

scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur nevertheless the company has no reason to believe at the present time that any claims penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the company is involved in a number of product liability and various other suits incident to the operation of its businesses insurance coverages are maintained and estimated costs are recorded for claims and suits of this nature it is management’s opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented 

in 1989 johnson controls initiated an action in the milwaukee county wisconsin circuit court johnson controls inc v employers insurance of wausau  which sought reimbursement under comprehensive general liability insurance policies dating from 1954 through 1985 for costs relating to certain environmental matters in 1995 the circuit court dismissed the action based on the wisconsin supreme court’s decision in city of edgerton v general casualty co of wisconsin  the company twice appealed the case to the court of appeals and then petitioned the wisconsin supreme court to review the lower courts’ judgments the supreme court granted the petition and on july 11 2003 overruled its decision in the edgerton case and found that the comprehensive general liability insurance policies may provide coverage for environmental damages the supreme court’s decision remanded the case to the circuit court for further consideration in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 the company filed motions for declaratory judgment in which it sought a ruling that some of its insurers breached their respective duties to defend thus waiving defenses against the company’s environmental claims the company is currently in settlement negotiations with certain of the insurance company defendants and in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 reached agreement with one of the defendants the ultimate outcome of claims against the other defendants cannot be determined at this time however the company expects a decision on its motions for declaratory judgment during fiscal year 2007 

in 2003 the company was involved in an asbestos release during the renovation of a building in lakeland florida following an investigation the us epa turned its findings over to the us attorney for the middle district of florida in november 2005 the us attorney advised the company that it is considering proceedings against the company including proceedings that would involve criminal charges pursuant to section 113c of the clean air act 42 usc § 7413c and section 103 of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act 42 usc § 103 the company believes the release was totally inadvertent and does not believe this should be a criminal matter the company also believes that any monetary sanctions resulting from the us attorney’s pursuit of this matter would not be material 

as previously reported following allegations in a un oilforfood inquiry report that prior to the company’s acquisition of york york had made improper payments to the iraqi regime york and the company jointly undertook to investigate the allegations and offered the companies’ cooperation to the department of justice doj and securities and exchange commission after completing the york acquisition the company continued the internal inquiry and expanded its scope to include other aspects of york’s middle east operations including a review of york’s use of agents consultants and other third parties york’s compliance with the office of foreign assets control licensing requirements and york’s compliance with other potentially applicable trade laws the company has also reviewed certain of york’s sales practices in selected asian markets the factual inquiry is now substantially complete and indicates that in a number of instances york engaged in conduct that may lead to enforcement actions against the company under applicable us laws which give authorities the right to pursue administrative civil and criminal sanctions including monetary penalties the company has been voluntarily disclosing this information and offering continued cooperation with the doj and sec as well as to other relevant authorities in the us departments of treasury commerce and defense the company has begun preliminary discussions with the relevant authorities to explore how these matters may be resolved the company is in the process of evaluating and implementing various remedial measures with respect to york operations

the building efficiency business enters into extended warranties and longterm service and maintenance agreements with certain customers for these arrangements revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the respective contract term

employee benefit plans 

the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement health care plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous yearend measurements of assets and obligations the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as required by us gaap the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 

the discount rate used by the company is based on the interest rate of noncallable highquality corporate bonds with appropriate consideration of the company’s pension plans’ participants’ demographics and benefit payment terms at july 31 2006 the company increased its discount rate on us plans to 650 from 550 at july 31 2005 the increase of 100 basis points was consistent with the changes in published bond indices as adjusted for the pension plan liability profile the change decreased the company’s us projected benefit obligation at september 30 2006 by approximately 300 million 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets the company considers the historical returns on plan assets adjusted for forwardlooking considerations inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans’ invested assets reflecting the relatively longterm nature of the plans’ obligations approximately 60 of the plans’ assets were invested in equities with the balance primarily invested in fixed income instruments at july 31 2006 the company decreased its expected longterm return on us plan assets from 875 to 825

product warranties 

the company offers warranties to its customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement a typical warranty program requires that the company replace defective products within a specified time period from the date of sale the company records an estimate of future warrantyrelated costs based on actual historical return rates at september 30 2006 the company had recorded 162 million of warranty reserves based on an analysis of return rates and other factors  while the company’s warranty costs have historically been within its calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates

risk management 

the company selectively uses financial instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency interest rates and commodity prices all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes at the inception of the hedge the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either 1 a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of a recognized firm commitment a fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation a net investment hedge the company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used 

for all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test the fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated the hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 for commodity hedging contracts the company aligns the critical terms of its derivative contracts with the terms of the supply contracts 

for net investment hedges the company assesses its net investment positions in the foreign operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis the hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a foreign operation does not exceed the company’s net investment positions in the respective foreign operation

foreign exchange 

the company has manufacturing sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies in order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the company’s global diversification foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are as appropriate hedged with financial instruments 

the company hedges 70 to 90 of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures the company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items the company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by sfas no 137 sfas no 138 and sfas no 149

as previously noted the company’s policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for speculative purposes it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying receivables payables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries described above in millions in usd equivalent 

 

interest rates 

the company’s earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to shortterm market rates the company as needed uses interest rate swaps to modify its exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with sfas no 133 the swaps qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges a 10 increase or decrease in the average cost of the company’s variable rate debt including outstanding swaps would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 6 million 

in september 2005 following a definitive merger agreement unanimously approved by the boards of directors of the company and york the company entered into three forward treasury lock agreements to reduce the market risk associated with changes in interest rates associated with the company’s anticipated fixedrate note issuance to finance the acquisition of york the three forward treasury lock agreements which had a combined notional amount of 13 billion fixed a portion of the future interest cost for 5year 10year and 30year bonds the treasury lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges the agreements were unwound at the time the bonds were issued the fair value of each treasury lock agreement or the difference between the treasury lock reference rate and the fixed rate at time of note issuance is amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective note issuance 

commodities 

the company uses commodity contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines as a cash flow hedge gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses upon purchase of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business the maturities of the commodity contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities 

environmental health and safety and other matters 

the company’s global operations are governed by laws addressing protection of the environment environmental laws and worker safety and health worker safety laws under various circumstances these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved by negotiation with regulatory authorities resulting in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material 

environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions however expenditures in 2006 related solely to environmental compliance were not material at september 30 2006 the company had an accrued liability of 34 million relating to environmental matters compared with 28 million one year ago a charge to income is recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated the company’s environmental liabilities do not take into consideration any possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds because of the uncertainties associated with environmental remediation activities at sites where the company may be potentially liable future expenses to remediate identified sites could be considerably higher than the accrued liability however while neither the timing nor the amount of ultimate costs associated with known environmental remediation matters can be determined at this time the company does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

additionally the company is involved in a number of product liability and various other suits incident to the operation of its businesses insurance coverages are maintained and estimated costs are recorded for claims and suits of this nature it is management’s opinion that none of these will have a materially adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented

financial information about business segments 

sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” sfas 131 establishes the standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the company’s chief operating decision maker is its chief executive officer 

using these criteria the company has determined that it has six operating segments two of which within the battery group are aggregated under the accounting standard to arrive at the company’s five reportable segments for financial reporting purposes the battery groups north american and european operations are aggregated for reporting purposes due to their similar economic characteristics similar customers and the similar nature of their products production processes and distribution channels

major customers and competition 

as described previously the company is a major supplier to the automotive industry sales to its major customers as a percentage of consolidated net sales were as follows for the most recent threeyear period 

 

approximately 49 percent of automotive group sales over the last three years were to the three automobile manufacturers listed above in fiscal 2004 approximately 49 percent of the company’s total sales to these manufacturers originated in the united states 36 percent were based in europe and 15 percent were attributable to other foreign markets because of the importance of new vehicle sales of major automotive manufacturers to its operations the company is affected by general business conditions in this industry sales to additional automakers that accounted for more than five percent of company sales included nissan motor co ltd toyota motor corporation and volkswagen ag 

automotive group 

the automotive group faces competition from other automotive parts suppliers and with respect to certain products from the automobile manufacturers who produce or have the capability to produce certain products the group supplies competition is based on technology quality reliability of delivery and price design engineering and product planning are increasingly important factors independent suppliers that represent the principal seating  interior systems competitors include lear corporation faurecia intier automotive delphi corporation and visteon corporation the group primarily competes in the battery market with exide technologies delphi corporation fiamm and east penn manufacturing company 

approximately 81 percent of automotive battery sales worldwide in fiscal 2004 were to the automotive replacement market with the remaining sales to the original equipment market the automotive group is the principal supplier of batteries to many of the largest merchants in the battery aftermarket including advance auto parts autozone bosch group costco interstate battery system of america pep boys and sears roebuck  co it is also a major supplier of automotive batteries to walmart stores automotive batteries are sold throughout the world under private label and under the company’s brand names optima® varta® lth® and heliar® to automotive replacement battery retailers and distributors and to automobile manufacturers as original equipment approximately 62 percent of total automotive battery sales in fiscal 2004 were based in the united states while 38 percent were attributable to the european market 

controls group 

the controls group conducts its operations through thousands of individual contracts that are either negotiated or awarded on a competitive basis key factors in the award of installation contracts include system and service quality price reputation technology application engineering capability and construction management expertise competition for contracts includes many regional national and international controls providers larger competitors in the control systems market include honeywell international and siemens building technologies of siemens ag the services market is highly fragmented with no one company being dominant sales of these services are largely dependent upon numerous individual contracts with commercial businesses worldwide and various departments and agencies of the us federal government the loss of any individual contract would not have a materially adverse effect on the company 

backlog 

at september 30 2004 the company’s automotive group had an incremental backlog of new orders for its seating  interior systems net of discontinued programs to be executed within the next fiscal year of approximately 23 billion which includes orders of approximately 01 billion associated with unconsolidated joint ventures the backlog one year ago was approximately 19 billion the automotive backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and uncertainties such as related vehicle production volumes and the timing of related production launches 

the company’s backlog relating to the controls group is applicable to its sales of installed systems and technical service activity accounted for using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with customary industry practice customers are progress billed on an estimated basis as work proceeds at september 30 2004 the unearned backlog of installed systems contracts to be executed within the next fiscal year was 184 billion compared with the prior year’s 175 billion the preceding data does not include amounts associated with facility management service contracts because such contracts are typically multiyear service awards the backlog amount outstanding at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the coming fiscal period 

raw materials 

raw materials used by the automotive group in connection with its automotive seating  interior systems and battery operations including steel urethane chemicals lead sulfuric acid and polypropylene were readily available during the year and such availability is expected to continue although the raw materials are expected to continue to be readily available costs of certain commodities such as steel and lead are expected to rise significantly in the upcoming fiscal year the controls group is not dependent upon any single source of supply for essential materials parts or components 

intellectual property 

generally the company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by contracts licenses confidentiality or other agreements 

the company owns numerous us and foreign patents and their respective counterparts the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products while the company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset no single patent or group of patents is critical to the success of the business the company from time to time grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others 

the company has numerous registered trademarks in the united states and in many foreign countries the most important of these marks are “johnson controls” including a stylized version thereof “jci” and “johnson ” these marks are universally used in connection with certain of its product lines and services the trademarks and service marks “penn ” “metasys ” “cardkey” “homelink” “autovision” “travelnote” “blueconnect” “railport” “optima” “varta” “lth” “heliar” “inspira” and others are used in connection with certain company product lines and services the company also markets automotive batteries under the licensed trademarks “eveready” and “energizer ” 

most works of authorship produced for the company such as computer programs catalogs and sales literature carry appropriate notices indicating the company’s claim to copyright protection under us law and appropriate international treaties 

environmental health and safety matters 

laws addressing the protection of the environment environmental laws and workers’ safety and health worker safety laws govern the company’s ongoing global operations they generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where companyrelated materials have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the company’s businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances 

the company’s operations and facilities have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with such laws or for the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved by negotiation with regulatory authorities that result in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor such penalties have been material see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for a discussion of the company’s potential environmental liabilities 

environmental capital expenditures 

the company’s ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures however expenditures in 2004 related solely to environmental compliance were not material it is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year 

employees 

as of september 30 2004 the company employed approximately 123000 employees of whom approximately 79000 were hourly and 44000 were salaried 

seasonal factors 

sales of automotive seating  interior systems and batteries to automobile manufacturers for use as original equipment are dependent upon the demand for new automobiles management believes that demand for new automobiles generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions with no material seasonal effect the automotive replacement battery market is affected by weather patterns because batteries are more likely to fail when extremely low temperatures place substantial additional power requirements upon a vehicle’s electrical system also battery life is shortened by extremely high temperatures which accelerate corrosion rates 

therefore either mild winter or moderate summer temperatures may adversely affect automotive replacement battery sales 

the controls group’s activities are executed on a relatively continuous basis with no significant fluctuation in revenues during the year

 item 3   legal proceedings 

environmental litigation and proceedings and other matters 

as noted previously liabilities potentially arise globally under various environmental laws and worker safety laws for activities that are not in compliance with such laws and for the cleanup of sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

currently the company is responding to allegations that it is responsible for performing environmental remediation or for the repayment of costs spent by governmental entities or others performing remediation at approximately 50 sites in the united states many of these sites are landfills used by the company in the past for the disposal of waste materials others are secondary lead smelters and lead recycling sites where the company returned leadcontaining materials for recycling a few involve the cleanup of company manufacturing facilities and the remaining fall into miscellaneous categories the company may face similar claims of liability at additional sites in the future where potential liabilities are alleged the company pursues a course of action intended to mitigate them 

the company accrues for potential environmental losses consistent with generally accepted accounting principles that is when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable its reserves for environmental costs totaled 61 million and 62 million at september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively the company reviews the status of the sites on a quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly such potential liabilities accrued by the company do not take into consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds they do however take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites it is difficult to estimate the company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur nevertheless the company has no reason to believe at the present time that any claims penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

typically site remediation matters are addressed at the administrative agency level of the government occasionally however litigation is involved the most significant of such matters where litigation has been commenced by the government or by private parties and remains pending against the company is the following 

united states v nl industries inc  case no 91cv00578wds united states district court for the southern district of illinois filed july 31 1991 the epa sought to enforce an administrative order issued on november 27 1990 against johnson controls and other defendants requiring performance of a cleanup at a secondary smelter facility in granite city illinois the company executed a consent decree in 1999 settling the matter which the court entered in 2003 most of the work and payments required by the consent decree have been completed or made and accrued liabilities relating to environmental matters include an amount attributable to the remaining costs 

additionally the company is involved in a number of product liability and various other suits incident to the operation of its businesses insurance coverages are maintained and estimated costs are recorded for claims and suits of this nature it is management’s opinion that none of these will have a materially adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented 

in 1989 johnson controls initiated an action in the milwaukee county wisconsin circuit court johnson controls inc v employers insurance of wausau  which sought reimbursement under comprehensive general liability insurance policies dating from 1954 through 1985 for costs relating to certain environmental matters in 1995 the circuit court dismissed the action based on the wisconsin supreme court’s decision in city of 

edgerton v general casualty co of wisconsin  the company twice appealed the case to the court of appeals and then petitioned the wisconsin supreme court to review the lower courts’ judgments the supreme court granted the petition and on july 11 2003 overruled its decision in the edgerton case and found that the comprehensive general liability insurance policies may provide coverage for environmental damages subject to other available defenses the supreme court’s decision remands the case to the circuit court for further consideration where the merits of johnson controls’ various environmental claims will be determined

controls group sales in north america were six percent greater than one year ago due to growth in systems installation and services systems installation sales were up reflecting higher volumes in the new construction market service sales were higher in comparison to the prior year reflecting additional commercial facility management service activity and an increase in technical service revenues 

sales in europe increased 14 percent over the prior year reflecting the positive effects of currency translation and the growth of installed systems in the new construction market controls group sales in other geographic markets which represent less than 10 percent of the segment’s sales increased slightly compared to fiscal 2003 

seating  interiors – north america in north america seating  interiors sales were 90 billion up 12 percent versus the prior year this strong growth reflects new interior systems business with a variety of automakers and involvement in platforms with production levels that exceeded the industry average 

seating  interiors – europe in europe seating  interiors sales were 81 billion up 32 percent versus the prior year excluding the effects of currency translation sales grew 18 yearoveryear the growth is primarily due to the launch of new business and favorable platform mix 

seating  interiors – asia in asia seating  interiors sales were 11 billion up 8 versus the prior year excluding the effects of currency translation sales grew 4 percent yearoveryear the growth is primarily due to higher volumes in korea and china this was partially offset by lower volumes in japan and malaysia due to decreased demand for mature vehicle platforms which are nearing the end of their product life cycle 

battery group battery group sales were 23 billion up 21 percent versus the prior year excluding the effects of currency translation sales grew 16 percent yearoveryear 

north american sales of automotive batteries increased 14 percent over last year primarily due to passthrough pricing of higher lead costs and slightly higher shipments to existing customers battery sales were also favorably impacted by 37 million for the inclusion of two months of operations associated with the acquisition of the remaining 51 percent interest in its joint venture with grupo imsa sa de cv latin american jv see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

european sales of automotive batteries increased 34 percent over the prior year primarily due to favorable currency translation the inclusion of one additional month from the acquisition of varta see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements slightly higher automotive battery unit shipments and the passthrough pricing of higher lead costs to customers 

fiscal 2005 sales outlook 

for fiscal 2005 management anticipates automotive group which includes seating  interiors and the battery group sales will grow by 8 to 10 percent assuming a slight decrease in industry production in north america and europe and a relatively stable dollar new interior systems business and higher sales of automotive batteries are expected in fiscal 2005 at september 30 2004 seating  interiors had an incremental backlog of new orders for its interior systems to be executed within the next fiscal year of 23 billion which includes orders of approximately 100 million associated with unconsolidated joint ventures the backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and uncertainties such as related vehicle production volumes and the timing of production launches 

controls group sales for fiscal 2005 are expected to increase approximately 8 to 10 percent over fiscal 2004 the projected increase anticipates doubledigit growth in technical services and facility management services in the commercial market and slightly higher installed control system sales 

orders of installed control systems and technical services for the year ended september 30 2004 exceeded the prior year level driven primarily by growth in europe orders for installed control systems were primarily in the domestic new construction and european existing building markets 

the segment’s backlog relates to its installed control systems and technical service activity and is accounted for using the percentageofcompletion poc method at september 30 2004 the unearned backlog to be executed within the next year was 184 billion five percent above the prior year’s 175 billion the majority of the increase was attributable to the increase in orders in north america and europe 

operating income 

the company’s operating income for the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 was as follows 

 

 

 

consolidated operating income for fiscal 2004 was 13 billion 12 percent above the prior year’s 12 billion consolidated operating income in fiscal 2004 includes restructuring costs of 82 million see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and a pension gain of 84 million see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in comparison to fiscal 2003 

controls group fiscal 2004 controls group operating income of 284 million excluding 13 million of restructuring costs was one percent above the prior year the results were attributable to higher volumes and favorable effects of currency translation partially offset by lower gross margin percentages in north america and higher worldwide selling general and administrative sga expenses in north america the benefit from higher volumes of installed control systems and new facility management business was slightly offset by lower gross margin percentages in the installed systems business due to the competitive new construction environment in europe gross profit excluding the effects of currency translation was comparable to the prior year sga expenses were higher worldwide resulting from investments in sales force additions in the technical service business increased pension and health care costs and the impact of currency translation 

seating  interiors – north america seating  interiors – north america operating income decreased 11 percent to 586 million excluding 5 million of restructuring costs due to higher commodity costs and higher sga expenses partially offset by cost reductions and operational efficiencies 

the segment experienced commodity cost increases primarily steel of approximately 15 million compared to the prior year the company continues to address the rising commodity costs in the region through negotiations with both its customers and suppliers 

implemented cost reductions and operational efficiencies exceeded the impact of a lower sales mix of mature vehicle programs and incremental sales price reductions by 16 million in the period the lower sales mix of mature vehicle programs negatively impacted results as these sales typically deliver more favorable margins due 

to operational efficiencies and cost reductions that are implemented throughout the vehicle life cycle in contrast new vehicle programs require significant engineering and start up costs thereby reducing margins at the onset of the program annual price reduction renewal negotiations during the period yielded terms consistent with prior agreements it should be noted that price reduction commitments are often made in the context of broader customer negotiations on several factors including volume potential new business opportunities and geographic expansion 

sga expenses increased 70 million in the year primarily due to increased engineering expenses incurred for new vehicle programs higher health care pension and insurance costs as well as the impact of currency translation 

seating  interiors – europe operating income in europe was 154 million excluding 51 million of restructuring costs compared to a prior year loss of 24 million due to higher volumes an increase of 178 million due to performance improvements in the majority of the company’s product offerings and lower sga expenses partially offset by higher commodity costs excluding the positive effects of foreign currency translation operating income increased 172 million 

the segment benefited from the full year impact of the region’s turnaround program which concentrated on the implementation of best business practices and six sigma activities in its existing operations new program launches and changes to the manufacturing footprint implemented cost reductions operational efficiencies and the higher sales mix of mature vehicle programs exceeded incremental sales price reductions by 167 million in the period annual sales price reduction renewal negotiations during the period yielded terms consistent with prior agreements 

the incremental effect of commodity costs totaled approximately 5 million in the current fiscal year compared to the prior year as in other regions the company continues to address the rising commodity costs through negotiations with both its customers and suppliers 

sga expenses decreased 10 million in the year primarily due to decreased engineering expenses incurred for new vehicle programs compared to the prior year 

seating  interiors – asia operating income in asia decreased to 38 million in the current year excluding 84 million of a pension gain 10 percent below the prior year excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation operating income decreased 22 percent yearoveryear this decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of sga expenditures and launch costs in japan and korea related to new program awards 

although overall volumes were up the segment’s margins were unfavorably impacted by a significant decrease in sales of higher margin mature vehicle programs that benefit from operating efficiencies and cost reductions achieved through the product life cycle 

sga expenses in the segment were approximately 12 million higher in the year primarily due to increased engineering expenses incurred for new vehicle programs 

battery group battery group operating income increased to 237 million excluding 13 million of restructuring costs in the current fiscal year 15 percent above the prior year’s 207 million in north america higher volumes increased operating efficiencies and the purchase of the latin american jv which contributed 13 million more than offset higher commodity costs the incremental effect of commodity costs unfavorably impacted north america operating income by 16 million versus the prior year operating income in europe was higher due to increased volumes and integration savings achieved from previous acquisitions which outpaced increases in commodity costs the incremental effect of commodity costs in europe on operating income was unfavorable by 28 million versus the prior year 

fiscal 2005 operating income outlook 

in fiscal 2005 the company anticipates that growth by both the automotive group which includes seating  interiors and the battery group and the controls group together with improvements in operational quality and cost will lead to a 10 to 12 percent increase in operating income 

the automotive group operating margin percentage for fiscal 2005 is expected to increase slightly compared to fiscal 2004 management anticipates that the benefits of operational efficiencies restructuring and lower launch costs will be partially offset by lower pricing higher commodity costs and increased employee benefit costs the automotive group has supply agreements with certain of its customers that provide for annual price reductions and in some instances for the recovery of material cost increases the group expects to continue its historical trend of being able to significantly offset any sales price changes with cost reductions from design changes and productivity improvements and through similar programs with its own suppliers 

the controls group operating margin percentage for fiscal 2005 is expected to decline moderately compared to the fiscal 2004 level this reflects competitive pricing in the new construction market a higher proportion of facility management sales with inherently lower margins and rising employee benefit costs these factors are expected to be partially offset by strong technical services growth and improved operational efficiencies in north america 

restructuring costs 

in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 the company executed a restructuring plan involving cost structure improvement actions and recorded an 824 million restructuring charge within selling general and administrative sga expenses in the consolidated statement of income these costs primarily relate to workforce reductions of approximately 1500 employees in the seating  interiors and battery group and 470 employees in the controls group in addition four seating  interiors plants will be consolidated through september 30 2004 all impacted employees from the controls group and approximately 1100 employees from the seating  interiors and battery group have been separated from the company employee severance and termination benefits are paid over the severance period granted to each employee and on a lump sum basis when required in accordance with individual severance agreements a significant portion of the seating  interiors and battery group actions are concentrated in europe as the company focuses on significantly improving profitability in the region the controls group restructuring actions involve activities in both north america and europe no further costs related to these specific actions are anticipated the majority of the restructuring activities are expected to be completed within one year

increased earnings at certain seating  interiors joint ventures in china miscellaneous – net expense was 8 million higher than fiscal 2003 mainly due to higher foreign currency losses in the current year and the inclusion of a gain in the prior year related to the conversion and subsequent disposition of the investment in donnelly corporation see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

provision for income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for the year ended september 30 2004 was 260 percent compared with last year’s 310 percent the effective rate for the current fiscal year was lower than the combined us federal and state statutory rate due to reduced foreign and us effective rates resulting from the continued benefits of global tax planning initiatives the rate was further impacted by a 17 million favorable tax settlement received in the first quarter and a 10 million favorable resolution of worldwide tax audits in the fourth quarter 

minority interests in net earnings of subsidiaries 

minority interests in net earnings of subsidiaries were 79 million compared with 47 million in the prior year primarily due to higher earnings at certain seating  interiors subsidiaries in north america and the absence of significant engineering and launch costs incurred in the prior year 

net income

evidence of the relative fair value of each element recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as an asset captioned “costs and earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” likewise contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as a liability captioned “billings in excess of costs and earnings on uncompleted contracts” changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed monthly sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values estimated losses are recorded when identified claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement  the use of the poc method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods the reviews have not resulted in adjustments that were significant to the company’s results of operations the company continually evaluates all of the issues related to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the poc method of accounting in all other cases the company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped and title passes to the customer or as services are performed 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

in conformity with us gaap goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units which have been determined to be the company’s reportable segments using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis in estimating the fair value the company uses multiples of earnings based on the average of historical published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value the impairment testing performed by the company at september 30 2004 indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount including recorded goodwill and as such no impairment existed at that time other intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives indefinite and definite lived intangible assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements are also subject to impairment testing a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and therefore impairment charges could be required 

employee benefit plans 

the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement health care plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous yearend measurements of assets and obligations the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as required by us gaap the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 

the discount rate used by the company is based on the interest rate of noncallable highquality corporate bonds with appropriate consideration of the company’s pension plans’ participants’ demographics and benefit payment terms at july 31 2004 the company decreased its discount rate on us plans to 625 percent from 650 percent at july 31 2003 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements the decline of 25 basis points was consistent with the changes in published bond indices the change increased the company’s us projected benefit obligation at september 30 2004 by approximately 56 million and is expected to increase pension expense in fiscal year 2005 by approximately 8 million 

in estimating the expected return on plan assets the company considers the historical returns on plan assets adjusted for forwardlooking considerations inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans’ invested assets reflecting the relatively longterm nature of the plans’ obligations approximately 60 percent of the plans’ assets were invested in equities with the balance primarily invested in fixed income instruments 

the company uses a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets over a threeyear period as of september 30 2004 the company had approximately 9 million of unrecognized asset losses associated with its us pension plans which will be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of assets and subject to amortization in future periods 

based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the company has recorded a prepaid benefit cost of 185 million for its us pension plans as of september 30 2004 in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas 87 sfas 87 requires that an asset be recognized if the net periodic pension cost is less than the amounts the employer has contributed to the plan and a liability be recognized if the net periodic pension cost exceeds amounts the employer has contributed to the plan the funded status of a retirement plan is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the plan’s benefit formula to employee service at september 30 2004 the company’s us pension plans were under funded by 248 million since the projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of its plan assets material differences may result between the funded status of a retirement plan and the recorded asset or liability due to certain items that have an immediate impact on the projected benefit obligation but are recognized over a longer period of time in the net periodic pension cost for example at september 30 2004 the company had an unrecognized net actuarial loss on its us pension plans of 405 million this actuarial loss is included in the projected benefit obligation at september 30 2004 but in accordance with sfas 87 in general the amount of the loss is amortized to net periodic pension expense over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plan where the loss was generated 

product warranties 

the company offers warranties to its customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement most of the company’s product warranties are customer specific a typical warranty program requires that the company replace defective products within a specified time period from the date of sale the company records an estimate of future warrantyrelated costs based on actual historical return rates at september 30 2004 the company had recorded 70 million of warranty reserves based on an analysis of return rates and other factors see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements  while the company’s warranty costs have historically been within its calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents foreign operating and other loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis the company uses an estimate of the 

annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period on a quarterly basis the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information since future financial results may differ from previous estimates periodic adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance may be necessary at september 30 2004 the company had a valuation allowance of 572 million primarily related to net operating and other loss carryforwards mainly in germany italy mexico united kingdom japan and brazil see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not provide additional united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries included in stockholders’ equity such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation the company’s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries or to be repatriated only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits 

risk management 

the company selectively uses financial instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency interest rates and commodity prices all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes at the inception of the hedge the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either 1 a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation a net investment hedge the company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used 

for all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test the fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated the hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80 and 125 percent 

for net investment hedges the company assesses its net investment positions in the foreign operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a monthly basis the hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a foreign operation do not exceed the company’s net investment positions in the respective foreign operation 

a discussion of the company’s accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange 

the company has manufacturing sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies in order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the company’s global diversification foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are as appropriate hedged with financial instruments 

the company hedges 70 to 90 percent of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures the company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses 

on the hedged items the company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by sfas no 137 no 138 and no 149 

the company generally finances its foreign operations with local nonus dollar debt the foreigncurrency denominated debt serves as a natural hedge of the foreign operations’ net asset positions the company has also entered into several foreign currencydenominated debt obligations and crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge portions of its net investments in europe and japan the currency effects of the debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss account within shareholders’ equity where they offset gains and losses recorded on the net investments in europe and japan 

sensitivity analysis the following table indicates the total us dollar usd equivalents of net foreign exchange contracts hedging transactional exposure and nonus dollar denominated cash debt and crosscurrency interest rate swaps hedging translation exposure outstanding by currency and the corresponding impact on the value of these instruments assuming a 10 percent appreciationdepreciation of the us dollar relative to all other currencies on september 30 2004 

as previously noted the company’s policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for profit it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying receivables payables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries described above 

 

interest rates 

the company’s earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to shortterm market rates the company as needed uses interest rate swaps to modify its exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with sfas no 133 the swaps qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges a 10 percent increase or decrease in the average cost of the company’s variable rate debt including outstanding swaps would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately 4 million 

environmental health and safety and other matters 

the company’s global operations are governed by laws addressing protection of the environment environmental laws and worker safety and health worker safety laws under various circumstances these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment 

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers the company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance however the company has been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved by negotiation with regulatory authorities resulting in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the company have been material 

environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions however expenditures in 2004 related solely to environmental compliance were not material at september 30 2004 the company had an accrued liability of 61 million relating to environmental matters compared with 62 million one year ago a charge to income is recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated the company’s environmental liabilities do not take into consideration any possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds because of the uncertainties associated with environmental remediation activities at sites where the company may be potentially liable future expenses to remediate identified sites could be considerably higher than the accrued liability however while neither the timing nor the amount of ultimate costs associated with known environmental remediation matters can be determined at this time the company does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

additionally the company is involved in a number of product liability and various other suits incident to the operation of its businesses insurance coverages are maintained and estimated costs are recorded for claims and suits of this nature it is management’s opinion that none of these will have a materially adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented 

cautionary statements for forwardlooking information 

the company has made forwardlooking statements in this document pertaining to its financial results for fiscal 2005 and future years that are based on preliminary data and are subject to risks and uncertainties forwardlooking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future risks and may include words such as “believes” “forecasts” “expects” “outlook” or similar expressions for those statements the company cautions that numerous important factors such as automotive vehicle production levels and schedules the strength of the us or other economies currency exchange rates cancellation of commercial contracts as well as those factors discussed in the company’s form 8k filing dated october 26 2004 could affect the company’s actual results and could cause its actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement made by or on behalf of the company

environmental health and safety matters laws addressing the protection of the environment environmental laws and workers’ safety and health worker safety laws govern the company’s ongoing global operations they generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and remedial relief for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where companyrelated materials have been released into the environment the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the company’s businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment the company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances the company’s operations and facilities have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with such laws or for the remediation of companyrelated substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved by negotiation with regulatory authorities that result in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties historically neither such commitments nor such penalties have been material see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for a discussion of the company’s potential environmental liabilities environmental capital expenditures the company’s ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures however expenditures in 2004 related solely to environmental compliance were not material it is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year employees as of september 30 2004 the company employed approximately 123000 employees of whom approximately 79000 were hourly and 44000 were salaried seasonal factors sales of automotive interior systems and batteries to automobile manufacturers for use as original equipment are dependent upon the demand for new automobiles management believes that demand for new automobiles generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions with no material seasonal effect the automotive replacement battery market is affected by weather patterns because batteries are more likely to fail when extremely low temperatures place substantial additional power requirements upon a vehicle’s electrical system also battery life is shortened by extremely high temperatures which accelerate corrosion rates therefore either 9 

mild winter or moderate summer temperatures may adversely affect automotive replacement battery sales the controls group’s activities are executed on a relatively continuous basis with no significant fluctuation in revenues during the year financial information about geographic areas note 20 “segment information” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 48 and 49 of the 2004 annual report to shareholders is incorporated herein by reference research and development expenditures note 15 “research and development” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 46 of the 2004 annual report to shareholders is incorporated herein by reference available information the company’s filings with the securities and exchange commission sec including annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q definitive proxy statements on form 14a current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed pursuant to section 13 or 15d of the exchange act are made available free of charge through the investor relations section of the company’s internet website at httpwwwjohnsoncontrolscom as soon as reasonably practicable after the company electronically files such material with or furnishes it to the sec copies of any materials the company files with the sec can also be obtained free of charge through the sec’s website at httpwwwsecgov at the sec’s public reference room at 450 fifth st nw washington dc 20549 or by calling the sec’s public reference room at 18007320330 the company also makes available free of charge its ethics policy corporate governance guidelines committee charters and other information related to the company on the company’s internet website or in printed form upon request

 item 3   legal proceedings environmental litigation and proceedings and other matters as noted previously liabilities potentially arise globally under various environmental laws and worker safety laws for activities that are not in compliance with such laws and for the cleanup of sites where companyrelated substances have been released into the environment currently the company is responding to allegations that it is responsible for performing environmental remediation or for the repayment of costs spent by governmental entities or others performing remediation at approximately 50 sites in the united states many of these sites are landfills used by the company in the past for the disposal of waste materials others are secondary lead smelters and lead recycling sites where the company returned leadcontaining materials for recycling a few involve the cleanup of company manufacturing facilities and the remaining fall into miscellaneous categories the company may face similar claims of liability at additional sites in the future where potential liabilities are alleged the company pursues a course of action intended to mitigate them the company accrues for potential environmental losses consistent with generally accepted accounting principles that is when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable its reserves for environmental costs totaled 61 million and 62 million at september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively the company reviews the status of the sites on a quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly such potential liabilities accrued by the company do not take into consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds they do however take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites it is difficult to estimate the company’s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur nevertheless the company has no reason to believe at the present time that any claims penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows typically site remediation matters are addressed at the administrative agency level of the government occasionally however litigation is involved the most significant of such matters where litigation has been commenced by the government or by private parties and remains pending against the company is the following united states v nl industries inc  case no 91cv00578wds united states district court for the southern district of illinois filed july 31 1991 the epa sought to enforce an administrative order issued on november 27 1990 against johnson controls and other defendants requiring performance of a cleanup at a secondary smelter facility in granite city illinois the company executed a consent decree in 1999 settling the matter which the court entered in 2003 most of the work and payments required by the consent decree have been completed or made and accrued liabilities relating to environmental matters include an amount attributable to the remaining costs 14 

additionally the company is involved in a number of product liability and various other suits incident to the operation of its businesses insurance coverages are maintained and estimated costs are recorded for claims and suits of this nature it is management’s opinion that none of these will have a materially adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows in 1989 johnson controls initiated an action in the milwaukee county wisconsin circuit court johnson controls inc v employers insurance of wausau  which sought reimbursement under comprehensive general liability insurance policies dating from 1954 through 1985 for costs relating to certain environmental matters in 1995 the circuit court dismissed the action based on the wisconsin supreme court’s decision in city of edgerton v general casualty co of wisconsin  the company twice appealed the case to the court of appeals and then petitioned the wisconsin supreme court to review the lower courts’ judgments the supreme court granted the petition and on july 11 2003 overruled its decision in the edgerton case and found that the comprehensive general liability insurance policies may provide coverage for environmental damages subject to other available defenses the supreme court’s decision remands the case to the circuit court for further consideration where the merits of johnson controls’ various environmental claims will be determined

page


the automotive systems group faces competition from other automotive parts
suppliers and with respect to certain products from the automobile
manufacturers who produce or have the capability to produce certain products or
services the segment supplies competition is based on technology quality
reliability of delivery and price design engineering and product planning are
increasingly important factors independent suppliers that represent the
segments principal competitors include lear corporation faurecia intier
automotive delphi corporation and visteon corporation

approximately 87 percent of the automotive systems groups automotive battery

competes in the battery market with exide technologies delphi corporation and
east penn manufacturing company

controls group

the controls group conducts its operations through thousands of individual
contracts that are either negotiated or awarded on a competitive basis key
factors in the award of contracts include product and service quality price
reputation technology application engineering capability and construction
management expertise competition for contracts includes many regional national
and international controls providers larger competitors in the control systems
market include honeywell international and siemens building technologies of
siemens ag the services market is highly fragmented with no one company being
dominant sales of these services are largely dependent upon numerous individual
contracts with commercial businesses worldwide and various departments and
agencies of the us federal government the loss of any individual contract
would not have a materially adverse effect on the company

backlog

at september 30 2002 the companys automotive systems group had an incremental
backlog of new orders for its interior systems to be executed within the next
fiscal year of approximately 10 billion compared with 08 billion one year
ago the automotive backlog is generally subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties such as related vehicle production volumes and the timing of
related production launches

the companys backlog relating to the controls group is applicable to its sales
of control systems which principally are sold under longterm contracts that
are accounted for on the

page


percentageofcompletion method in accordance with customary industry practice
customers are progress billed on an estimated basis as work proceeds at
september 30 2002 the unearned backlog of installed control systems contracts
to be executed within the next fiscal year was 165 billion compared with the
prior years 149 billion the preceding data does not include amounts
associated with facility management service contracts because such contracts are
typically multiyear service awards the backlog amount outstanding at any given
time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the
coming fiscal period

raw materials

raw materials used by the automotive systems group in connection with its
automotive interiors and battery operations including steel urethane
chemicals lead sulfuric acid and polypropylene were readily available during
the year and such availability is expected to continue the controls group is
not dependent upon any single source of supply for essential materials parts or
components

intellectual property

generally the company seeks statutory protection for most intellectual property
embodied in patents trademarks and copyrights some intellectual property
where appropriate or possible is protected by a contract license agreement or
holdinconfidence undertaking

the company owns numerous us and foreign patents and their respective
counterparts the more important of which cover those technologies and
inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of
those products while the company believes patents are important to its business
operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset no single patent
or group of patents is critical to the success of the business the company
from time to time grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives
licenses under patents and technology of others

the company has numerous registered trademarks in the united states and in many
foreign countries the most important of these marks are johnson controls
including a stylized version thereof jci and johnson  these marks are
universally used in connection with certain of its product lines and services
the trademarks and service marks penn  metasys  cardkey homelink
autovision travelnote blueconnect optima and inspira are used in
connection with certain company product lines and services the company also
markets automotive batteries under the licensed trademarks eveready and
energizer 

most works of authorship produced for the company such as computer programs
catalogs and sales literature carry appropriate notices indicating the
companys claim to copyright protection under us law and appropriate
international treaties

environmental health and safety matters

laws addressing the protection of the environment environmental laws and
workers safety and health worker safety laws govern the companys ongoing
global operations  they

page

generally provide for civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive and
remedial relief for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where
companyrelated materials have been released into the environment

the company has expended substantial resources globally both financial and
managerial to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and
maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance certain of the
companys businesses are or have been engaged in the handling or use of
substances that may impact work health and safety or the environment the
company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the
risks associated with these substances

the companys operations and facilities have been and in the future may become
the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for
noncompliance with such laws or for the remediation of companyrelated
substances released into the environment such matters typically are resolved by
negotiation with regulatory authorities that result in commitments to
compliance abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of
penalties historically neither such commitments nor such penalties have been
material see item 3 legal proceedings of this report for a discussion of the
companys potential environmental liabilities

environmental capital expenditures

the companys ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital
expenditures environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital
expenditures however expenditures in 2002 related solely to environmental
compliance were not material it is managements opinion that the amount of any
future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not
have a material adverse effect on the companys financial results or competitive
position in any one year

employees

as of september 30 2002 the company employed approximately 111000 employees
of whom approximately 70000 were hourly and 41000 were salaried

seasonal factors

sales of automotive interior systems and batteries to automobile manufacturers
for use as original equipment are dependent upon the demand for new automobiles
management believes that demand for new automobiles generally reflects
sensitivity to overall economic conditions with no material seasonal effect the
automotive replacement battery market is affected by weather patterns because
batteries are more likely to fail when extremely low temperatures place
substantial additional power requirements upon a vehicles electrical system
also battery life is shortened by extremely high temperatures which accelerate
corrosion rates therefore either mild winter or moderate summer temperatures
may adversely affect automotive replacement battery sales



page

with no significant fluctuation in revenues during the year

item 3   legal proceedings

environmental litigation and proceedings and other matters

as noted previously liabilities potentially arise globally under various
environmental laws and worker safety laws for activities that are not in
compliance with such laws and for the cleanup of sites where companyrelated
substances have been released into the environment

currently the company is responding to allegations that it is responsible for
performing environmental remediation or for the repayment of costs spent by
governmental entities or others performing remediation at approximately 50
sites many of these sites are landfills used by the company in the past for the
disposal of waste materials others are secondary lead smelters and lead
recycling sites where the company returned leadcontaining materials for
recycling a few involve the cleanup of company manufacturing facilities and
the remaining fall into

page


miscellaneous categories the company may face similar claims of liability at
additional sites in the future where potential liabilities are alleged the
company pursues a course of action intended to mitigate them

the company accrues for potential environmental losses consistent with generally
accepted accounting principles that is when it is probable a loss has been
incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable its reserves for
environmental costs totaled 32 million and 28 million at september 30 2002
and 2001 respectively the company reviews the status of the sites on a
quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly such potential liabilities
accrued by the company do not take into consideration possible recoveries of
future insurance proceeds they do however take into account the likely share
other parties will bear at remediation sites it is difficult to estimate the
companys ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large
number of other parties that may be involved the complexity of determining the
relative liability among those parties the uncertainty as to the nature and
scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted the uncertainty in
the application of law and risk assessment the various choices and costs
associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at
the sites and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation
may occur nevertheless the company has no reason to believe at the present
time that any claims penalties or costs in connection with known environmental
matters will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position
results of operations or cash flows

typically site remediation matters are addressed at the administrative agency
level of the government occasionally however litigation is involved the most
significant of such matters where litigation has been commenced by the
government or by private parties and remains pending against the company is as
follows

        united states v nl industries inc case no 91cv00578wds united
        states district court for the southern district of illinois filed july
        31 1991 the epa sought to enforce an administrative order issued on
        november 27 1990 against johnson controls and other defendants
        requiring performance of a cleanup at a secondary smelter facility in
        granite city illinois the company the other defendants and the other
        parties to the 1990 order chose to not perform on the basis that the
        administrative record of decision underlying that order did not support
        the remedy the agency was requiring the complaint alleged that the
        defendants should pay penalties up to 25000 per day and three times
        the cost of work the government performs for failing to comply with the
        order it also alleged that the company should be responsible for past
        government expenditures according to the agency the total cost both
        past and future will probably exceed 64 million the company executed
        a consent decree settling this matter but the court has not yet entered
        the decree nevertheless the company and the other parties to the
        consent decree have performed almost all of the work required by the
        decree the reserves relating to environmental matters include an amount
        attributable to the cost of the remaining work that the company will
        perform in conjunction with other parties at the site as well as
        payment to the federal government for the companys share of past
        response costs and penalties

in march 2002 an unfavorable verdict was rendered in a lawsuit involving a
mexican lead supplier after a jury trial a texas trial court entered judgment
against the company

page


in this matter and awarded damages to the plaintiff in the amount of 22
million plus interest and attorney fees the company and its legal counsel
believe that the verdict against the company in the trial court was incorrect
and that it will be reversed on appeal while it is not possible to ascertain
the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to this lawsuit the
company believes that the amount of such liability if any in excess of amounts
provided will not have a material impact on the companys financial position
results of operations or cash flows

variations industrial operations such as water gas or steam pressure and
process flow controls or other hazards these detection devices are connected
to a microprocessorbased control panel which communicates through telephone
lines to a monitoring center often located at remote distances from the
customers premises where alarm and supervisory signals are received and
recorded in most systems control panels can identify the nature of the alarm
and the areas within a building where the sensor was activated depending upon
the type of service for which the subscriber has contracted monitoring center
personnel respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to the local
fire or police departments notifying the customer or taking other appropriate
action such as dispatching employees to the customers premises in some
instances the customer may monitor the system at its own premises or the system
may be connected to local fire or police departments

departments defense installations and health care and educational facilities

specific needs and include electronic monitoring services that provide intrusion
and fire detection as well as card or keypad activated access control systems
and closed circuit television systems systems may be monitored by the customer
at its premises or connected to one of our monitoring centers in either case
we usually provide support and maintenance through service contracts it has
been our experience that commercial and residential contracts are generally
renewed after their initial terms contract discontinuances occur principally as
a result of customer relocation or closure systems installed at commercial
customers premises may be owned by us or by our customer we usually retain
ownership of standard residential systems but more sophisticated residential
systems are usually purchased by our customers

customers through a direct sales force and an authorized dealer network
commercial customers are serviced by a separate national accounts sales force

competitive with a number of major firms and approximately 12000 smaller
regional and local companies tyco also competes with several national companies
and several thousand regional and local companies in europe the middle east
the asiapacific region latin america and south africa competition is based
primarily on price in relation to quality of service we believe that the
quality of our electronic security services is higher than that of many of our
competitors and therefore our prices may be higher than those charged by our
competitors

customer financing the increase in backlog in healthcare and specialty products
is due to the deferral of 716 million of net revenue as a result of the
adoption of sab 101 backlog in the healthcare and specialty products segment
represents unfilled orders which in the nature of the business are normally
shipped shortly after purchase orders are received we do not view backlog in
the healthcare industry to be a significant indicator of the level of future
sales activity

covering approximately 54400 employees at certain of our north american
european and asiapacific businesses we believe that our relations with the
labor unions and with our employees are generally satisfactory in april 1994
following lengthy negotiations contracts between our grinnell subsidiary and a
number of local unions affiliated with the united association of plumbers and
pipefitters were not renewed employees in those locations representing
64 percent of grinnell fire protections north american union employees at the
time went on strike the strike ended in january 2001 grinnell has reinstated
relevant terms of the expired collective bargaining agreement and has resumed
negotiations with the local unions over a new agreement grinnell is currently
participating in a proceeding to determine what payments are necessary to
compensate certain employees for losses they may have suffered as a result of
changes in their wages and benefits that grinnell implemented in 1994 the
action has not had and is not expected to have any material adverse effect on
our business or results of operations

environmental matters

    we make a substantial effort to operate our facilities in compliance with
laws relating to the protection of the environment compliance has not had and
is not expected to have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures
earnings or competitive position

    we believe that consistent with applicable laws and regulations we
exercise due care and take appropriate precautions in the management of wastes
we have received notification from the united states environmental protection
agency and from certain state environmental agencies that conditions at a
number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous wastes require cleanup
and other possible remedial action

    we also have a number of projects underway at several of our manufacturing
facilities in order to comply with environmental laws these projects relate to
a variety of activities including solvent and metal contamination clean up and
oil spill equipment upgrades and replacement these projects some of which are
voluntary and some of which are required under applicable law involve both
remediation expenses and capital improvements in addition we remain
responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations sold by
us

    the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the
uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation
of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods based upon
our experience with the foregoing environmental matters we have concluded that
there is at least a reasonable possibility that we will incur remedial costs in
the range of 1860 million to 4921 million as of september 30 2001 we
concluded that the best estimate within this range is 2685 million of which
2062 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and
623 million is included in other longterm liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet the increase in the environmental remediation reserve at
september 30 2001 compared to the 683 million reserve at september 30 2000
is due to the acquisition of mallinckrodt in view of our financial position and
reserves for environmental matters of 2685 million we have concluded that any
potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or
liquidity see item 3 businesslegal proceedings for a description of a

anticipated credit losses prepayment speeds and discount rates and are then
compared to the respective carrying values losses representing the excess of
carrying value over estimated current fair market value are recorded as
impairments and are recognized as a charge to operations unrealized gains are
not credited to current earnings but are reflected in shareholders equity as

1 summary of significant accounting policies continued

    financial instrumentseffective october 1 2000 the company adopted sfas
no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as
amended which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the
balance sheet at fair value and that changes in a derivatives fair value be
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met if the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge the changes in the fair value of
the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized as a charge or credit to earnings if the derivative is designated as
a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
derivative are recorded in other comprehensive loss income and are recognized
in the consolidated statement of operations when the hedged item affects
earnings ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges
are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings

    the fair value estimates are based on relevant market information including
current interest rates and information about the financial instrument assuming
adequate market liquidity fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding
future expected loss experience current economic conditions risk
characteristics of the financial instruments and other factors

    the company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign
currency commodity price and interest rate risks the companys objectives for
holding derivatives are to minimize these risks using the most effective methods
to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures the company documents
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links
derivatives designated as fair value cash flow or foreign currency hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet or to specific
firm commitments or forecasted transactions the company also assesses and
documents both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged
items

    as part of managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates the
company as an enduser enters into various interest rate swap transactions
all of which are transacted in overthecounter markets with other financial
institutions acting as principal counterparties to ensure both appropriate use
as a hedge and hedge accounting treatment all derivatives entered into are
designated according to a hedge objective against specified liabilities
including commercial paper or a specifically underwritten debt issue the
companys primary hedge objectives include the conversion of variablerate
liabilities to fixed rates and the conversion of fixedrate liabilities to
variable rates the derivatives associated with these objectives are classified
as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges respectively the notional amounts
rates indices and maturities of tyco capitals derivatives are required to
closely match the related terms of tyco capitals hedged liabilities

    the companys financial instruments present certain market and credit risks
however concentration of credit risk is mitigated as tyco deals with a variety
of major banks worldwide and its accounts receivable are spread among a number
of major industries customers and geographic areas none of the companys
financial instruments would result in a significant loss to the company if a
counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement the
company does not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the
counterparties to its financial instruments the company does however maintain
reserves for potential credit losses on financial instruments

    in connection with the acquisition of mallinckrodt the company obtained an
appraisal from an independent appraiser of the fair value of its intangible
assets this appraisal valued purchased inprocess research and development
iprd of various projects for the development of new products and
technologies at 1843 million the purchased iprd was written off during the
quarter ended december 31 2000 the value of the purchased iprd was based on
the value of the various projects utilizing the discounted cash flow method
this valuation included consideration of i the stage of completion of each of
the projects ii the technological feasibility of each of the projects
iii whether the projects had an alternative future use and iv the estimated
future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and
technologies over their respective projected economic lives

    as of the mallinckrodt acquisition date there were several projects under
development at different stages of completion the primary basis for determining
the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining food and drug
administration fda approval as of the acquisition date none of the iprd
projects had received fda approval in assessing the technological feasibility
of a project consideration was also given to the level of complexity and future
technological hurdles that each project had to overcome prior to being submitted
to the fda for approval as of the acquisition date none of the iprd projects
was considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future
use

    future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects
were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected
profitability of the various products and technologies involved these projected
cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account
managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the
projects to completion the discount rates include a rate of return which
accounts for the time value of money as well as risk factors that reflect the
economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized the cash flows
were discounted at discount rates ranging from 14 to 25 per annum depending
on the projects stage of completion and the type of fda approval needed this
discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the
purchased iprd resulted in a total valuation of 1843 million

interests include interestonly strips retained subordinated securities and
cash reserve accounts related to securitizations the carrying value of the
retained interests in securitized assets is reviewed at least quarterly for
valuation impairment

    the securitization programs cover a wide range of products and collateral
types with significantly different prepayment and credit risk characteristics

rate cpr which expresses payments as a function of the declining amount of
loans at a compound annual rate expected credit losses are based upon annual
loss rates the key economic assumptions used in measuring the retained
interests at the date of securitization for transactions completed during the

    these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution
changes in fair value based on a 10 percent variation in assumptions generally
cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to
the change in fair value may not be linear also in this table the effect of a
variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated without changing any other assumption in reality changes in one
factor may result in changes in another for example increases in market

holds these receivables and sells participating interests in such accounts
receivable to financiers who in turn purchase and receive ownership and
security interests in those receivables as collections reduce accounts
receivable included in the pool the operating subsidiaries sell new receivables
to the limited purpose subsidiary the limited purpose subsidiary has the risk
of credit loss on the receivables and accordingly the full amount of the
allowance for doubtful accounts has been retained on the consolidated balance
sheets the availability under the program is 500 million at september 30
2001 and 2000 466 million and 450 million respectively was utilized under
the program the proceeds from the sales were used to reduce borrowings under
tigs commercial paper program and are reported as operating cash flows in the
consolidated statements of cash flows the proceeds of sale are less than the
face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximates the cost
that the limited purpose subsidiary would incur if it were to issue commercial
paper backed by these accounts receivable the discount from the face amount is
accounted for as a loss on the sale of receivables and has been included in
selling general administrative and other costs and expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations such discount aggregated 253 million
257 million and 157 million or 53 66 and 56 of the

assets primarily property plant and equipment and related goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable
impairment losses are recognized when the fair value is less than the assets

undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business the net book value of the
underlying assets is adjusted to fair value if the sum of expected future
undiscounted cash flows is less than book value fair values are based on quoted
market prices and assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated
future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of
perceived risk

tyco industrial

    tyco industrial is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup
related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites the ultimate
cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding
the extent of the required cleanup the interpretation of applicable laws and
regulations and alternative cleanup methods based upon tyco industrials
experience with environmental remediation matters tyco industrial has concluded
that there is at least a reasonable possibility that we will incur remedial
costs in the range of 1860 million to 4921 million as of september 30
2001 tyco industrial concluded that the best estimate within this range is
2685 million of which 2062 million is included in accrued expenses and
other current liabilities and 623 million is included in other longterm
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet the increase in the environmental
remediation reserve at september 30 2001 compared to the 683 million reserve
at september 30 2000 is due to the acquisition of mallinckrodt in view of the
companys financial position and reserves for environmental matters of
2685 million the company has concluded that any potential payment of such
estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
position results of operations or liquidity

    in the normal course of meeting the financing needs of its customers tyco
capital enters into various creditrelated commitments these financial
instruments generate fees and involve to varying degrees elements of credit
risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet to
minimize potential credit risk tyco capital generally requires collateral and
other creditrelated terms and conditions from the customer it is tyco
capitals policy that at the time creditrelated commitments are granted the
fair value of the underlying collateral and guarantee must approximate or exceed
the contractual amount of the commitment in the event a customer defaults on
the underlying transaction the maximum potential loss to tyco capital will be
the contractual amount outstanding less the value of all underlying collateral
and guarantees

reporting structure such that the operations of the former flow control products
and services segment are now reported in part within the fire and security
services and in part within the electronics segments the company has conformed
its segment reporting accordingly and has reclassified comparative prior period
information to reflect this change

1  this amount is the sum of the operating income of tyco industrials four
     business segments set forth in the segment discussion below less certain
    corporate expenses and is before merger restructuring and other
    nonrecurring charges credits the writeoff of purchased inprocess
    research and development charges for the impairment of longlived assets
    amortization of goodwill and the adoption of sab 101 merger restructuring
    and other nonrecurring charges net in the amount of 1849 million
    10 million and 1064 million related to inventory have been deducted as
    part of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for
    fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively however they have not been
    deducted as part of cost of revenue for the purpose of calculating operating
    income before certain charges credits in this table these charges are
    instead included in merger restructuring and other nonrecurring charges

    during fiscal 2001 we recorded merger restructuring and other
nonrecurring charges and charges for the impairment of longlived assets
related primarily to cost reduction actions and acquisitions under our
restructuring and integration programs we terminate employees and close
facilities made redundant the reduction in manpower and facilities comes from
the manufacturing sales and administrative functions in addition we
discontinue or dispose of product lines which do not fit the longterm strategy
of the respective businesses we do not separately track the impact on financial
results of the restructuring and integration programs however we estimate that
our overall cost structure has been reduced by approximately 3000 million on
an annualized basis due to the impact associated with these charges the
significant decreases have been to selling general and administrative expenses
and to cost of revenue

    operating income and margins for tyco industrials four business segments
which are presented in accordance with gaap in the following discussion are
supplemented by a discussion of operating income and margins stated before
deductions for merger restructuring and other nonrecurring charges charges
for impairment of longlived assets and the adoption of sab 101 this
supplemental discussion of operating results before certain charges credits
and accounting change should not be considered an alternative to operating or
net income as an indicator of the performance of our business or as an
alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity
in each case determined in accordance with gaap

    operating income before certain charges credits and accounting change
improved in all segments in each of fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 with the
exception of the telecommunications segment as discussed below the operating
improvements are the result of both increased revenues in all but our
telecommunications segment and enhanced margins in all but our healthcare and
specialty products segment increased revenues resulted from acquisitions that
are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and from organic
growth we enhanced our margins through improved productivity and cost
reductions in the ordinary course of business unrelated to acquisition or
divestiture activities we regard charges that we incurred to reduce costs in
the ordinary course of business as recurring charges which are reflected in
cost of revenue and in selling general administrative and other costs and
expenses in the consolidated statements of operations

    when we make an acquisition the acquired company is immediately integrated
with our existing operations consequently we do not separately track the
financial results of acquired companies the discussions following the tables
below include estimates of yeartoyear revenue growth that exclude the effects
of indicated acquisitions these estimates assume that the acquisitions were
made at the beginning of the relevant fiscal periods

    the 143 increase in revenue before accounting change in fiscal 2001 over
fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from acquisitions these acquisitions included
siemens electromechanical components gmbh  co kg siemens and afc cable
systems inc afc cable in november 1999 praegitzer industries inc
praegitzer in december 1999 critchley group plc critchley in
march 2000 the electronic oem business of thomas  betts in july 2000 cigi
investment group inc cigi in october 2000 and lucent technologies power
systems business unit in december 2000 excluding the impact of these
acquisitions revenue increased an estimated 03 which reflects an economic
slowdown in the computer and consumer electronics and communications industries
and to a lesser extent the effect of foreign exchange rates

    the 621 increase in revenue in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 was
predominantly due to acquisitions and to a lesser extent organic growth these
acquisitions included glynwed international plc in march 1999 raychem
corporation raychem in august 1999 siemens and afc cable in november 1999
praegitzer in december 1999 critchley in march 2000 and the electronic oem
business of thomas  betts in july 2000 excluding the impact of these
acquisitions revenue increased an estimated 131

    the 200 increase in operating income and the increase in margins before
certain charges credits and accounting change in fiscal 2001 compared with
fiscal 2000 was primarily due to acquisitions and improved margins at both tyco
printed circuit group and amp these increases were somewhat offset by decreased
operating income and margins at allied tube and conduit resulting from higher
raw material prices

    operating income and margins after certain charges credits and accounting
change include restructuring and other nonrecurring and impairment charges of
4850 million partially offset by an increase of 225 million relating to the
adoption of sab 101 in fiscal 2001 as compared to a net merger restructuring
and other nonrecurring credit of 909 million in fiscal 2000

    the substantial increase in operating income and margins before certain
charges credits in fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999 was primarily due to
the acquisitions of raychem and siemens and improved margins at both amp and
tyco printed circuit group the improved operating margins before certain
charges credits in fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999 resulted from
increased volume improved pricing and continuing cost reduction programs
following the amp merger

    in addition to the items discussed above the substantial increase in
operating income and margins after certain charges credits was due to a
merger restructuring and other nonrecurring net credit of 909 million in
fiscal 2000 compared with a restructuring and other nonrecurring charge of
10748 million in fiscal 1999

    the 238 increase in revenue before accounting change in fiscal 2001 over
fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from higher sales volume and increased service
revenue in fire protection in north america and asia and higher revenues in the
worldwide electronic security services business the increases were due
primarily to a higher volume of recurring service revenues and to a lesser
extent the effects of acquisitions these acquisitions included flow control
technologies fct in february 2000 simplex time recorder co in

security systems businesses of cambridge protection industries llc
securitylink in july 2001 excluding the impact of these acquisitions
revenue increased an estimated 99

recurring service revenues and to a lesser extent the effects of acquisitions
in the security services business these acquisitions included entergy security
corporation in january 1999 alarmguard holdings in february 1999 central
sprinkler corporation in august 1999 and fct in february 2000 in august 1999
we sold certain businesses within this segment including the mueller company
and portions of grinnell supply sales and manufacturing excluding the impact of
these acquisitions and divestitures revenue increased an estimated 119

    the 379 increase in operating income before certain charges credits and
accounting change in fiscal 2001 over fiscal 2000 was primarily due to
acquisitions and increased service volume in the fire protection business in
north america and asia and worldwide security business the increase in
operating margins before certain charges credits and accounting change was
primarily due to increased service revenues in fire protection and improved
margins at both the valve operations and at tyco infrastructure formerly known
as earth tech

    operating income and margins after certain charges credits and accounting
change include restructuring and other nonrecurring and impairment charges of
1449 million as well as a decrease of 1838 million relating to the adoption
of sab 101 in fiscal 2001 as compared to a restructuring and other
nonrecurring credit of 112 million in fiscal 2000 as required under
sab 101 we modified our revenue recognition policies with respect to the
installation of electronic security systems as of the beginning of the fiscal
year see consolidated itemscumulative effect of accounting changes

    the 118 increase in operating income before certain charges credits in
fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 reflects increased service volume in security
operations in the united states and fire protection businesses in north america
and asia the increase in operating margins before certain credits was due to
increased sales volume in both security services and fire protection offset
slightly in the case of security services by the costs of the reorganization
of the security services dealer program and internal sales force during the
first two quarters of fiscal 2000

    in addition to the items discussed above operating income and margins
after certain charges credits reflect restructuring and other nonrecurring
credits of 112 million in fiscal 2000 and 272 million in fiscal 1999

change include restructuring and other nonrecurring and impairment charges of
2564 million as well as a decrease of 98 million relating to the adoption
of sab 101 in fiscal 2001 as compared to net merger restructuring and other
nonrecurring and impairment charges of 881 million in fiscal 2000

    the 102 increase in operating income before certain charges credits and
accounting change in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 was due to increased sales
volume at tyco healthcare tyco plastics and adhesives and to a lesser extent
adt automotive slightly offset by a lower operating margin percentage at tyco
healthcare principally due to higher raw materials costs

    in addition to the items discussed above the substantial increase in
operating income and margins after certain charges credits in fiscal 2000
over fiscal 1999 was due to net merger restructuring and other nonrecurring
and impairment charges of 881 million in fiscal 2000 compared with net merger
restructuring and other nonrecurring charges of 4951 million in fiscal 1999

    since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 when we began construction of the
transatlantic portion of the tgn tycoms revenues have decreased due to lower
thirdparty contract sales while fixed costs have generally increased due to
our building the infrastructure to support the tgn including network
operations sales and marketing research and development and administration
the 266 decrease in revenue in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 reflects
generally the downturn in the telecommunications industry and specifically a
decrease in thirdparty contract sales for undersea communication systems in
addition certain revenues were deferred pending customer financing tycom may
continue to experience softness in demand if the current downturn in the
telecommunications industry continues however tycom believes that its
technological capabilities and contraction in the number of competitors should
mitigate the negative effects of industry trends on its results in the longer
term

    the 564 increase in revenue in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 resulted
primarily from increased demand for thirdparty sales of undersea communications
systems and to a much lesser extent the acquisition in may 1999 of
telecomunicaciones marinas sa temasa excluding the effect of temasa the
revenue increase for the segment in fiscal 2000 was an estimated 540

    the 217 decrease in operating income before certain charges in fiscal
2001 compared with fiscal 2000 was principally due to the decrease in the volume
of undersea cable communications systems sales and services to others the
increase in operating margins was primarily due to project completions and
certain reduced accruals due to lower profitability levels for fiscal 2001 and
certain contractual settlements

    the substantial increase in operating income before and after certain
charges in fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999 was primarily due to higher
sales volume and to a lesser extent the temasa acquisition the increase in
operating income after certain charges was offset by a nonrecurring charge of
131 million incurred in connection with the tycom initial public offering

foreign currency

    the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for fiscal 2001 compared to
fiscal 2000 was a decrease in revenue of approximately 10536 million and a
decrease in operating income of approximately 1995 million the effect of
changes in foreign exchange rates for fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was a
decrease in revenue of approximately 5286 million and a decrease in operating
income of approximately 1059 million

corporate expenses

    corporate expenses excluding a net gain on sale of businesses and
investments of 2766 million a net nonrecurring credit of 1634 million
primarily for the settlement of litigation and a net gain of 641 million on
the sale of common shares of a subsidiary were 1919 million in fiscal 2001 as
compared to 1874 million in fiscal 2000 and 1229 million in fiscal 1999
these increases were due principally to higher compensation expense under our
equitybased incentive compensation plans and an increase in corporate staffing
and related costs to support and monitor our expanding businesses and
operations

amortization of goodwill

    amortization of goodwill a noncash charge increased 1930 million to
5374 million in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000 fiscal 2000
amortization of goodwill increased to 3444 million from 2161 million in
fiscal 1999 the increases in goodwill amortization expenses were due to net
increases in goodwill balances of 100662 million in fiscal 2001 and
37644 million in fiscal 2000 all due to acquisitions in accordance with
recently adopted accounting rule changes goodwill will no longer be amortized
beginning with our fiscal 2002 year see accounting and technical pronouncements
within note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these
accounting rule changes

interest expense net

    interest expense net increased 69 million to 7765 million in fiscal
2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 and increased 2840 million to
7696 million in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 these increases were
due primarily to higher average debt balances resulting from borrowings to
finance acquisitions and our share repurchase program offset by lower interest
rates during fiscal 2001 the increase in borrowings was mitigated in part by
the generation of a substantial amount of free cash flow the weightedaverage
rates of interest on tyco industrials longterm debt outstanding at
september 30 2001 and 2000 were 42 and 66 respectively

consolidated items

consolidated income tax expense

    the effective income tax rate excluding the impact of purchased inprocess
research and development merger restructuring and other nonrecurring
charges credits charges for the impairment of longlived assets net gain on
the sale of businesses and investments net gain on the sale of common shares of
a subsidiary and accounting change was 230 during fiscal 2001 as compared to
248 in fiscal 2000 and 270 in fiscal 1999 the decrease in the effective
income tax rate was primarily due to higher earnings in tax jurisdictions with
lower income tax rates we believe that we will generate sufficient future
income to realize the tax benefits related to our deferred tax assets a
valuation allowance has been maintained due to continued uncertainties of
realization of certain tax benefits primarily tax loss carryforwards see note
9 to our consolidated financial statements

extraordinary items

    extraordinary items in fiscal 2001 fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 included
aftertax losses amounting to 171 million 02 million and 457 million
respectively relating primarily to the early extinguishment of debt see note
17 to our consolidated financial statements

cumulative effect of accounting changes

    in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission sec issued
sab 101 in which the sec staff expressed its views regarding the appropriate
recognition of revenue in a variety of circumstances some of which are relevant
to us as required under sab 101 we modified our revenue recognition policies
with respect to the installation of electronic security systems see revenue
recognition within note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in
addition in response to sab 101 we undertook a review of our revenue
recognition practices and identified certain provisions included in a limited
number of sales arrangements that delayed the recognition of revenue under
sab 101 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we changed our method of
accounting for these items retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year to
conform to the requirements of sab 101 this was reported as a 6537 million
aftertax 10056 million pretax charge for the cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle in the fiscal 2001 consolidated statement of operations

    the impact of sab 101 on total revenues in fiscal 2001 was a net decrease of
2411 million reflecting the deferral of 5205 million of fiscal 2001
revenues partially offset by the recognition of 2794 million of revenue that
is included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the
fiscal year we restated each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2001 in the
consolidated statement of operations to reflect the adoption of sab 101 see
note 29 to our consolidated financial statements pro forma amounts for the
periods prior to fiscal 2001 have not been presented since the effect of the
change in accounting principle for these periods could not be reasonably
determined

    we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment a 297 million loss net of
tax in fiscal 2001 in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas
no 133 see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements

    22477 million and 1111 million for the years ended september 30 2001
    and 2000 respectively this amount includes 4277 million and
    1720 million received in saleleaseback transactions for the years ended
    september 30 2001 and 2000 respectively

    in addition in fiscal 2001 fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 we paid out
7372 million 5442 million and 3544 million respectively in cash that
was charged against reserves established in connection with acquisitions
accounted for under the purchase accounting method this amount is included in
acquisition of businesses net of cash acquired in the consolidated statements
of cash flows

    reserves for restructuring and other nonrecurring items are taken as a
charge against current earnings at the time the reserves are established
amounts expended for restructuring and other nonrecurring costs are charged
against the reserves as they are paid out if the amount of the reserves proves
to be greater than the costs actually incurred any excess is credited against
restructuring and other nonrecurring charges in the consolidated statement of
operations in the period in which that determination is made

    in fiscal 2001 we recorded net restructuring and other nonrecurring
charges of 3318 million of which charges of 982 million are included in
cost of revenue consisting of charges of 4986 million related primarily to
the closure of manufacturing plants sales offices warehouses and
administrative offices in the electronics and fire and security services

credit to litigation reserves established in the prior year in addition we
incurred a nonrecurring charge of 867 million related to the sale of
inventory which had been writtenup under purchase accounting which has been
included in cost of revenue at september 30 2000 there existed merger
restructuring and other nonrecurring reserves of 3659 million during fiscal
2001 we paid out 2155 million in cash and incurred 2287 million in noncash
charges that were charged against these reserves at september 30 2001 there
remained 3402 million of merger restructuring and other nonrecurring
reserves on tyco industrials consolidated balance sheet of which
3049 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and
353 million is included in other longterm liabilities

    all business combinations completed in fiscal 2001 were accounted for under
the purchase accounting method at the time each purchase acquisition is made
we establish a reserve for transaction costs and the costs of integrating the
purchased company within the relevant tyco business segment the amounts of such
reserves established in fiscal 2001 are detailed in note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements these amounts are not charged against current earnings but
are treated as additional purchase price consideration and have the effect of
increasing the amount of goodwill recorded in connection with the respective
acquisition we view these costs as the equivalent of additional purchase price
consideration when we consider making an acquisition if the amount of the
reserves proves to be in excess of costs actually incurred any excess is used
to reduce the goodwill account that was established at the time the acquisition
was made

    in fiscal 2001 tyco industrial made acquisitions that were accounted for
under the purchase accounting method at an aggregate cost of 147415 million
of this amount 109566 million was paid in cash net of cash acquired
excluding 21564 million of cash acquired from tyco capital and
37849 million was paid in the form of tyco common shares debt of acquired
companies aggregated 15923 million in connection with these acquisitions we
established purchase accounting reserves of 10213 million for transaction and
integration costs in addition purchase accounting liabilities of
1037 million and a corresponding increase to goodwill and deferred tax assets
were recorded during fiscal 2001 changes in estimates related to acquisitions
consummated prior to fiscal 2001 primarily related to revisions associated with
finalizing the exit plans of the electronic oem business of thomas  betts afc
cable critchley and siemens all acquired during fiscal 2000 at the beginning
of fiscal 2001 purchase accounting reserves were 3726 million as a result of
purchase accounting transactions made in prior years during fiscal 2001 we
paid out 8944 million in cash including approximately 1057 million relating
to purchase price adjustments and earnout liabilities on certain acquisitions
and 515 million relating to the acquisition of tyco capital and incurred
72 million in noncash charges against the reserves established during and
prior to fiscal 2001 also in fiscal 2001 we determined that 689 million of
purchase accounting reserves related primarily to acquisitions prior to fiscal
2001 were not needed and reversed that amount against goodwill at
september 30 2001 there remained 7021 million in purchase accounting
reserves on tyco industrials consolidated balance sheet of which
5831 million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and
1190 million is included in other longterm liabilities

    we continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of
our businesses to invest in new processes and technology and to maintain high
quality production standards the level of capital expenditures for the fire and
security services segment significantly exceeded and is expected to continue to
significantly exceed depreciation due to the substantial growth in the number
of new security system installations the level of capital expenditures in the
other segments is expected to increase moderately in fiscal 2002 during fiscal
2001 tycom spent 22477 million on construction of the tgn we expect our
expenditures on construction of the tgn to be approximately 15000 million in
fiscal 2002 the source of funds for capital expenditures and construction of
the tgn is expected to be cash from operating activities

    the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations
for fiscal 2001 was 12849 million but the amount of income taxes paid net
of refunds during the year was 7229 million the difference is due to timing
differences as well as the tax benefits related to the exercise of share
options the current income tax liability at september 30 2001 was
18450 million as compared to 16503 million at september 30 2000

    the net change in working capital net of the effects of acquisitions and
divestitures was an increase of 4660 million in fiscal 2001 the components
of this change are set forth in detail in tyco industrials consolidated
statement of cash flows the increase in working capital accounts is
attributable to the higher level of business activity in fiscal 2001 as
reflected in the increased revenue over the prior year we focus on maximizing
the cash flow from our operating businesses and attempt to keep the working
capital employed in the businesses to the minimum level required for efficient
operations

    during fiscal 2001 we used 13261 million to repurchase our own common
shares under our ongoing share buyback program we repurchase our own shares
from time to time in the open market to satisfy certain stockbased compensation
arrangements such as the exercise of share options or to use for acquisitions

    during fiscal 2001 tyco sold 39 million common shares for approximately
21980 million in an underwritten public offering net proceeds from the
offering were 21966 million and were used to repay debt incurred to finance a
portion of the acquisition of cit

    during fiscal 2001 we received proceeds of 5450 million from the exercise
of common share options in addition during fiscal 2001 we received proceeds
of 9044 million net of cash sold primarily from the sale of our adt
automotive business

    the source of the cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2001 was primarily
through the issuance of debt free cash flow the sale of common shares and
proceeds on the sale of businesses goodwill and other intangible assets were
287409 million at september 30 2001 compared to 163326 million at
september 30 2000 at september 30 2001 tyco industrials total debt was
216190 million as compared to 109990 million at september 30 2000 this
increase resulted principally from net proceeds of approximately
33740 million and 22034 million from the sale of zero coupon convertible
debentures due 2020 and 2021 respectively 19821 million from the sale of
notes due 2006 and 2011 17879 million from the sale of notes due 2003 and
2006 and borrowings under tyco international group sas tig commercial
paper program for a full discussion of debt activity see note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements

    shareholders equity was 317374 million or 1640 per share at
september 30 2001 compared to 170332 million or 1011 per share at
september 30 2000 the increase in shareholders equity was due primarily to
the issuance of approximately 2112 million common shares valued at
104353 million for the acquisitions of mallinckrodt and cigi in
october 2000 innerdyne in december 2000 scott in may 2001 and cit in
june 2001 net income of 39706 million and the sale of 39 million common
shares for net proceeds of 21966 million as discussed above this increase
was partially offset by the repurchase of our common shares for approximately
13261 million and an unrealized loss on available for sale securities of
12679 million total debt as a percent of total

2001 and 39 at september 30 2000 net debt total debt less cash and cash
equivalents as a percent of total capitalization was 37 at september 30 2001
and 35 at september 30 2000

    on october 26 2001 tig sold 15000 million 6375 notes due 2011 under
its 60 billion shelf registration statement in a public offering the notes
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by tyco the net proceeds of
approximately 14878 million were used to repay borrowings under tigs
commercial paper program

    on november 13 2001 tyco completed the acquisition of sensormatic
electronics corporation sensormatic a leading supplier of electronic
security solutions to the retail commercial and industrial marketplaces the
acquisition is valued at approximately 23 billion including the assumption of
116 million of net debt an aggregate of approximately 48 million common shares
of tyco were issued in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of
sensormatic

    on november 19 2001 tig issued e500 million 4375 notes due 2005 e685
million 55 notes due 2009 l200 million 65 notes due 2012 and l285 million
65 notes due 2032 utilizing the capacity available under tigs european
medium term note programme established in september 2001 the notes are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by tyco the net proceeds of 17266 million
were used to repay borrowings under tigs commercial paper program

    on december 18 2001 we completed our amalgamation with tycom and each of
the approximately 56 million tycom common shares not owned by tyco were
converted into the right to receive 03133 of a tyco common share upon
completion of the amalgamation tycom became a whollyowned subsidiary of tyco

    we believe that our cash flow from tyco industrials operations together
with our existing credit facilities and other credit arrangements is adequate
to fund tyco industrials operations

tyco industrial backlog

    at september 30 2001 tyco industrial had a backlog of unfilled orders of
109991 million compared to a backlog of 104182 million as of
september 30 2000 we expect that approximately 76 of our backlog at
september 30 2001 will be filled during fiscal 2002 backlog by reportable
industry segment is as follows  in millions



                                                             september 30

    backlog for fire and security services includes recurring revenue in
force which represents one years fees for security monitoring and maintenance
services under contract the amount of backlog as of september 30 2000 has been
restated to include recurring revenue in force at that date of
22034 million the amount of recurring revenue in force at september 30 2001
is 30996 million within the fire and security services segment backlog
increased due to the following the deferral of 14535 million of net revenue
as a result of the adoption of sab 101 an increase in services contracts of the
security business an increase in contract bookings at tyco infrastructure and
to a lesser extent the effect of acquisitions

    within the electronics segment backlog decreased due to the cancellation
andor delay of orders by customers in certain endmarkets such as the computer
and consumer electronics and communications industries the decrease in backlog
within the telecommunications segment reflects

                                      104
page
generally the downturn in the telecommunications industry and specifically a
decrease in thirdparty contracts for undersea communications systems partially
offset by contracts signed for capacity sales on the tgn in addition a
7105 million contract previously booked was removed from backlog pending
customer financing the increase in backlog in healthcare and specialty products
is due to the deferral of 716 million of net revenue as a result of the
adoption of sab 101 backlog in the healthcare and specialty products segment
represents unfilled orders which in the nature of the business are normally
shipped shortly after purchase orders are received we do not view backlog in
the healthcare industry to be a significant indicator of the level of future
sales activity

tyco capital risk management

    tyco capitals business activities contain various elements of risk tyco
capital considers the principal types of risk to be credit risk including
credit collateral and equipment risk and market risk including interest rate
foreign currency and liquidity risk

credit risk management

    tyco capital has developed and maintains systems specifically designed to
manage credit risk in each of its business segments tyco capital evaluates
financing and leasing assets for credit and collateral risk during the credit
granting process and periodically after the advancement of funds

    each of tyco capitals strategic business units has developed and maintains
a formal credit management process in accordance with formal uniform guidelines
established by tyco capitals corporate credit risk management group these
guidelines set forth risk acceptance criteria for

     acceptable maximum credit line

     selected target markets and products

     creditworthiness of borrowers including credit history financial
      condition adequacy of cash flow and quality of management and

     the type and value of underlying collateral and guarantees including
      recourse from dealers and manufacturers

    tyco capital also employs a risk adjusted pricing process where the
perceived credit risk is a factor in determining the interest rate andor fees
charged for its financing and leasing products as economic and market
conditions change credit risk management practices are reviewed and modified
if necessary to seek to minimize the risk of credit loss

equipmentresidual risk management

    tyco capital has developed systems processes and expertise to manage the
equipment and residual risk in its commercial businesses the tyco capital
process consists of the following i residual setting

                                      108
page
and valuation at deal inception ii systematic residual reviews and
iii monitoring of residual realizations reviews for impairment are performed
at least annually residual realizations by business unit and product are
reviewed as part of tyco capitals ongoing financial and asset quality review
both within the business units and by corporate management

commercial

    tyco capital has developed systems specifically designed to effectively
manage credit risk in its commercial businesses the process starts with the
initial evaluation of credit risk and underlying collateral at the time of
origination and continues over the life of the finance receivable or operating
lease including collecting past due balances and liquidating underlying
collateral

consumer and smallticket leasing

    tyco capital has developed proprietary automated credit scoring models by
loan type that include both customer demographics and credit bureau
characteristics the profiles emphasize among other things occupancy status
length of residence length of employment debt to income ratio ratio of total
installment debt and housing expenses to gross monthly income bank account
references credit bureau information and combined loan to value ratio the
models are used to assess a potential borrowers credit standing and repayment
ability considering the value or adequacy of property offered as collateral
tyco capitals credit criteria include reliance on credit scores including
those based upon both its proprietary internal credit scoring model and external
credit bureau scoring combined with judgment

market risk management

    market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in values of financial
instruments including interest rate risk foreign exchange risk derivative
credit risk and liquidity risk tyco capital engages in transactions in the
normal course of business that expose it to market risks and maintains what it
believes are conservative management practices and policies designed to
effectively mitigate such risks the objectives of tyco capitals market risk
management efforts are to preserve company value by hedging changes in future
expected net cash flows and to decrease the cost of capital strategies for
managing market risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign
exchange rates are an integral part of the process because those strategies
affect tyco capitals future expected cash flows as well as its cost of
capital

interest rate and foreign exchange risk management

    tyco capital offers a variety of financing products to its customers
including fixed and floatingrate loans of various maturities and currency
denominations and a variety of leases including operating leases changes in
market interest rates or in the relationships between shortterm and longterm
market interest rates or in the relationships between different interest rate
indices ie basis risk can affect the interest rates charged on
interestearning assets differently than the interest rates paid on
interestbearing liabilities which can result in an increase in interest
expense relative to finance income tyco capital measures its assetliability
position in economic terms through duration measures and value at risk analysis
and measures its periodic effect on earnings using maturity gap analysis

    a substantially matched assetliability position is generally achieved
through a combination of financial instruments including issuing commercial
paper mediumterm notes longterm debt interest rate and currency swaps
foreign exchange contracts and through asset syndication and securitization
tyco capital does not speculate on interest rates or foreign exchange rates but
rather seeks to mitigate the possible impact of such rate fluctuations
encountered in the normal course of business this process is ongoing due to
prepayments refinancings and actual payments varying from contractual terms as
well as other portfolio dynamics

                                      109
page
    tyco capital periodically enters into structured financings involving both
the issuance of debt and an interest rate swap with corresponding notional
principal amount and maturity to manage liquidity and reduce interest rate risk
at a lower overall funding cost than could be achieved by solely issuing debt

    interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of 69 billion at
september 30 2001 were designated as hedges against outstanding debt and were
principally used to convert the interest rate on variablerate debt to a
fixedrate establishing a fixedrate term debt borrowing cost for the life of
the swap these hedges reduce tyco capitals exposure to rising interest rates
but also reduce the benefits from lower interest rates

    tyco capitals foreign operations include canada latin america europe
asia and australia and are funded through both local currency borrowings and
us dollar borrowings which are converted to local currency through the use of
foreign exchange forward contracts or crosscurrency swaps at september 30
2001 25 billion in notional principal amount of foreign exchange forwards and
17 billion in notional principal amount of crosscurrency swaps were
designated as currencyrelated debt hedges

    tyco capital also utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its
net investments in foreign operations translation gains and losses of the
underlying foreign net investment as well as offsetting derivative gains or
losses on designated hedges are reflected in other comprehensive income at
september 30 2001 08 billion in notional principal of foreign exchange
forwards were designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations

derivative risk management

    tyco capital enters into interest rate and currency swaps and foreign
exchange forward contracts as part of its overall market risk management
practices

    the primary external risk of derivative instruments is counterparty credit
exposure which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its
financial obligations under a derivative contract tyco capital controls the
credit risk of its derivative agreements through counterparty credit approvals
preestablished exposure limits and monitoring procedures

liquidity risk management

    liquidity risk refers to the risk of tyco capital being unable to meet
potential cash outflows promptly and cost effectively factors that could cause
such a risk to arise might be a disruption of a securities market or the
unavailability of funds tyco capital actively manages and mitigates liquidity
risk by maintaining diversified sources of funding the primary funding sources
are commercial paper us canada and australia mediumterm notes us
canada and europe and assetbacked securities us and canada included as
part of tyco capitals securitization programs are committed assetbacked
commercial paper programs in the us and canada tyco capital also maintains
committed bank lines of credit to provide backstop support of commercial paper
borrowings and local bank lines to support our international operations
additional sources of liquidity are loan and lease payments from customers
whole loan asset sales and loan syndications
