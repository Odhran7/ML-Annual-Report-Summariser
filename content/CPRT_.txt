overview 

we are a leading global provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states “us” canada the united kingdom “uk” brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates “uae” oman bahrain and spain 

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us with respect to our environmental stewardship we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global reuse and recycling of vehicles parts and raw materials we are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers each vehicle that enters our business operations already exists with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacture have already occurred however upon our receipt of an existing vehicle we help decrease its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing for example many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to driveable condition reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs 

table of contents 

again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing and finally some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping reducing the need for further new resource extraction in each of these cases our business reduces the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry 

beyond our environmental stewardship we also support the world’s communities in two important ways first we believe that we contribute to economic development and wellbeing by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world for example many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education health care and wellbeing more generally secondly because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve for example we mobilized our people entered into emergency leases and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve store and remarket tens of thousands of flooddamaged vehicles in the new york metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane ida in the fall of 2021 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers vehicle rental companies and individuals we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland finland the uae oman and bahrain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction such as delivery and storage in the uk germany and spain we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured 

through our vb3 auction platform our sales process is open to registered buyers whom we refer to as “members” anywhere in the world with access to the internet this technology and model employ a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows members to enter bids over the internet during the preview period to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb3 system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb3’s bid4u feature incrementally bids on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe our virtual auction platform increases the pool of available buyers for each sale which brings added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improves the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements which would be associated with holding live auctions 

for fiscal 2022 sales of us vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 661 of total vehicles sold of which 297 of vehicles were sold to out of state members within the us and 364 were sold to international members based on the ip address utilized during the auction process 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

• providing coverage that facilitates seller access to buyers around the world reducing towing and thirdparty storage expenses offering a local presence for vehicle inspection stations and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by specially trained teams 

• providing a comprehensive range of services that includes merchandising efficient title processing timely pickup and delivery of vehicles and internet sales

• establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions 

• increasing the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and convenience of internet bidding 

• applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through internet bidding webbased order processing salvage value quotes electronic communication with members and sellers and vehicle imaging 

historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in the amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both members and sellers and v growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal 2022 our revenues were 35 billion and our operating income was 14 billion

our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own we have certain contracts with insurance companies primarily in the uk in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent vehicle transportation insurance property related taxes fuel equipment maintenance and repair marketing costs directly related to the auction process and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel professional services marketing expenses and system maintenance and enhancements 

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price occasionally companies in our industry purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based on the vehicles’ estimated preaccident value “pav” and the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and released to the buyer while companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction or a hybrid internet and physical auction we sell virtually all our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers vehicle rental companies and individuals our primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

table of contents 

the primary buyers of vehicles at our auctions are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers based on volume of vehicles purchased either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

most of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident or a natural disaster typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its pav the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the pav less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer and navigation systems advanced cameras including backup camera systems collision warning systems dynamic cruise control lane departure warning systems automatic braking blind spot detection systems and electrification of drivetrains we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

• the anticipated percentage return on salvage ie gross salvage proceeds minus vehicle handling and selling expenses divided by the pav 

• the services provided by the company and the degree to which such services reduce their administrative costs and expenses 

• the price the company charges for its services 

• geographic coverage 

• the ability to respond to natural disasters 

• the ability to provide analytical data to the seller and 

• in the uk in certain situations the actual amount paid for the vehicle 

in the uk some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles under these circumstances insurance companies will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order or the assignment we arrange for the transportation of a vehicle to our nearest facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

table of contents 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations although we may offer transportation services to obtain the vehicle at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold at auction on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member typically seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller

sales 

we process vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle sellers no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022 2021 or 2020 and our business does not depend on any particular customer to remain profitable we obtained 80 77 and 81 of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively from insurance company sellers 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle sellers the agreements are customized to each vehicle seller’s needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle seller in a designated geographic area 

we market our services to vehicle sellers through an inhouse sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques including personal sales calls internet search engines employee referrals tow shop referrals and participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions targeted mailing of our sales literature and telemarketing we market our services to franchise and independent dealerships as well as the general public we may when appropriate provide vehicle sellers with detailed analysis of the net return on vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses

members 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered members “buyers” in the vehicle dismantling and recycling rebuilding used vehicle dealer and export industries as well as members that are a part of the general public where applicable we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing members with a variety of programs and services to become a registered member a person or business must complete a basic application either online or through our mobile application before any member may purchase a vehicle they must provide copies of current government issued photo identification additionally business members must provide current business information including copies of licenses which may include vehicle dismantler dealer resale repair or export licenses and as needed completed sales tax exemption certificates registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements we may sell to the general public either directly or members may purchase a vehicle offered at copart through a registered broker who meets local licensing and permitting requirements strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that will not result in a completed sale we market to members online and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing direct mail inlocation marketing search engines social media radio television trade publications and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles against these other vehicle remarketers we face competition for longterm contractual commitments and various supply agreements with sellers in addition to competition for the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in the us include insurance auto auctions inc “iaa” kar auction services inc “kar” including its subsidiary adesa inc manheim inc and acv auctions inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation “lkq” lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in our international markets our principal competitors are vehicle auction and sales companies vehicle dismantlers and privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary yard management information system consists of a series of ibm as400 mainframe computer systems and other servers which run our proprietary software developed to process salvage sales vehicles throughout the auction process this system is integrated with the internet to enable buyers to view salvage vehicles and bid on them it can also be integrated with the seller’s system and enables the sellers to monitor their vehicles and analyze the progression of vehicles through the

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to international federal provincial state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities requiring us to actively monitor and manage potential environmental impacts in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations in addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions we also take such appropriate actions as may be necessary to avoid liability for activities of prior owners and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks there can be no assurances however that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities we have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us in addition to acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions we have also obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various international federal provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations that may impact our capital expenditures earnings and competitive position the acquisition and sale of vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and foreign motor vehicle departments and the steps required to process vehicle titles is a significant cost of our business at the same time our knowhow in the area of title processing is a competitive advantage in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities which generally make it more challenging and expensive to identify acquire and develop new facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by international federal provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in 2008 we obtained a patent issued by the united states patent and trademark office that covers certain aspects of our virtual bidding auction platform generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with certain of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents severe weather events including but not limited to tornadoes floods hurricanes and hailstorms can also impact our volumes 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

risks related to our business and industry 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

although no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022 2021 or 2020 a limited number of vehicle sellers historically have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected revenues in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside the us including expansions in europe brazil and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired or operational capabilities established outside the us could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside the us in fiscal 2003 with an acquisition in canada subsequently in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we made significant acquisitions in the uk followed by acquisitions in the uae brazil germany and spain in fiscal 2013 expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015 expansion into the republic of ireland and india in fiscal 2016 and an acquisition in finland in fiscal 2018 and a parts recycler in uk in fiscal 2022 in addition we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside of the us acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside of the us pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards and operations acquiring buyers and sellers and implementing shared services capabilities in international markets among other things we plan to ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an 

table of contents 

adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally for example although we continue to operate a technology and operations center in india for administrative support we decided to suspend our salvage operations in india in fiscal 2018 until the indian market develops in a manner better suited to our business model which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results moreover success in opening and operating facilities in new markets can be dependent upon establishing new relationships with buyers and sellers and our failure to establish those relationships could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

• the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices 

• the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations 

• the need to localize our mix of product and service offerings in response to customer requirements particularly the need to implement our online auction platform in foreign countries 

• the need to comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations 

• tariffs trade barriers trade disputes and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets 

• exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and revenue growth rates 

• adapting to different business cultures languages and market structures particularly where we seek to implement our auction model in markets where insurers have historically not played a substantial role in the disposition of salvage vehicles 

• repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us which may result in higher effective tax rates 

• military conflicts including the russian invasion of ukraine 

• public health issues including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic 

• environmental issues 

• natural and manmade disasters and 

• political issues 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet and other points of access while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in the us canada and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

for example we implemented our online system across all of our us canada and uk salvage yards between in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in those markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in the us canada and the uk however we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to maintain sufficient capacity to accept additional vehicles at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricane ida had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of complementary businesses additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2020 we opened two new operational facilities in germany one new operational facility in brazil and three new operational facilities in the us in fiscal 2021 we opened one new operational facility in germany one new operational facility in spain ten new operational facilities in the us and acquired an operational facility in des moines iowa in fiscal 2022 we opened one new operational facility in canada one new operational facility in spain and five new operational facilities in the us as for strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses we acquired national powersport auctions in fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2022 we acquired hills motors “hills” a used or “green” parts recycler in the uk that has four operating facilities the hills acquisition is currently undergoing review by the cma acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

• continue to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms 

• expand existing facilities in nogrowth regulatory environments 

• obtain or retain buyers sellers and sales volumes in new markets or facilities 

• increase revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities 

• maintain the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions 

• create new vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and profitability requirements or 

• obtain necessary regulatory approvals under applicable antitrust and competition laws 

table of contents 

in addition certain of the acquisition agreements under which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

• hire train and manage additional qualified personnel 

• establish new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle sellers 

• identify and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms 

• secure adequate capital 

• identify productive uses for available capital reserves and 

• maintain the supply of vehicles from vehicle sellers 

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely primarily upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the us and the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our storage facilities in those geographies in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including but not limited to inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure accidents and related injury claims availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have initiated and intend to continue to initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and copart lounge programs through which registered members can open copart storefronts in foreign markets with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public will involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived these programs could also create additional risks including heightened regulation and litigation risk related to vehicle sales to the general public and heightened branding reputational and intellectual property risk associated with allowing copart registered members to establish copartbranded storefronts in foreign jurisdictions 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle supply only a portion of which are referred to as inventory which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our salvage vehicle supply will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly 

table of contents 

dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2022 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricane ida weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory and included premiums for subhaulers payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman and a jayson adair and jeffrey liaw our cochief executive officers or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

more generally our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain a talented workforce the labor market is highly competitive and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain talented personnel in our organization at appropriate staffing levels in addition because our core technology platform is internally developed we face heightened risks relating to workforce recruitment and retention of key personnel with subject matter expertise relating to our technology platform 

the vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage and other vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may currently or in the future have greater financial resources than we do due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk and other foreign markets the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

risks related to regulatory compliance and legal matters 

our business activities and public policy interests expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

our business activities facilities expansions and civic and public policy interests may be unpopular in certain communities exposing us to reputational and political risk for example public opposition in some communities to different aspects of our business operations has impacted our ability to obtain required business use permits additionally our interests in legislative and regulatory processes at different levels of government in the geographies in which we operate have been opposed by competitors and other interest groups although we believe we generally enjoy positive community relationships and political support in our range of operations shifting public opinion sentiments and sociopolitical dynamics could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

table of contents 

our operations and acquisitions in the us and certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in some cases the enforcement practices of governmental regulators in certain foreign areas and the procedural and substantive rights and remedies available to us may vary significantly from those in the united states which could have an adverse effect on our business 

although we face risks associated with international expansion in each of the nonus markets where we operate our current focus on the german market heightens the risks we face relating to our expansion plans in germany 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not previously been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” uk bribery act brazil clean companies act india’s prevention of corruption act 1988 or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the cma if an inquiry is made by the cma we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the cma will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the cma determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the cma the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

we face risks associated with transacting on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks 

certain of the vehicles that we remarket in the us and foreign markets may be transacted either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased and then resold for our own account rather than the agency model in which we generally act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in the us canada and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets including germany insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of vehicles as we expand into markets outside the us canada and the uk including germany in particular we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

acquisitions typically will increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions to date most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and other obligations regarding privacy and data protection 

we are subject to federal state and international laws directives and regulations relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personal data these laws directives and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in the european union on may 25 2018 applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the european union and may also apply to related products and services that we offer to european union users similarly the california consumer privacy act or ab375 “ccpa” the california privacy act 

table of contents 

“cpra” the colorado privacy act “cpa” the virginia consumer data protection act “vcdpa” and the brazilian general data protection law “lgpd” were also recently enacted and became effective in 2020 and these laws create new data privacy rights for individuals complying with the gdpr the ccpa the cpra the cpa the vcdpa the lgpd and similar emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices noncompliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties legal proceedings by governmental entities or others and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to retain and attract customers any of the risks described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

regulation of the vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of laws regulations and ordinances these include without limitation land use ordinances business and occupational licensure requirements and procedures vehicle titling sales and registration rules and procedures and laws and regulations relating to the environment antimoney laundering anticorruption exporting and reporting and notification requirements to agencies and law enforcement relating to vehicle transfers many of these laws and regulations are frequently complex and subject to interpretation and failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations may result in impairment or suspension of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we may be subject to similar types of regulations by governmental agencies in new markets in addition new legal or regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of vehicle buyers may decrease demand for our vehicles and may adversely impact our ability to conduct business 

changes in laws or the interpretation of laws including foreign laws and regulations affecting the import and export of vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base as a result our foreign buyers may be subject to a variety of foreign laws and regulations including the imposition of import duties by foreign countries changes in laws regulations and treaties that restrict or impede or negatively affect the economics surrounding the importation of vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base in addition we and our vehicle buyers must work with foreign customs agencies and other nonus governmental officials who are responsible for the interpretation application and enforcement of these laws regulations and treaties any inability to obtain requisite approvals or agreements from such authorities could adversely impact the ability of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries in addition any disputes or disagreements with foreign agencies or officials over import duties tariffs or similar matters including disagreements over the value assigned to imported vehicles could adversely affect our costs and the ability and costs of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad changes in the interpretation application and enforcement of laws regulations or treaties any failure to comply with nonus laws or regulatory interpretations or any legal or regulatory interpretations or governmental actions that significantly increase our costs or the costs of our buyers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services and our ability to compete in nonus markets 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

our operations are subject to international federal provincial state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities requiring us to actively monitor and manage potential environmental impacts in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations in addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions we also take such appropriate actions as may be necessary to avoid liability for activities of prior owners and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks there can be no assurances however that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities we have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over 

table of contents 

time there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us in addition to acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions we have also obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

changes in federal state and local or foreign tax laws changing interpretations of existing tax laws or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state provincial and local levels in the us the uk and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate including income taxes sales taxes valueadded “vat” taxes and similar taxes and assessments the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe our tax positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service “irs” in the united states hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom state tax authorities in the states in which we operate and other similar tax authorities in international jurisdictions we have been subject to audits and challenges from applicable federal state or foreign tax authorities in the past and may be subject to similar audits and challenges in the future while we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes interest and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities 

new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

for example on august 16 2022 the us government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 which includes changes to the us corporate income tax system including a 15 minimum tax based on “adjusted financial statement income” for certain large corporations which will not be effective until fiscal year 2024 and a 1 excise tax on share repurchases after december 31 2022 we are currently assessing the potential impact of these legislative changes 

risks related to our intellectual property and technology 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial position 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer 

table of contents 

functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we continue to design and develop this system 

we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system to address our international expansion needs the ongoing design development and implementation of our enterprise operating systems carries certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the transition to our internally developed proprietary system will continue to require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance that the volume of business will increase we began using our internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 

we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due among other things to slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

disruptions to our information technology systems including failure to prevent outages maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems and other confidential information could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

information availability and security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of in addition to other factors the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees in addition human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to information technology system disruptions andor cyberattacks including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system phishing attacks ransomware attacks or other information technology data security incidents 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control

information technology system disruptions cyberattacks ransomware attacks or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation operating results or financial condition by among other things making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time damaging our reputation with buyers sellers and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including account data information or resulting in governmental investigations litigation liability fines or penalties against us if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of these cyber risks our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation 

we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions these attempts have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business for example in april 2015 we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to data provided to us by our members that is considered to be personal information in certain jurisdictions we immediately investigated including the engagement of an external expert security firm and made the required notifications to members whose information may have been accessed and to regulatory agencies 

we are regularly evaluating and implementing new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyberattacks and system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes we have further enhanced our security protocols based on the investigation we conducted in response to the security incident nevertheless we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address prior data security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future data security incidents or system failures will be successful the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyberattacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future if our systems are compromised again in the future become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired in the event of a ransomware attack we could suffer significant financial and reputational harm regardless of whether we choose to pay the ransom amount in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

• enhance our existing services 

• develop access acquire and license new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers and 

• respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a costeffective and timely basis 

developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

• fluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles 

• fluctuations in commodity prices particularly the per ton price of crushed car bodies 

• the impact of foreign exchange gain and loss as a result of international operations

• monetary policy and potential inflation impacts including any adverse effects of inflation on our cash reserves and 

• political issues

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to our different lines of insurance coverage including without limitation medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate more than 11 of our issued and outstanding common stock as of july 31 2022 if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or iv any action or proceeding asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the court of chancery of the state of delaware 

this provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended for which the us federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction or the securities act of 1933 as amended 

table of contents 

any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning or continuing to hold or own any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions although we believe this exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies the exclusive forum provision may i increase the costs for a stockholder andor ii limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors officers other employees stockholders or others which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provision further in the event a court finds the exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our results of operations 

general risk factors 

cash investments are subject to risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these investmentrelated risk items may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices fluctuations in used car prices and vehiclerelated technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates whether due to among other things a reduction in miles driven per car vehiclerelated technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and to the extent widely adopted the advent of autonomous vehicles could have a material impact on revenue growth similarly a reduction in total loss frequency rates due to among other things sharp increases in used car prices that make it less economical for insurance company sellers to declare a vehicle involved in an accident a total loss could also have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts which we refer to as pip the cost of transporting the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in transportation rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position

overview 

we are a leading global provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states “us” canada the united kingdom “uk” brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates “uae” oman bahrain and spain 

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us with respect to our environmental stewardship we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global reuse and recycling of vehicles parts and raw materials we are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers each vehicle that enters our business operations already exists with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacture have already occurred however upon our receipt of an existing vehicle we help decrease its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing for example many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to driveable condition reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing and finally some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping reducing the need for further new resource extraction in each of these cases our business reduces the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry 

beyond our environmental stewardship we also support the world’s communities in two important ways first we believe that we contribute to economic development and wellbeing by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world for example many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education health care and wellbeing more generally secondly because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve for example we mobilized our people entered into emergency leases and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve store and remarket tens of thousands of flooddamaged vehicles in the new york metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane ida in the fall of 2021 

table of contents 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers vehicle rental companies and individuals we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland finland the uae oman and bahrain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction such as delivery and storage in the uk germany and spain we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own we have certain contracts with insurance companies primarily in the uk in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by several factors including total loss frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price as a significant amount of our service revenue is associated in some manner with the ultimate selling price of the vehicle vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by i market demand for rebuildable driveable vehicles ii used car pricing which we also believe has an impact on total loss frequency iii end market demand for recycled and refurbished parts as reflected in demand from dismantlers iv the mix of cars sold v changes in the us dollar exchange rate to foreign currencies which we believe has an impact on auction participation by international buyers and vi changes in commodity prices particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies as we believe this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling we cannot specifically quantify the financial impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles our service revenues or financial results total loss frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repair costs used car values and auction returns over the past 30 years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in total loss frequency this increase in total loss frequency may have been driven by changes in used car values and repair costs over the same longterm horizon which we believe are generally trending upward recently we have noted fluctuations in total loss frequency nonetheless we believe the longterm trend of increases in total loss frequency will continue in the near term changes in used car prices and repair cost may tend to reduce total loss frequency and thereby affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road the average age of cars on the road has continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 122 years in 2022 repair costs are generally based on damage severity vehicle complexity repair parts availability repair parts costs labor costs and repair shop lead times the factors that can influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements with precision 

beginning in march 2020 our business and operations began to experience the impact of the worldwide covid19 pandemic in materially all of our jurisdictions we have been deemed by local authorities an essential business because our operations ensure the removal of vehicles from repair shops impound yards and streets and highways enabling the critical function of road infrastructure as a result we have continued to operate our facilities as well as our onlineonly auctions while following appropriate health and safety protocols to ensure safe working conditions for our employees as well as for our sellers buyers and other business partners with whom we come in contact 

table of contents 

from a financial perspective our operating results were adversely affected by lower processed vehicle volume but these adverse effects were more than offset by corresponding increases in vehicle average sales prices although we initially saw substantial declines in vehicle assignments following the onset of the covid19 pandemic which we attribute principally to reduced accident volume as miles driven dramatically declined in response to shelterinplace orders across the globe we have generally seen vehicle assignment volumes steadily recovering however additional subsequent shelterinplace orders have occasionally stalled or regressed the assignment volume commensurate with the severity and duration of such orders we cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop whether and to what extent new shelterinplace orders will be issued or to what extent the pandemic may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our markets including for example the risk of longterm reductions in miles driven 

although we have been deemed an “essential business” in the jurisdictions in which we operate and have largely been able to continue our yard operations we have been required to make adjustments in our business processes that may reduce efficiency or increase operating expenses particularly if the pandemic continues over a long period of time we adjusted but did not make material modifications to our operating expenses to be able to continue providing employment for our employees service to our sellers and process incoming vehicles for sale in future quarters the pandemic may have an adverse effect on our future revenues with the magnitude and timing of these effects dependent upon the extent and duration of suspended economic activity across our markets we believe that the longerterm impact on our business will depend on potential adverse operational impacts from outbreaks of covid19 at any of our locations additional outbreaks of covid19 in one or more of our geographic markets a reduction in miles driven due to one or more factors relating to the covid19 pandemic the relationship of supply and demand for newly manufactured vehicles on the one hand and used and salvage vehicles on the other hand due to reduced manufacturing capacity and broader supply chain disruptions during the covid19 pandemic and the effects of these supply and demand relationships on the average sale prices obtained at auction for the vehicles assigned to us for remarketing further government actions in response to covid19 outbreaks that restrict business activity or travel disruptions of governmental administrative operations due to covid19 outbreaks that adversely impact our core business activities such as vehicle title processing and deteriorating economic conditions generally and the potential availability among other things of vaccines or treatments none of which we can predict for a further discussion of risks to our business and operating results arising from the pandemic please see the section of this annual report on form 10k captioned “risk factors” 

operating costs and expenses yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent vehicle transportation insurance property related taxes fuel equipment maintenance and repair marketing costs directly related to the auction process and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel professional services marketing expenses and system maintenance and enhancements 

other expense income other expense income consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 9 — longterm debt foreign exchange rate gains and losses gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates 

liquidity and cash flows our primary source of working capital is cash operating results and debt financing the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and revolving loan facility the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v total loss frequency vi volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix xi contract mix to the extent applicable xii our capital expenditures and xiii other macroeconomic factors such as covid19 these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital and liquidity are the sale of assets or the issuance of shares through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital and liquidity is the issuance of additional debt or equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future or on commercially acceptable terms

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in the us canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain with the intention of providing global coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following tables set forth operational facilities that we have opened and are now operational from august 1 2019 through july 31 2022

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 excluding additional funds available to us through our revolving loan facility 



cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and working capital increased 3360 million and 4800 million at july 31 2022 respectively as compared to july 31 2021 cash cash equivalents and restricted cash increased primarily due to cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by capital expenditures the retirement of 100 of the senior notes under the note purchase agreement working capital increased primarily from cash generated from operations and timing of cash receipts and payments partially offset by capital expenditures and certain income tax benefits related to stock option exercises cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits certificates of deposit us treasury bills and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of service fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales we expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business in addition to our stock repurchase program we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash balances and our cash flows from operations these alternative potential uses include additional stock repurchases the payment of dividends and acquisitions for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 9 — longterm debt and note 12 — stockholders’ equity and under the subheadings “ credit agreement ” and “ note purchase agreement ” below 

our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the 

table of contents 

winter months most of our facilities process 5 to 20 more vehicles than at other times of the year severe weather events including but not limited to tornadoes floods hurricanes and hailstorms can also impact our volumes these increased volumes require the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements the foreseeable future we expect to acquire or develop additional locations and expand some of our current facilities in the foreseeable future we may be required to raise additional cash through drawdowns on our revolving loan facility or issuance of additional equity to fund this expansion although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business 

as of july 31 2022 967 million of the 14 billion of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us the repatriation of these funds could still be subject to the foreign withholding tax following the us tax reform however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not require repatriation to fund our us operations 

net cash provided by operating activities increased for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to improved cash operating results primarily from an increase in service and vehicle sales revenues partially offset by an increase in yard operations and general and administrative expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in funds received in accounts receivable of 298 million and a increase in cash generated from the sale of inventory of 138 million partially offset by net income taxes receivable of 366 million primarily related to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and an investment in solar investment tax credit and decreases in funds used to pay accounts payable of 83 million 

net cash used in investing activities decreased for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due primarily to decreases in capital expenditures net against an increase in acquisitions and proceeds from the sale of assets our capital expenditures are primarily related to acquiring land opening and improving facilities capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements acquiring yard equipment and lease buyouts of certain facilities we continue to develop expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations as of july 31 2022 we have no material noncancelable commitments for future capital expenditures capitalized software development costs were 120 million 136 million and 132 million for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies 

net cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due primarily to lower payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings as discussed in further detail under the subheading “stock repurchases” and the notes to consolidated financial statements note 12 — stockholders’ equity and the retirement of 100 of the senior notes under the note purchase agreement as discussed in note 9 — longterm debt  partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we consider the following policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for additional information see note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item i “financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process service revenue and vehicle sales revenue are recognized at the date the vehicles are sold at auction excluding annual registration fees costs to prepare the vehicles for auction including inbound transportation costs and titling fees are deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition at auction 

our disaggregation between service revenues and vehicle sales at the segment level reflects how the nature timing amount and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are impacted by economic factors we report sales taxes on relevant transactions on a net basis in our consolidated results of operations and therefore do not include sales taxes in revenues or costs 

service revenues 

our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services within this revenue category our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these services are not distinct within the context of the contract accordingly revenue for these services is recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied at the completion of the auction process we do not take ownership of these consigned vehicles which are stored at our facilities located throughout the us and at its international locations these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged 

we have a separate performance obligation related to providing access to our online auction platform we charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our online auctions and access our bidding platform this fee is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement generally one year as each day of access to the online auction platform represents the best depiction of the transfer of the service 

table of contents 

no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return or warranty although we provide for expected credit losses in the case of nonperformance by our buyers or sellers 



vehicle sales 

certain vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf we have a single performance obligation related to the sale of these vehicles which is the completion of the online auction process vehicle sales revenue is recognized on the auction date as we act as a principal in vehicle sales transactions the gross sales price at auction is recorded as revenue 

contract assets 

we capitalize certain contract assets related to obtaining a contract where the amortization period for the related asset is greater than one year these assets are amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship contract assets are classified as current or longterm other assets based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the related revenues and are amortized as an offset to the associated revenues on a straightline basis we assess these costs for impairment at least quarterly and as “triggering” events occur that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the contract asset costs where the amortization period for the related asset is one year or less are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

uncertain tax positions 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities in the ordinary course of global business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain in addition our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic political and other conditions such as new covid19 variants 

our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions in addition a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws and significant judgment is necessary to i determine whether based on the technical merits a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and ii measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition development in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given 

table of contents 

that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits us treasury bills and money market funds as of july 31 2022 as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2022 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2022 a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement were zero as of july 31 2022 the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement bears interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the federal funds rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum to the greatest of a the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050 or b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by bank of america as its “prime rate” and ii sofr for a onemonth interest period for such date plus 10 plus an applicable margin ranging from 000 to 075 based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b the sofr plus an applicable margin ranging from 100 to 175 depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable arrears at the end of each calendar quarter for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of sofr loans if interest rates were to increase by 10 it would not materially affect our operating results 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 120 million for fiscal 2022 

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2022 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of 1694 million this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states “us” canada the united kingdom “uk” brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates “uae” oman bahrain and spain 

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us with respect to our environmental stewardship we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global reuse and recycling of vehicles parts and raw materials we are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers each vehicle that enters our business operations already exists with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacture have already occurred however upon our receipt of an existing vehicle we help decrease its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing for example many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to driveable condition reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing and finally some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material 

inputs through scrapping reducing the need for further new resource extraction in each of these cases our business reduces the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry 

beyond our environmental stewardship we also support the world’s communities in two important ways first we believe that we contribute to economic development and wellbeing by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world for example many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education health care and wellbeing more generally secondly because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve for example we mobilized our people entered into emergency leases and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve store and remarket tens of thousands of flooddamaged vehicles in the houston texas metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane harvey in the summer of 2017 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers vehicle rental companies and individuals we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland finland the uae oman and bahrain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction such as delivery and storage in the uk germany and spain we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured 

through our vb3 auction platform our sales process is open to registered buyers whom we refer to as “members” anywhere in the world with access to the internet this technology and model employ a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows members to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility or over the internet during the preview period to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb3 system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb3’s bid4u feature incrementally bids on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe our virtual auction platform increases the pool of available buyers for each sale which brings added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improves the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements which would be associated with holding live auctions 

for fiscal 2021 sales of us vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 641 of total vehicles sold of which 297 of vehicles were sold to out of state members within the us and 344 were sold to international members based on the ip address utilized during the auction process 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

• providing coverage that facilitates seller access to buyers around the world reducing towing and thirdparty storage expenses offering a local presence for vehicle inspection stations and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by specially trained teams 

• providing a comprehensive range of services that includes merchandising efficient title processing timely pickup and delivery of vehicles and internet sales 

• establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions 

• increasing the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and convenience of internet bidding 

• applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through internet bidding webbased order processing salvage value quotes electronic communication with members and sellers and vehicle imaging and 

• providing a venue for insurance customers through our virtual insured exchange “vix” product to contingently sell a vehicle through our auction process to assess true market value equipping our insurance customers with market data in its negotiations with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles 

historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in the amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both members and sellers and v growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal 2021 our revenues were 27 billion and our operating income was 11 billion 

in fiscal 2019 we opened one new operational facility in brazil seven new operational facilities in germany eleven new operational facilities in the us and acquired an operational facility in greenville kentucky 

in fiscal 2020 we opened two new operational facilities in germany one new operational facility in brazil and three new operational facilities in the us 

in fiscal 2021 we opened one new operational facility in germany one new operational facility in spain ten new operational facilities in the us and acquired an operational facility in des moines iowa 

our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own we have certain contracts with insurance companies primarily in the uk in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent vehicle transportation insurance property related taxes fuel equipment maintenance and repair marketing costs directly related to the auction process and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel professional services marketing expenses and system maintenance and enhancements 

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price occasionally companies in our industry purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based on the vehicles’ estimated preaccident value “pav” and the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and released to the buyer while companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction or a hybrid internet and physical auction we sell virtually all our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers vehicle rental companies and individuals our primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

the primary buyers of vehicles at our auctions are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers based on volume of vehicles purchased either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

most of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident or to a lesser extent a natural disaster typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its pav the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the pav less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer and navigation systems advanced cameras including backup camera systems collision warning systems dynamic cruise control lane departure warning systems automatic braking and blind spot detection systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

• the anticipated percentage return on salvage ie gross salvage proceeds minus vehicle handling and selling expenses divided by the pav 

• the services provided by the company and the degree to which such services reduce their administrative costs and expenses 

• the price the company charges for its services 

• geographic coverage 

• the ability to respond to natural disasters 

• the ability to provide analytical data to the seller and 

• in the uk in certain situations the actual amount paid for the vehicle 

in the uk some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles under these circumstances insurance companies will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order or the assignment we arrange for the transportation of a vehicle to our nearest facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations although we may offer transportation services to obtain the vehicle at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold at auction on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member typically seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller 

operating and growth strategy 

our growth strategy is to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets including foreign markets ii pursuing global national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

sales 

we process vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle sellers no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2021 2020 or 2019 and our business does not depend on any particular customer to remain profitable we obtained 77 81 and 80 of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively from insurance company sellers 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle sellers the agreements are customized to each vehicle seller’s needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle seller in a designated geographic area 

we market our services to vehicle sellers through an inhouse sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques including personal sales calls internet search engines employee referrals tow shop referrals and participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions targeted mailing of our sales literature and telemarketing we market our services to franchise and independent dealerships as well as the general public we may when appropriate provide vehicle sellers with detailed analysis of the net return on vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses 

during our last three fiscal years most of our revenue was generated within the us and a majority of our longlived assets are located within the us please see note 13 — segments and other geographic reporting in our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the geographic location of our sales and our longlived assets 

members 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered members “buyers” in the vehicle dismantling and recycling rebuilding used vehicle dealer and export industries as well as members that are a part of the general public where applicable we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing members with a variety of programs and services to become a registered member a person or business must complete a basic application either online or through our mobile application before any member may purchase a vehicle they must provide copies of current government issued photo identification additionally business members must provide current business information including copies of licenses which may include vehicle dismantler dealer resale repair or export licenses and as needed completed sales tax exemption certificates registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements we may sell to the general public either directly or members may purchase a vehicle offered at copart through a registered broker who meets local licensing and permitting requirements strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that will not result in a completed sale we market to members online and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing direct mail inlocation marketing search engines social media radio television trade publications and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles against these other vehicle remarketers we face competition for longterm contractual commitments and various supply agreements with sellers in addition to competition for the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in the us include insurance auto auctions inc “iaa” kar auction services inc “kar” including its subsidiary adesa inc manheim inc and acv auctions inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation “lkq” lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in our international markets our principal competitors are vehicle auction and sales companies vehicle dismantlers and privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary yard management information system consists of a series of ibm as400 mainframe computer systems and other servers which run our proprietary software developed to process salvage sales vehicles throughout the auction process this system is integrated with the internet to enable buyers to view salvage vehicles and bid on them it can also be integrated with the seller’s system and enables the sellers to monitor their vehicles and analyze the progression of vehicles through the auction process our auctionstyle service product vb3 is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required 

we have invested in production data centers that are designed to continuously operate to support the business even in the event of an emergency the data centers’ electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored the data centers are located in areas generally considered to be free of frequent weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes we operate fully redundant infrastructure to ensure ongoing operations even in the event of physical damage to one of our data centers 

we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system to enable us to address our international expansion needs this proprietary system is designed to provide multilanguage and multicurrency capabilities we began using our internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 we intend to continue development of this system and implement it in certain additional locations in the future

our executive compensation structure aligns incentives with our strategic growth objectives including longterm share price appreciation in that regard our executive compensation programs place greater weighting on equity compensation than other forms of compensation offered to all employees for more details regarding our executive compensation refer to information incorporated by reference from the information set forth under the captions “executive compensation” and “compensation discussion and analysis” in our 2021 proxy statement 

we value the health and wellbeing of our employees and provide generous benefit options to best suit our employees and their families within our us segment we pay a significant portion of the benefit premiums related to our health benefits in many cases employees are offered certain benefits at no charge to them or their families 

our us benefit platform is built from a whole person model meaning we offer options that assist in keeping the whole person healthy employees and their families can select from a wide range of benefits from traditional health and dental insurance to financial wellness and estate planning we have designed our plans around the following four pillars health financial security life and education

within our international segment we also offer a variety of benefit plans similar to the us segment albeit adjusted to reflect local market conditions 

in fiscal 2021 our ongoing focus on workplace safety and regulatory compliance has enabled us to maintain business continuity while promoting a safe work environment during the covid19 pandemic specifically we introduced workfromhome arrangements for a substantial portion of our workforce and social distancing for those that have returned to the office in accordance with local health authority guidelines 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to international federal provincial state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities requiring us to actively monitor and manage potential environmental impacts in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations in addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions we also take such appropriate actions as may be necessary to avoid liability for activities of prior owners and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks there can be no assurances however that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities we have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us in addition to acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions we have also obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various international federal provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations that may impact our capital expenditures earnings and competitive position the acquisition and sale of vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and foreign motor vehicle departments and the steps required to process vehicle titles is a significant cost of our business at the same time our knowhow in the area of title processing is a competitive advantage in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities which generally make it more challenging and expensive to identify acquire and develop new facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by international federal provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in 2008 we obtained a patent issued by the united states patent and trademark office that covers certain aspects of our virtual bidding auction platform generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with certain of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents severe weather events including but not limited to tornadoes floods hurricanes and hailstorms can also impact our volumes 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

risks related to our business and industry 

the worldwide covid19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on our nearterm revenues principally as a result of lower auction inventories the geographic extent length and economic impact of the pandemic is unknown but it has the potential to adversely affect our business and operating results 

after the initial onset of the covid19 pandemic in march 2020 we saw substantial declines in vehicle assignments which we attribute principally to reduced accident volume as miles driven dramatically declined in response to shelterinplace orders across the globe we cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop whether and to what extent new shelterinplace orders will be issued or to what extent the pandemic may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our markets including for example the risk of longterm reductions in miles driven 

although we have been deemed an “essential business” in the jurisdictions in which we operate and have largely been able to continue our yard operations we have been required to make adjustments in our business processes that may reduce efficiency or increase operating expenses particularly if the pandemic continues over a long period of time certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate such as the uk have had more restrictive governmental actions than others and subsequent shelterinplace orders have occasionally stalled or regressed our assignment volumes commensurate with the severity and 

duration of such orders to date we have not made modifications that materially affect our operating expenses and while we regularly monitor them we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed to align revenues and operating expenses when necessary which could result in a drop in our stock price as a result of our operating or net income for one or more fiscal periods being less than market expectations additional nonexclusive examples of pandemicrelated factors that could adversely affect our future business or operating results include the potential adverse operational impacts from outbreaks of covid19 at any of our locations additional outbreaks of covid19 in one or more of our geographic markets a reduction in miles driven due to one or more factors relating to the covid19 pandemic the relationship of supply and demand for newly manufactured vehicles on the one hand and used and salvage vehicles on the other hand due to reduced manufacturing capacity and broader supply chain disruptions during the covid19 pandemic and the effects of these supply and demand relationships on the average sale prices obtained at auction for the vehicles assigned to us for remarketing further government actions in response to covid19 outbreaks that restrict business activity or travel disruptions of governmental administrative operations due to covid19 outbreaks that adversely impact our core business activities such as vehicle title processing and deteriorating economic conditions generally 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

although no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2021 2020 or 2019 a limited number of vehicle sellers historically have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected revenues in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside the us including expansions in europe brazil and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired or operational capabilities established outside the us could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside the us in fiscal 2003 with an acquisition in canada subsequently in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we made significant acquisitions in the uk followed by acquisitions in the uae brazil germany and spain in fiscal 2013 expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015 expansion into the republic of ireland and india in fiscal 2016 and an acquisition in finland in fiscal 2018 in addition we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside of the us acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside of the us pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards and operations acquiring buyers and sellers and implementing shared services capabilities in international markets among other things we plan to ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally for example although we continue to operate a technology and operations center in india for administrative support we decided to suspend our salvage operations in india in fiscal 2018 until the indian market develops in a manner better suited to our business model which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results moreover success in opening and operating facilities in new markets can be dependent upon establishing new relationships with buyers and sellers and our failure to establish those relationships could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

• the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices 

• the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations 

• the need to localize our product offerings particularly the need to implement our online auction platform in foreign countries 

• the need to comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations 

• tariffs trade barriers trade disputes and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets 

• exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and revenue growth rates 

• adapting to different business cultures languages and market structures particularly where we seek to implement our auction model in markets where insurers have historically not played a substantial role in the disposition of salvage vehicles 

• repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates 

• military actions 

• public health issues including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic 

• environmental issues 

• natural and manmade disasters and 

• political issues 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet and other points of access while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in the us canada and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

we implemented our online system across all of our us canada and uk salvage yards between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in those markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in the us canada and the uk however we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to maintain sufficient capacity to accept additional vehicles at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita sandy and harvey had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2019 we opened one new operational facility in brazil seven new operational facilities in germany eleven new operational facilities in the us and acquired an operational facility in greenville kentucky in fiscal 2020 we opened two new operational facilities in germany one new operational facility in brazil and three new operational facilities in the us in fiscal 2021 we opened one new operational facility in germany one new operational facility in spain ten new operational facilities in the us and acquired an operational facility in des moines iowa acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

• continue to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms 

• expand existing facilities in nogrowth regulatory environments 

• obtain or retain buyers sellers and sales volumes in new markets or facilities 

• increase revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities 

• maintain the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions 

• create new vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and profitability requirements or 

• obtain necessary regulatory approvals under applicable antitrust and competition laws 

in addition certain of the acquisition agreements under which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a 

result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

• hire train and manage additional qualified personnel 

• establish new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle sellers 

• identify and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms 

• secure adequate capital 

• identify productive uses for available capital reserves and 

• maintain the supply of vehicles from vehicle sellers 

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely primarily upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure accidents and related injury claims availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have initiated and intend to continue to initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and copart lounge programs through which registered members can open copart storefronts in foreign markets with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public will involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived these programs could also create additional risks including heightened regulation and litigation risk related to vehicle sales to the general public and heightened branding reputational and intellectual property risk associated with allowing copart registered members to establish copartbranded storefronts in foreign jurisdictions 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle supply only a portion of which are referred to as inventory which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our salvage vehicle supply will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather 

conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form 10k in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2006 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2018 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricanes katrina rita sandy and harvey weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory and included premiums for subhaulers payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer and jeffrey liaw our president or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

the vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage and other vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we do currently or will have in the future due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk and other foreign markets the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

risks related to regulatory compliance and legal matters 

our business activities and public policy interests expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

our business activities facilities expansions and civic and public policy interests may be unpopular in certain communities exposing us to reputational and political risk for example public opposition in some communities to different aspects of our business operations has impacted our ability to obtain required business use permits additionally our interests in legislative and regulatory processes at different levels of government in the geographies in which we operate have been opposed by competitors and other interest groups although we believe we generally enjoy positive community relationships and political 

support in our range of operations shifting public opinion sentiments and sociopolitical dynamics could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our operations and acquisitions in the us and certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in some cases the enforcement practices of governmental regulators in certain foreign areas and the procedural and substantive rights and remedies available to us may vary significantly from those in the united states which could have an adverse effect on our business 

although we face risks associated with international expansion in each of the nonus markets where we operate our current focus on the german market heightens the risks we face relating to our expansion plans in germany 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not previously been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” uk bribery act brazil clean companies act india’s prevention of corruption act 1988 or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

on january 29 2020 the european parliament approved the uk’s withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk officially left the european union on january 31 2020 although we have not experienced any material disruptions in our business as a result of brexit to date the ultimate effects of brexit on us are still difficult to predict and adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the competition and markets authority “uk regulator” if an inquiry is made by the uk regulator we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulator will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the uk regulator determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulator the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the us market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in the us 

some of our target markets outside the us operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in the us for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased and then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in the us in which we generally act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in the us canada and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets including germany insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of vehicles as we expand into markets outside the us canada and the uk including germany in particular we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions 

of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

acquisitions typically will increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions to date most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and other obligations regarding privacy and data protection 

we are subject to federal state and international laws directives and regulations relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personal data these laws directives and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in the european union on may 25 2018 applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the european union and may also apply to related products and services that we offer to european union users similarly the california consumer privacy act or ab375 “ccpa” and the brazilian general data protection law “lgpd” were also recently enacted and became effective in 2020 and these laws create new data privacy rights for individuals complying with the gdpr the ccpa the lgpd and similar emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices noncompliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties legal proceedings by governmental entities or others and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to retain and attract customers any of the risks described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

regulation of the vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of laws regulations and ordinances these include without limitation land use ordinances business and occupational licensure requirements and procedures vehicle titling sales and registration rules and procedures and laws and regulations relating to the environment antimoney laundering anticorruption exporting and reporting and notification requirements to agencies and law enforcement relating to vehicle transfers many of these laws and regulations are frequently complex and subject to interpretation and failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations may result in impairment or suspension of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we may be subject to similar types of regulations by governmental agencies in new markets in addition new legal or regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of vehicle buyers may decrease demand for our vehicles and may adversely impact our ability to conduct business 

changes in laws or the interpretation of laws including foreign laws and regulations affecting the import and export of vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base as a result our foreign buyers may be subject to a variety of foreign laws and regulations including the imposition of import duties by foreign countries changes in laws regulations and treaties that restrict or impede or negatively affect the economics surrounding the importation of vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base in addition we and our vehicle buyers must work with foreign customs agencies and other nonus governmental officials who are responsible for the interpretation application and enforcement of these laws regulations and treaties any inability to obtain requisite approvals or agreements from such authorities could adversely impact the ability of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries in addition any disputes or disagreements with foreign agencies or officials over import duties tariffs or similar matters including disagreements over the value assigned to imported vehicles could adversely affect our costs and the ability and costs of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that 

placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad changes in the interpretation application and enforcement of laws regulations or treaties any failure to comply with nonus laws or regulatory interpretations or any legal or regulatory interpretations or governmental actions that significantly increase our costs or the costs of our buyers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services and our ability to compete in nonus markets 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

our operations are subject to international federal provincial state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities requiring us to actively monitor and manage potential environmental impacts in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations in addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions we also take such appropriate actions as may be necessary to avoid liability for activities of prior owners and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks there can be no assurances however that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities we have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us in addition to acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions we have also obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

changes in federal state and local or foreign tax laws changing interpretations of existing tax laws or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state provincial and local levels in the us the uk and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate including income taxes sales taxes valueadded “vat” taxes and similar taxes and assessments the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe our tax positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service or irs in the united states hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom state tax authorities in the states in which we operate and other similar tax authorities in international jurisdictions we have been subject to audits and challenges from applicable federal state or foreign tax authorities in the past and may be subject to similar audits and challenges in the future while we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes interest and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities 

new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” or “tax act” was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act significantly revamped us taxation of corporations including a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 a repeal of the exceptions to the 10 million deduction limitation for performancebased compensation to covered employees and a new tax regime for foreign earnings any subsequent repeal of the tax act could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of the provisions of the tax act are highly complex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the irs or others some of the provisions of the tax act may be changed by a future congress or challenged by the world 

trade organization “wto” although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance or actions by a future congress or wto they could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

risks related to our intellectual property and technology 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial position 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we continue to design and develop this system 

we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system to address our international expansion needs the ongoing design development and implementation of our enterprise operating systems carries certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the transition to our internally developed proprietary system will continue to require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance that the volume of business will increase we began using our internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 

we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely 

basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due among other things to slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

decreased utility of internally developed capitalized software could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout as of july 31 2021 the net amount of capitalized software development costs shown on our consolidated balance sheet is 228 million if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs could be expensed in part or in full 

disruptions to our information technology systems including failure to prevent outages maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems and other confidential information could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

information availability and security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of in addition to other factors the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees in addition human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to information technology system disruptions andor cyberattacks including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system phishing attacks ransomware attacks or other information technology data security incidents 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control 

information technology system disruptions cyberattacks ransomware attacks or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation operating results or financial condition by among other things making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time damaging our reputation with buyers sellers and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including account data information or resulting in governmental investigations litigation liability fines or penalties against us if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of these cyber risks our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation 

we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions these attempts have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business for example in april 2015 we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to data provided to us by our members that is considered to be personal information in certain jurisdictions we immediately investigated including the engagement of an external expert security firm and made the required notifications to members whose information may have been accessed and to regulatory agencies 

we are regularly evaluating and implementing new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyberattacks and system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes we have further enhanced our security protocols based on 

the investigation we conducted in response to the security incident nevertheless we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address prior data security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future data security incidents or system failures will be successful the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyberattacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future if our systems are compromised again in the future become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired in the event of a ransomware attack we could suffer significant financial and reputational harm regardless of whether we choose to pay the ransom amount in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

• enhance our existing services 

• develop access acquire and license new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers and 

• respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a costeffective and timely basis 

developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

• fluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles 

• fluctuations in commodity prices particularly the per ton price of crushed car bodies 

• the impact of foreign exchange gain and loss as a result of international operations 

• the impact of potential negative interest rates on our cash reserves 

• our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations in international markets and any additional markets we may enter 

• forthcoming cessation of the libor interest rate standard 

• the availability of salvage vehicles or other vehicles we sell including the supply of used and salvage vehicles in relation to the supply of new vehicle alternatives 

• variations in vehicle accident rates 

• supply chain disruptions 

• member participation in the internet bidding process 

• delays or changes in state title processing 

• changes in international state or federal laws regulations or treaties affecting the vehicles we sell 

• changes in the application interpretation and enforcement of existing laws regulations or treaties 

• trade disputes and other political diplomatic legal or regulatory developments 

• inconsistent application or enforcement of laws or regulations by regulators governmental or quasigovernmental entities or law enforcement or quasilaw enforcement agencies as compared to our competitors 

• changes in laws affecting who may purchase the vehicles we sell 

• the timing and size of our new facility openings 

• the announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors 

• the severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure 

• the availability and cost of general business insurance 

• labor costs and collective bargaining 

• changes in the current levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles 

• the introduction of a similar internet product by a competitor 

• the ability to obtain or maintain necessary permits to operate 

• goodwill impairment 

• military actions 

• bank failures 

• natural and manmade disasters 

• public health issues including covid19 and other pandemics 

• monetary policy and potential inflation impacts including any adverse effects of inflation on our cash reserves and 

• political issues 

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to our different lines of insurance coverage including without limitation medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate more than 11 of our issued and outstanding common stock as of july 31 2021 if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders iii any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or iv any action or proceeding asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the court of chancery of the state of delaware

general risk factors 

cash investments are subject to risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these investmentrelated risk items may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices declines in used car prices and vehiclerelated technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates whether due to among other things a reduction in miles driven per car vehiclerelated technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and to the extent widely adopted the advent of autonomous vehicles could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts which we refer to as pip the cost of transporting the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in transportation rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will not exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

on january 29 2020 the european parliament approved the uk’s withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk officially left the european union on january 31 2020 although we have not experienced any material disruptions in our business as a result of brexit to date the ultimate effects of brexit on us are still difficult to predict and adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states “us” canada the united kingdom “uk” brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates “uae” oman bahrain and spain 

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us with respect to our environmental stewardship we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global reuse and recycling of vehicles parts and raw materials we are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers each vehicle that enters our business operations already exists with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacture have already occurred however upon our receipt of an existing vehicle we help decrease its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing for example many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to driveable condition reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing and finally some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping reducing the need for further new resource extraction in each of these cases our business reduces the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry 

beyond our environmental stewardship we also support the world’s communities in two important ways first we believe that we contribute to economic development and wellbeing by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world for example many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education health care and wellbeing more generally secondly because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve for example we mobilized our people entered into emergency leases and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve store and remarket tens of thousands of flooddamaged vehicles in the houston texas metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane harvey in the summer of 2017 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers vehicle rental companies and individuals we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland finland the uae oman and bahrain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction such as delivery and storage in the uk germany and spain we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own we have certain contracts with insurance companies primarily in the uk in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by several factors including total loss frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price as a significant amount of our service revenue is associated in some manner with the ultimate selling price of the vehicle vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by i market demand for rebuildable driveable vehicles ii used car pricing which we also believe has an impact on total loss frequency iii end market demand for recycled and refurbished parts as reflected in demand from dismantlers iv the mix of cars sold v changes in the us dollar exchange rate to foreign currencies which we believe has an impact on auction participation by international buyers and vi changes in commodity prices particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies as we believe this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling we cannot specifically quantify the financial impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles our service revenues or financial results total loss frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repair costs used car values and auction returns over the last several years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in total loss frequency the increase in total loss frequency may have been driven by the change in used car values and repair costs which we believe are generally trending upward changes in used car prices and repair costs may impact total loss frequency and affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road the average age of cars on the road continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 121 years in 2021 repair costs are generally based on damage severity vehicle complexity repair parts availability repair parts costs labor costs and repair shop lead times the factors that can influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in total loss frequency 

beginning in march 2020 our business and operations began to experience the impact of the worldwide covid19 pandemic in materially all of our jurisdictions we have been deemed by local authorities an essential business because our operations ensure the removal of vehicles from repair shops impound yards and streets and highways enabling the critical function of road infrastructure as a result we have continued to operate our facilities as well as our onlineonly auctions while following appropriate health and safety protocols to ensure safe working conditions for our employees as well as for our sellers buyers and other business partners with whom we come in contact 

from a financial perspective our operating results were adversely affected by lower processed vehicle volume but these adverse effects were more than offset by corresponding increases in vehicle average sales prices although we initially saw substantial declines in vehicle assignments following the onset of the covid19 pandemic which we attribute principally to reduced accident volume as miles driven dramatically declined in response to shelterinplace orders across the globe we have generally seen vehicle assignment volumes steadily recovering however additional subsequent shelterinplace orders have occasionally stalled or regressed the assignment volume commensurate with the severity and duration of such orders we cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop whether and to what extent new shelterinplace orders will be issued or to what extent the pandemic may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our markets including for example the risk of longterm reductions in miles driven 

although we have been deemed an “essential business” in the jurisdictions in which we operate and have largely been able to continue our yard operations we have been required to make adjustments in our business processes that may reduce efficiency or increase operating expenses particularly if the pandemic continues over a long period of time we adjusted but did not make material modifications to our operating expenses to be able to continue providing employment for our employees service to our sellers and process incoming vehicles for sale in future quarters the pandemic may have an adverse effect on our future revenues with the magnitude and timing of these effects dependent upon the extent and duration of suspended economic activity across our markets we believe that the longerterm impact on our business will depend on potential adverse operational impacts from outbreaks of covid19 at any of our locations additional outbreaks of covid19 in one or more of our geographic markets a reduction in miles driven due to one or more factors relating to the covid19 pandemic the relationship of supply and demand for newly manufactured vehicles on the one hand and used and salvage vehicles on the other hand due to reduced manufacturing capacity and broader supply chain disruptions during the covid19 pandemic and the effects of these supply and demand relationships on the average sale prices obtained at auction for the vehicles assigned to us for remarketing further government actions in response to covid19 outbreaks that restrict business activity or travel disruptions of governmental administrative operations due to covid19 outbreaks that adversely impact our core business activities such as vehicle title processing and deteriorating economic conditions generally and the potential availability among other things of vaccines or treatments none of which we can predict for a further discussion of risks to our business and operating results arising from the pandemic please see the section of this annual report on form 10k captioned “risk factors” 

operating costs and expenses yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent vehicle transportation insurance property related taxes fuel equipment maintenance and repair marketing costs directly related to the auction process and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel professional services marketing expenses and system maintenance and enhancements 

other expense income other expense income consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt foreign exchange rate gains and losses gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates 

liquidity and cash flows our primary source of working capital is cash operating results and debt financing the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and revolving loan facility the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v total loss frequency vi volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix xi contract mix to the extent applicable xii our capital expenditures and xiii other macroeconomic factors such as covid19 these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital and liquidity are the sale of assets or the issuance of shares through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital and liquidity is the issuance of additional debt or equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future or on commercially acceptable terms 

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in the us canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain with the intention of providing global coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following tables set forth operational facilities that we have opened and are now operational from august 1 2018 through july 31 2021 





the following table sets forth the operational facilities obtained through business acquisitions from august 1 2018 through july 31 2021 



the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets including foreign markets ii pursuing global national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary 

results of operations 

the following table shows certain data from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019

the following table presents a comparison of service revenues for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



service revenues the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2021 of 3447 million or 177 as compared to fiscal 2020 came from i an increase in the us of 3028 million and ii an increase in international of 419 million the growth in the us was driven primarily by an increase in revenue per car partially offset by a decrease in volume the decrease in volume in the us was driven by the covid19 pandemic which reduced accident volume as miles driven declined excluding the beneficial impact of 120 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound and brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates the growth in international of 299 million was driven primarily by increased revenue per car partially offset by decreased volume driven by the covid19 pandemic which reduced accident volume as miles driven decreased 

the following table presents a comparison of vehicle sales for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



vehicle sales the increase in vehicle sales for fiscal 2021 of 1422 million or 550 as compared to fiscal 2020 came from i an increase in the us of 1086 million and ii an increase in international of 336 million the growth in the us was primarily the result of i increased volume and ii higher average auction selling prices which we believe was due to a change in the mix of vehicles sold increased demand and reduced supply excluding a beneficial impact of 102 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound and european union euro to us dollar exchange rates the increase in international of 234 million was primarily the result of higher average auction selling prices partially offset by decreased volume driven by contractual shifts from purchase contracts to fee based service contracts and covid19’s impact on volume which reduced accident volume as miles driven declined 

the following table presents a comparison of yard operations expense for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



yard operations expenses the increase in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2021 of 308 million or 32 as compared to fiscal 2020 resulted from i an increase in the us of 210 million primarily from a 200 million increase in depreciation and an increase in the cost to process each car partially offset by a decline in volume driven by the covid19 pandemic which reduced accident volume as miles driven declined and ii an increase in international of 98 million related primarily from the detrimental impact of 76 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates driven by changes in the british pound brazilian real and european union euro to us dollar exchange rate and an increase in the cost to process each car partially offset by a decrease in volume driven by the covid19 pandemic the increase in yard operations depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from depreciating new and expanded facilities placed into service in the us and international locations 

the following table presents a comparison of cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



cost of vehicle sales  the increase in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2021 of 1208 million or 536 as compared to fiscal 2020 was the result of i an increase in the us of 923 million and ii an increase in international of 286 million the increase in the us was primarily the result of i increased volume and ii higher average purchase prices which we believe was due to a change in the mix of vehicles sold increased demand and reduced supply excluding the detrimental impact of 83 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates driven by changes in the british pound and european euro to us dollar exchange rate the increase in international of 203 million was primarily the result of higher average purchase prices partially offset by decreased volume driven by contractual shifts from purchase contracts to fee based service contracts and covid19’s impact on volume which reduced accident volume as miles driven declined 

the following table presents a comparison of general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 of 150 million or 78 as compared to fiscal 2020 came primarily from i an increase in the us of 178 million partially offset by ii a decrease in international of 28 million excluding depreciation and amortization the decrease in international of 25 million resulted primarily from the detrimental impact of 14 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound brazilian real and european union euro to us dollar exchange rate and lower current period costs including decreased travel costs and the nonrecurrence of certain legal costs incurred in fiscal 2020 excluding depreciation and amortization the increase in the us of 208 million resulted primarily from increases in stock compensation and increased legal costs partially offset by decreased payroll taxes from the exercise of employee stock options and travel costs the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from fully depreciating certain intangible and technology assets in the us and international locations 

the following table summarizes total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 



other expenses the decrease in total other expenses for fiscal 2021 of 07 million or 45 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in currency losses primarily due to the change in the british pound and brazilian real to us dollar exchange rate lower gains on the disposal of certain nonoperating assets in the current year and lower interest income earned in the current year partially offset by higher earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

income taxes our effective income tax rates were 165 and 126 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the current and prior year’s effective tax rate was computed based on the us federal statutory tax rate of 210 the effective tax rate for fiscal year ending july 31 2021 was favorably impacted by 198 million of discrete tax adjustments made in connection with finalizing our fiscal year 2020 tax return the effective tax rate for fiscal year ending july 31 2020 was negatively impacted by 17 million of discrete tax items related to amending previously filed income tax returns the effective tax rates in the current and prior year were also impacted by the recognition of excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options of 298 million and 925 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively

for a discussion of fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 please refer to part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended july 31 2020 filed with the sec on september 28 2020  

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 excluding additional funds available to us through our revolving loan facility 





cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and working capital increased 5705 million and 6739 million at july 31 2021 respectively as compared to july 31 2020 cash cash equivalents and restricted cash increased primarily due to cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by capital expenditures and payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings working capital increased primarily from cash generated from operations and timing of cash receipts and payments partially offset by capital expenditures and certain income tax benefits related to stock option exercises cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits certificates of deposit us treasury bills and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of service fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales we expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business in addition to our stock repurchase program we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash balances and our cash flows from operations these alternative potential uses include additional stock repurchases repayments of longterm debt the payment of dividends and acquisitions for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt and note 11 — stockholders’ equity and under the subheadings “ credit agreement ” and “ note purchase agreement ” below 

our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the winter months most of our facilities process 5 to 20 more vehicles than at other times of the year severe weather events including but not limited to tornadoes floods hurricanes and hailstorms can also impact our volumes these increased volumes require the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

the covid19 pandemic may also impact our liquidity with the magnitude and timing of these effects dependent upon the extent and duration of suspended economic activity across our markets the covid19 pandemic may impact our processed vehicle volume and corresponding vehicle average selling prices 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future we expect to acquire or develop additional locations and expand some of our current facilities in the foreseeable future we may be required to raise additional cash through drawdowns on our revolving loan facility or issuance of additional equity to fund this expansion although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business costs to develop a new yard can range from 30 to 500 million depending on size location and developmental infrastructure requirements 

as of july 31 2021 1595 million of the 10 billion of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us the repatriation of these funds could still be subject to the foreign withholding tax following the us tax reform however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not require repatriation to fund our us operations 

net cash provided by operating activities increased for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to improved cash operating results primarily from an increase in service and vehicle sales revenues partially offset by an increase in yard operations and general and administrative expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a decrease in funds received in accounts receivable of 1435 million and a decrease in cash generated from the sale of inventory of 490 million partially offset by net income taxes receivable of 129 million primarily related to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises decreases in funds primarily used to pay land acquisition deposits of of 69 million and decreases in funds used to pay accounts payable of 29 million 

net cash used in investing activities decreased for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to decreases in capital expenditures and acquisitions and proceeds from the sale of assets our capital expenditures are primarily related to acquiring land opening and improving facilities capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements acquiring yard equipment and lease buyouts of certain facilities we continue to develop expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations as of july 31 2021 we have no material noncancelable commitments for future capital expenditures capitalized software development costs were 136 million 132 million and 84 million for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies 

net cash provided by used in financing activities changed from a use of cash to providing cash in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to lower payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings as discussed in further detail under the subheading “stock repurchases”and the notes to consolidated financial statements note 11 — stockholders’ equity and lower debt issuance costs for the restructuring of our revolving loan facility as discussed in further detail in notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  

for a discussion of fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 please refer to part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended july 31 2020 filed with the sec on september 28 2020  

stock repurchases 

on september 22 2011 our board of directors approved an 80 million share increase in the stock repurchase program bringing the total current authorization to 196 million shares the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions no time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program subject to applicable securities laws such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time for fiscal 2021 and 2020 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the program for fiscal 2019 we repurchased 7635596 shares of our common stock under the program at a weighted average price of 4781 per share totaling 3650 million as of july 31 2021 the total number of shares repurchased under the program was 114549198 and 81450802 shares were available for repurchase under our program 

in fiscal 2019 our former president exercised all of his vested stock options through a cashless exercise in fiscal 2020 our chief executive officer exercised all of his vested stock options through a cashless exercise in fiscal 2021 certain employees exercised stock options through a cashless exercise a portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price we remitted 38 million 1013 million and 456 million during the years ended july 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees’ statutory withholding requirements 

the exercised stock options utilizing a cashless exercise are summarized in the following table 



1 shares withheld for taxes are treated as a repurchase of shares for accounting purposes but do not count against our stock repurchase program 

credit agreement 

on july 21 2020 we entered into a first amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association truist bank as successor by merger to suntrust bank bmo harris bank na santander bank na and bank of america na as administrative agent as amended from time to time the “credit amendment” bringing the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit commitments under the credit agreement  the “revolving loan facility” to 10500 million 

the carrying amount of the credit agreement is comprised of borrowings under which interest accrues under a fluctuating interest rate structure accordingly the carrying value approximated fair value at july 31 2021 and was classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy 

the interest rate as of july 31 2021 on our revolving loan facility was the eurodollar rate of 075 plus an applicable margin of 150 amounts borrowed under the revolving loan facility may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date of july 21 2023 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan facility as of july 31 2021 or 2020 the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and we were in compliance with all covenants related to the credit agreement as of july 31 2021 

note purchase agreement 

on december 3 2014 we entered into a note purchase agreement and sold to certain purchasers collectively the “purchasers” 4000 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes the “senior notes” consisting of i 1000 million aggregate principal amount of 407 senior notes series a due december 3 2024 ii 1000 million aggregate principal amount of 419 senior notes series b due december 3 2026 iii 1000 million aggregate principal amount of 425 senior notes series c due december 3 2027 and iv 1000 million aggregate principal amount of 435 senior notes series d due december 3 2029 interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears on each of the senior notes we may prepay the senior notes in whole or in part at any time subject to certain conditions including minimum amounts and payment of a makewhole amount equal to the discounted value of the remaining scheduled interest payments under the senior notes the note purchase agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and we were in compliance with all covenants related to the note purchase agreement as of july 31 2021 

for further detail on both the credit agreement and note purchase agreement see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2021 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements pursuant to item 303a4 of regulation sk promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we consider the following policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for additional information see note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item i “financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process service revenue and vehicle sales revenue are recognized at the date the vehicles are sold at auction excluding annual registration fees costs to prepare the vehicles for auction including inbound transportation costs and titling fees are deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition at auction 

our disaggregation between service revenues and vehicle sales at the segment level reflects how the nature timing amount and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are impacted by economic factors we report sales taxes on relevant transactions on a net basis in our consolidated results of operations and therefore do not include sales taxes in revenues or costs 

service revenues 

our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services within this revenue category our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these services are not distinct within the context of the contract accordingly revenue for these services is recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied at the completion of the auction process we do not take ownership of these consigned vehicles which are stored at our facilities located throughout the us and at its international locations these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged 

we have a separate performance obligation related to providing access to our online auction platform we charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our online auctions and access our bidding platform this fee is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement generally one year as each day of access to the online auction platform represents the best depiction of the transfer of the service 

no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return or warranty although we provide for credit loss expense in the case of nonperformance by our buyers or sellers 



vehicle sales 

certain vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf we have a single performance obligation related to the sale of these vehicles which is the completion of the online auction process vehicle sales revenue is recognized on the auction date as we act as a principal in vehicle sales transactions the gross sales price at auction is recorded as revenue 



contract assets 

we capitalize certain contract assets related to obtaining a contract where the amortization period for the related asset is greater than one year these assets are amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship contract assets are classified as current or longterm other assets based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the related revenues and are amortized as an offset to the associated revenues on a straightline basis we assess these costs for impairment at least quarterly and as “triggering” events occur that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the contract asset costs where the amortization period for the related asset is one year or less are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

uncertain tax positions 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities in the ordinary course of global business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain in addition our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic political and other conditions such as new covid19 variants 

our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions in addition a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals 

the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws and significant judgment is necessary to i determine whether based on the technical merits a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and ii measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition development in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as of july 31 2021 as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2021 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2021 a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement were zero as of july 31 2021 the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement bears interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050 or iii the eurodollar rate plus 10 subject to an interest rate floor of 075 in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 050 to 125 based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 150 to 225 depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of eurodollar rate loans if interest rates were to increase by 10 it would not materially affect our operating results 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 110 million for fiscal 2021 

on january 29 2020 the european parliament approved the uk’s withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk officially left the european union on january 31 2020 although we have not experienced any material disruptions in our business as a result of brexit to date the ultimate effects of brexit on us are still difficult to predict and adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future 

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2021 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of 1009 million this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states “us” canada the united kingdom “uk” brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates “uae” oman bahrain and spain 

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us with respect to our environmental stewardship we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global reuse and recycling of vehicles parts and raw materials we are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers each vehicle that enters our business operations is an existing fact with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacture are already sunk costs however upon our receipt of an existing vehicle we help decrease its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing for example many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to drivable condition reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs again 

reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing and finally some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping reducing the need for further new resource extraction in each of these cases our business reduces the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry 

beyond our environmental stewardship we also support the world’s communities in two important ways first we believe that we contribute to economic development and wellbeing by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world for example many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education health care and wellbeing more generally secondly because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve for example we mobilized our people entered into emergency leases and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve store and remarket tens of thousands of flooddamaged vehicles in the houston texas metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane harvey in the summer of 2017 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and from individuals we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some jurisdictions to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland finland the uae oman and bahrain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction such as delivery and storage in the uk germany and spain we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured

we believe our virtual auction platform increases the pool of available buyers for each sale which brings added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improves the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements which would be associated with holding live auctions

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price occasionally companies in our industry purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based on the vehicles’ estimated preaccident value “pav” and the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and released to the buyer while companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction or a hybrid internet and physical auction we sell virtually all our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and from individuals our primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

the primary buyers of vehicles at our auctions are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some jurisdictions the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers based on volume of vehicles purchased either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

most of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident or to a lesser extent a natural disaster typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its pav otherwise known as actual cash value “acv” the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the pav less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer systems advanced cameras collision warning systems and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

• the anticipated percentage return on salvage ie gross salvage proceeds minus vehicle handling and selling expenses divided by the pav 

• the services provided by the company and the degree to which such services reduce their administrative costs and expenses 

• the price the company charges for its services 

• geographic coverage 

• the ability to respond to natural disasters 

• the ability to provide analytical data to the seller and 

• in the uk in certain situations the actual amount paid for the vehicle 

in the uk some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles under these circumstances insurance companies will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order the assignment we arrange for the transportation of a vehicle to our nearest facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold at auction on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member typically seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller

members 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered members “buyers” in the vehicle dismantling and recycling rebuilding used vehicle dealer and export industries as well as members that are a part of the general public where applicable we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing members with a variety of programs and services to become a registered member a person or business must complete a basic application either online or through our mobile applications before any member may purchase a vehicle they must provide copies of current government issued photo identification additionally business members must provide current business information including copies of licenses which may include vehicle dismantler dealer resale repair or export licenses and as needed completed sales tax exemption certificates registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements in certain jurisdictions we may sell to the general public either directly or members may purchase a vehicle offered at copart through a registered broker who meets local licensing and permitting requirements strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that will not result in a completed sale we market to members online and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing direct mail inlocation marketing search engines social media radio television trade publications and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in the us include insurance auto auctions inc “iaa” kar auction services inc “kar” including its subsidiary adesa inc auction broadcasting company llc and manheim inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation “lkq” lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in our international markets our principal competitors are vehicle auction and sales companies vehicle dismantlers and privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary yard management information system consists of a series of ibm as400 mainframe computer systems and other servers which run our proprietary software developed to process salvage sales vehicles throughout the auction process this system is integrated with the internet to enable buyers to view salvage vehicles and bid on them it can also be integrated with the seller’s system and enables the sellers to monitor their vehicles and analyze the progression of vehicles through the auction process our auctionstyle service product vb3 is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with certain of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we expect the worldwide covid19 pandemic to have an adverse impact on our nearterm revenues principally as a result of lower auction inventories the geographic extent length and economic impact of the pandemic is unknown but we expect it will adversely affect our business and operating results 

we saw substantial declines in vehicle assignments which we attribute principally to reduced accident volume as miles driven dramatically declined in response to shelterinplace orders across the globe as we do not recognize the majority of our transactional revenues until the completion of our auctions a substantial portion of the declines in assignments we experienced in the most recent quarter will be reflected in future quarters we cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop whether and to what extent new shelterinplace orders will be issued or to what extent the pandemic may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our markets including for example the risk of longterm reductions in miles driven to the extent that the pandemic results in temporary or longerterm declines in the number of vehicles we process our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

although we have been deemed an “essential business” in the jurisdictions in which we operate and have largely been able to continue our yard operations we have been required to make adjustments in our business processes that may reduce efficiency or increase operating expenses particularly if the pandemic continues over a long period of time to date we have not made modifications that materially affect our operating expenses and while we regularly monitor them we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed to align revenues and operating expenses when necessary which could result in a drop in our stock price as a result of our operating or net income for one or more fiscal periods being less than market expectations additional nonexclusive examples of pandemicrelated factors that could adversely affect our future business or operating results include the potential adverse operational impacts from outbreaks of covid19 at any of our locations “second wave” outbreaks of covid19 in one or more of our geographic markets a reduction in miles driven due to one or more factors 

relating to the covid19 pandemic any further government actions in response to covid19 outbreaks that restrict business activity or travel disruptions of governmental administrative operations due to covid19 outbreaks that adversely impact our core business activities such as vehicle title processing and deteriorating economic conditions generally 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

although no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020 a limited number of vehicle sellers historically have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected revenues in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside the us including expansions in europe brazil and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired or operational capabilities established outside the us could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside the us in fiscal 2003 with an acquisition in canada subsequently in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we made significant acquisitions in the uk followed by acquisitions in the uae brazil germany and spain in fiscal 2013 expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015 expansion into the republic of ireland and india in fiscal 2016 and an acquisition in finland in fiscal 2018 in addition we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside of the us acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside of the us pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards and operations acquiring buyers and sellers and implementing shared services capabilities in international markets among other things we plan to ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally for example although we continue to operate a technology and operations center in india for administrative support we decided to suspend our salvage operations in india in fiscal 2018 which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position until the indian market develops in a manner better suited to our business model 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results moreover success in opening and operating facilities in new markets can be dependent upon establishing new relationships with buyers and sellers and our failure to establish those relationships could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

• the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices 

• the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations 

• the need to localize our product offerings particularly the need to implement our online auction platform in foreign countries 

• the need to comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations 

• tariffs trade barriers trade disputes and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets 

• exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and revenue growth rates 

• adapting to different business cultures languages and market structures particularly where we seek to implement our auction model in markets where insurers have historically not played a substantial role in the disposition of salvage vehicles 

• repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates 

• military actions 

• public health issues 

• environmental issues 

• natural and manmade disasters and 

• political issues 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

on january 29 2020 the european parliament approved the uk’s withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk officially left the european union on january 31 2020 and entered into a transition period that is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 during which the uk’s trading relationship with the european union is expected to remain largely the same while the two parties negotiate a trade agreement as well as other aspects of the uk’s relationship with the european union the ultimate effects of brexit on us are difficult to predict but adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the competition and markets authority uk regulator if an inquiry is made by the uk regulator we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulator will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the uk regulator determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulator the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

our business activities and public policy interests expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

our business activities facilities expansions and civic and public policy interests may be unpopular in certain communities exposing us to reputational and political risk for example public opposition in some communities to different aspects of our business operations has impacted our ability to obtain required business use permits additionally our interests in legislative and regulatory processes at different levels of government in the geographies in which we operate have been opposed by competitors and other interest groups although we believe we generally enjoy positive community relationships and political support in our range of operations shifting public opinion sentiments and sociopolitical dynamics could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in some cases the enforcement practices of governmental regulators in certain foreign areas and the procedural and substantive rights and remedies available to us may vary significantly from those in the united states which could have an adverse effect on our business 

although we face risks associated with international expansion in each of the nonus markets where we operate our current focus on the german market heightens the risks we face relating to our expansion plans in germany 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not until our acquisition been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” uk bribery act brazil clean companies act india’s prevention of corruption act 1988 or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the us market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in the us 

some of our target markets outside the us operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in the us for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased and then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in the us in which we generally act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in the us canada and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets including germany insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside the us canada and the uk including germany in particular we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

acquisitions typically will increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions to date most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

we have developed a new proprietary enterprise operating system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we continue to design and develop this system 

we have developed a new proprietary enterprise operating system to address our international expansion needs the ongoing design development and implementation of our enterprise operating systems carries certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the transition to our internally developed proprietary system will continue to require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance 

that the volume of business will increase we began using our internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 

we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due among other things to slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the impairment of internally developed capitalized software costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

disruptions to our information technology systems including failure to prevent outages maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems and other confidential information could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

information availability and security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of in addition to other factors the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees in addition human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to information technology system disruptions andor cyberattacks including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system phishing attacks or other information technology data security incidents 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control 

information technology system disruptions cyberattacks or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation operating results or financial condition by among other things making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time damaging our reputation with buyers sellers and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including account data information or resulting in governmental investigations litigation liability fines or penalties against us if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of these cyber risks our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation 

we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions these attempts have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business for example in april 2015 we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to data provided to us by our members that is considered to be personal information in certain jurisdictions we immediately investigated including the engagement of an external expert security firm and made the required notifications to members whose information may have been accessed and to regulatory agencies 

we are regularly evaluating and implementing new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyberattacks and system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes we have further enhanced our security protocols based on the investigation we conducted in response to the security incident nevertheless we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address prior data security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future data security incidents or system failures will be successful the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyberattacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future if our systems are compromised again in the future become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet and other points of access while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and other obligations regarding privacy and data protection 

we are subject to federal state and international laws directives and regulations relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personal data these laws directives and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in the european union on may 25 2018 applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the european union and may also apply to related products and services that we offer to european union users similarly the california consumer privacy act or ab375 “ccpa” and the brazilian general data protection law “lgpd” were also recently enacted and became effective in 2020 and these laws create new data privacy rights for individuals complying with the gdpr the ccpa and similar emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices noncompliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties legal proceedings by governmental entities or others and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to retain and attract customers any of the risks described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in the us canada and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

we implemented our online system across all of our us canada and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in those markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in the us canada and the uk however we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita sandy and harvey had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate and seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2018 we opened three new operational facilities in the us a new operational facility in the uk a new operational facility in germany and acquired four locations in finland in fiscal 2019 we opened one new operational facility in brazil seven new operational facilities in germany and eleven new operational facilities in the us and acquired an operational facility in greenville kentucky in fiscal 2020 we opened two new operational facilities in germany one new operational facility in brazil and three new operational facilities in the us acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

• continue to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms 

• expand existing facilities in nogrowth regulatory environments 

• obtain or retain buyers sellers and sales volumes in new markets or facilities 

• increase revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities 

• maintain the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions 

• create new vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and profitability requirements or 

• obtain necessary regulatory approvals under applicable antitrust and competition laws 

in addition certain of the acquisition agreements under which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their 

indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

• hire train and manage additional qualified personnel 

• establish new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle sellers 

• identify and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms 

• secure adequate capital and 

• maintain the supply of vehicles from vehicle sellers 

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

• fluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles 

• fluctuations in commodity prices particularly the per ton price of crushed car bodies 

• the impact of foreign exchange gain and loss as a result of international operations 

• our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations in international markets and any additional markets we may enter 

• the availability of salvage vehicles or other vehicles we sell 

• variations in vehicle accident rates 

• member participation in the internet bidding process 

• delays or changes in state title processing 

• changes in international state or federal laws regulations or treaties affecting the vehicles we sell 

• changes in the application interpretation and enforcement of existing laws regulations or treaties 

• trade disputes and other political diplomatic legal or regulatory developments 

• inconsistent application or enforcement of laws or regulations by regulators governmental or quasigovernmental entities or law enforcement or quasilaw enforcement agencies as compared to our competitors 

• changes in laws affecting who may purchase the vehicles we sell 

• the timing and size of our new facility openings 

• the announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors 

• the severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure 

• the availability and cost of general business insurance 

• labor costs and collective bargaining 

• changes in the current levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles 

• the introduction of a similar internet product by a competitor 

• the ability to obtain or maintain necessary permits to operate 

• military actions 

• natural and manmade disasters 

• public health issues including covid19 and other pandemics and 

• political issues 

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely primarily upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure accidents and related injury claims availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to our different lines of insurance coverage including without limitation medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate more than 10 of our common stock as of july 31 2020 if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer and jeffrey liaw our president and acting chief financial officer or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

cash investments are subject to risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these investmentrelated risk items may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

• enhance our existing services 

• develop access acquire and license new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers and 

• respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a costeffective and timely basis 

developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker and copart lounge programs through which registered members can open copart storefronts in foreign markets with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public will involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived these programs could also create additional risks including heightened regulation and litigation risk related to vehicle sales to the general public and heightened branding reputational and intellectual property risk associated with allowing copart registered members to establish copartbranded storefronts in foreign jurisdictions 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle supply only a portion of which are referred to as inventory which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our salvage vehicle supply will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2006 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2018 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricanes katrina rita sandy and harvey weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory and included premiums for subhaulers payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other 

anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices declines in used car prices and vehiclerelated technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates whether due to among other things a reduction in miles driven per car vehiclerelated technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and to the extent widely adopted the advent of autonomous vehicles could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts which we refer to as pip the cost of transporting the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in transportation rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage and other vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk and other foreign markets the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

regulation of the vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of laws regulations and ordinances these include without limitation land use ordinances business and occupational licensure requirements and procedures vehicle titling sales and registration rules and procedures and laws and regulations relating to the environment antimoney laundering anticorruption exporting and reporting and notification requirements to agencies and law enforcement relating to vehicle transfers many of these laws and regulations are frequently complex and subject to interpretation and failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations may result in impairment or suspension of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we may be subject to similar types of regulations by governmental agencies in new markets in addition new legal or regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of vehicle buyers may decrease demand for our vehicles and may adversely impact our ability to conduct business 

changes in laws or the interpretation of laws including foreign laws and regulations affecting the import and export of vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base as a result our foreign buyers may be subject to a variety of foreign laws and regulations including the imposition of import duties by foreign countries changes in laws regulations and treaties that restrict or impede or negatively affect the economics surrounding the importation of vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base in addition we and our vehicle buyers must work with foreign customs agencies and other nonus governmental officials who are responsible for the interpretation application and enforcement of these laws regulations and treaties any inability to obtain requisite approvals or agreements from such authorities could adversely impact the ability of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries in addition any disputes or disagreements with foreign agencies or officials over import duties tariffs or similar matters including disagreements over the value assigned to imported vehicles could adversely affect our costs and the ability and costs of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad changes in the interpretation application and enforcement of laws regulations or treaties any failure to comply with nonus laws or regulatory interpretations or any legal or regulatory interpretations or governmental actions that significantly increase our costs or the costs of our buyers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services and our ability to compete in nonus markets 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national international provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities requiring us to actively monitor and manage potential environmental impacts in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations in addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions we also take such actions as may be necessary under laws in the us to avoid liability for activities of prior owners and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks there can be no assurances however that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities we have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us in addition to acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions we have also obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations as of july 31 2020 the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was 3436 million 

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge in the period the determination is made the annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed qualitatively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 considered all relevant factors specific to our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance the impact of the covid19 pandemic and relevant entityspecific events changes in these factors or changes in actual performance could affect the fair value of goodwill which may result in an impairment charge for example deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets we considered the above factors noting none involved significant uncertainty our calculated fair value exceeded carrying value for each reporting unit by a substantial amount in our previous quantitative analysis indicating no material risk as of july 31 2020 with respect to potential goodwill impairments should the value of our goodwill become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

changes in federal state and local or foreign tax laws changing interpretations of existing tax laws or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state provincial and local levels in the us the uk and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate including income taxes sales taxes valueadded “vat” taxes and similar taxes and assessments the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe our tax positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united states hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom state tax authorities in the states in which we operate and other similar tax authorities in international jurisdictions we have been subject to audits and challenges from applicable federal state or foreign tax authorities in past and may be subject to similar audits and challenges in the future while we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes interest and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities 

new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” or “tax act” was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act significantly revamped us taxation of corporations including a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 a repeal of the exceptions to the 10 million deduction limitation for performancebased compensation to covered employees and a new tax regime for foreign earnings any subsequent repeal of the tax act could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations many of the provisions of the tax act are highly complex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the irs or others some of the provisions of the tax act may be changed by a future congress or challenged by the world trade organization “wto” although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance or actions by a future congress or wto they could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

on january 29 2020 the european parliament approved the uk’s withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk officially left the european union on january 31 2020 and entered into a transition period that is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 during which the uk’s trading relationship with the european union is expected to remain largely the same while the two parties negotiate a trade agreement as well as other aspects of the uk’s relationship with the european union the ultimate effects of brexit on us are difficult to predict but adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states “us” canada the united kingdom “uk” brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates “uae” oman bahrain and spain 

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us with respect to our environmental stewardship we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global reuse and recycling of vehicles parts and raw materials we are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers each vehicle that enters our business operations is an existing fact with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacture are already sunk costs however upon our receipt of an existing vehicle we help decrease its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing for example many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to drivable condition reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing and finally some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping reducing the need for further new resource extraction in each of these cases our business reduces the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry 

beyond our environmental stewardship we also support the world’s communities in two important ways first we believe that we contribute to economic development and wellbeing by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world for example many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education health care and wellbeing more generally secondly because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve for example we mobilized our people entered into emergency leases and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve store and remarket tens of thousands of flooddamaged vehicles in the houston texas metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane harvey in the summer of 2017 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and from individuals we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some jurisdictions to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland finland the uae oman and bahrain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction such as delivery and storage in the uk germany and spain we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own we have certain contracts with insurance companies primarily in the uk in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by several factors including total loss frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price as a significant amount of our service revenue is associated in some manner with the ultimate selling price of the vehicle vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by i market demand for rebuildable drivable vehicles ii used car pricing which we also believe has an impact on total loss frequency iii end market demand for recycled and refurbished parts as reflected in demand from dismantlers iv the mix of cars sold v changes in the us dollar exchange rate to foreign currencies which we believe has an impact on auction participation by international buyers and vi changes in commodity prices particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies as we believe this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling we cannot specifically quantify the financial impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles our service revenues or financial results total loss frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repair costs used car values and auction returns over the last several years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in total loss frequency the increase in total loss frequency may have been driven by the change in used car values and repair costs which we believe are generally trending upward changes in used car prices and repair costs may impact total loss frequency and affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road the average age of cars on the road continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 119 years in 2020 repair costs are generally based on damage severity vehicle complexity repair parts availability repair parts costs labor costs and repair shop lead times the factors that can influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in total loss frequency 

beginning in march 2020 our business and operations began to experience the impact of the worldwide covid19 pandemic first within our european operations and as the month progressed throughout the balance of our global operations in materially all of our jurisdictions we have been deemed by local authorities an essential business because our operations ensure the removal of vehicles from repair shops impound yards and streets and highways enabling the critical function of road infrastructure as a result we have continued to operate our facilities as well as our onlineonly auctions while following appropriate health and safety protocols to ensure safe working conditions for our employees as well as for our sellers buyers and other business partners with whom we come in contact 

from a financial perspective our operating results were adversely affected by lower processed vehicle volume during the last five months of the year ended july 31 2020 we saw substantial declines in vehicle assignments which we attribute principally to reduced accident volume as miles driven dramatically declined in response to shelterinplace orders across the globe as we do not recognize the majority of our transactional revenues until the completion of our auctions a substantial portion of the declines in assignments we experienced in the most recent quarter will be reflected in future quarters we cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop whether and to what extent new shelterinplace orders will be issued or to what extent the pandemic may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our markets including for example the risk of longterm reductions in miles driven to the extent that the pandemic results in temporary or longerterm declines in the number of vehicles we process our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

although we have been deemed an “essential business” in the jurisdictions in which we operate and have largely been able to continue our yard operations we have been required to make adjustments in our business processes that may reduce efficiency or increase operating expenses particularly if the pandemic continues over a long period of time we adjusted but did not make material modifications to our operating expenses to be able to continue providing employment for our employees service to our sellers and process incoming vehicles for sale in future quarters we expect the pandemic to have an adverse effect on our quarterly revenues in future quarters with the magnitude and timing of these effects dependent upon the extent and duration of suspended economic activity across our markets the longerterm impact on our business will depend on potential adverse operational impacts from outbreaks of covid19 at any of our locations “second wave” outbreaks of covid19 in one or more of our geographic markets a reduction in miles driven due to one or more factors relating to the covid19 pandemic any further government actions in response to covid19 outbreaks that restrict business activity or travel disruptions of governmental administrative operations due to covid19 outbreaks that adversely impact our core business activities such as vehicle title processing and deteriorating economic conditions generally and the potential availability among other things of vaccines or treatments none of which we can predict for a further discussion of risks to our business and operating results arising from the pandemic please see the section of this annual report on form 10k captioned “risk factors” 

on march 20 2020 we filed a current report on form 8k to announce our draw down of funds under our available credit facilities in order to ensure financial flexibility given current uncertainties we subsequently repaid all outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of july 31 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 4777 million an increase of 3842 million over january 31 2020 and had 15 billion of liquidity these incremental available cash equivalents may be used for investments in land technology acquisitions working capital share repurchases or general corporate purposes as permitted by the applicable credit agreements 

operating costs and expenses yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent vehicle transportation insurance property related taxes fuel equipment maintenance and repair marketing costs directly related to the auction process and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel professional services marketing expenses and system maintenance and enhancements 

other income and expense other income primarily includes foreign exchange rate gains and losses and gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period other expense consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt 

liquidity and cash flows our primary source of working capital is cash operating results and debt financing the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and revolving loan facility the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v total loss frequency vi volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix xi contract mix to the extent applicable xii our capital expenditures and other macroeconomic factors such as covid19 these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital and liquidity are the sale of assets or the issuance of shares through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital and liquidity is the issuance of additional debt with new lenders and equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future or on commercially acceptable terms 

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in the us canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain with the intention of providing global coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following tables set forth operational facilities that we have opened and began operations from august 1 2017 through july 31 2020 





the following table sets forth operational facilities obtained through business acquisitions from august 1 2017 through july 31 2020 



the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets including foreign markets ii pursuing global national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

service revenues the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2020 of 1914 million or 109 as compared to fiscal 2019 came from i an increase in the us of 1773 million and ii an increase in international of 142 million the increase in the us was driven primarily by i increased volume and ii an increase in revenue per car due to higher average auction selling prices the increase in volume in the us was derived from i growth in the number of units sold from new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and ii growth from existing suppliers driven by what we believe was an increase in total loss frequency excluding the detrimental impact of 69 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound and brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates the increase in international of 211 million was driven primarily by increased revenue per car 

the following table presents a comparison of vehicle sales for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 



vehicle sales the decrease in vehicle sales for fiscal 2020 of 278 million or 97 as compared to fiscal 2019 came from i a decrease in international of 546 million partially offset by ii an increase in the us of 268 million excluding a detrimental impact of 24 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound and european union euro to us dollar exchange rates the decline in international of 522 million was primarily the result of decreased volume driven by contractual shift from purchase contracts to fee based service contracts and a change in mix of vehicles sold the increase in the us was primarily the result of increased volume and higher average auction selling prices which we believe was due to a change in the mix of vehicles sold and increased demand 

the following table presents a comparison of yard operations expense for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 



yard operations expenses the increase in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2020 of 844 million or 95 as compared to fiscal 2019 resulted from i an increase in the us of 761 million primarily from growth in volume an increase in the cost to process each car and a 135 million increase in depreciation and ii an increase in international of 82 million related primarily from an increase in the cost to process each car partially offset by the beneficial impact of 41 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound brazilian real and european union euro to us dollar exchange rate the increase in yard operations depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from depreciating new and expanded facilities placed into service in the us 

the following table presents a comparison of cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 



cost of vehicle sales  the decrease in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2020 of 302 million or 118 as compared to fiscal 2019 was the result of i a decrease in international of 530 million and ii an increase in the us of 228 million excluding the beneficial impact of 19 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and european euro to us dollar exchange rate the decrease in international of 549 million was primarily the result of decreased volume driven by contractual shifts from purchase contracts to fee based service contracts and a change in the mix of vehicles sold the increase in the us was primarily the result of increased volume and higher average purchase prices which we believe is due to a change in the mix of vehicles sold and increased demand 

the following table presents a comparison of general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 



general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 of 98 million or 54 as compared to fiscal 2019 came primarily from an increase in international of 127 million partially offset by a decrease in the us of 28 million excluding depreciation and amortization the increase in international of 120 million resulted primarily from our international growth strategy through the expansion of our european businesses partially offset by the beneficial impact of 17 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound brazilian real and european union euro to us dollar exchange rate excluding depreciation and amortization the decrease in the us of 49 million resulted primarily from decreases in legal and travel costs and higher capitalizable software development partially offset by increases in payroll taxes from the exercise of employee stock options and by supporting our continued growth initiatives 

the following table summarizes impairment total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 



other expenses the increase in total other expenses for fiscal 2020 of 37 million or 324 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower gains on the disposal of certain nonoperating assets in the current year and losses of unconsolidated affiliates partially offset by an increase in currency gains primarily due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate 

income taxes our effective income tax rates were 126 161 and 257 for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the current year’s effective tax rate was computed based on the us federal statutory tax rate of 210 for the fiscal year ending july 31 2020 and was negatively impacted by 17 million of discrete tax items related to amending previously filed income tax returns the prior year’s effective tax rate was computed based on the us federal statutory tax rate of 210 for the fiscal year ending july 31 2019 and was favorably impacted by 102 million of discrete tax items related to amending previously filed income tax returns the effective tax rates in the current and prior years were also impacted from the result of recognizing excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options of 925 million 461 million and 213 million for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 excluding additional funds available to us through our revolving loan facility 





cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and working capital increased 2914 million and 2026 million at july 31 2020 respectively as compared july 31 2019 cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings and capital expenditures working capital increased primarily from cash generated from operations and timing of cash receipts and payments partially offset by capital expenditures our operating lease liabilities certain income tax benefits related to stock option exercises and timing of cash payments cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits domestic certificates of deposit and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of service fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales we expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business in addition to our stock repurchase program we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash balances and our cash flows from operations these alternative potential uses include additional stock repurchases repayments of longterm debt the payment of dividends and acquisitions for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt and note 11 — stockholders’ equity and under the subheadings “ credit agreement ” and “ note purchase agreement ” below 

our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the winter months most of our facilities process 5 to 20 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months we expect to acquire or develop additional locations and expand some of our current facilities in the foreseeable future we may be required to raise additional cash through drawdowns on our revolving loan facility or issuance of additional equity to fund this expansion although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business costs to develop a new yard can range from 30 to 500 million depending on size location and developmental infrastructure requirements 

as of july 31 2020 1248 million of the 4777 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us the repatriation of these funds could still be subject to the foreign withholding tax following the us tax reform however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not require repatriation to fund our us operations 

net cash used in operating activities increased for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to improved cash operating results from an increase in service revenues partially offset by an increase in yard operations and general and administrative expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase of funds received on accounts receivables of 768 million decreases in funds used to pay accounts payable of 305 million cash generated from the sale of inventory of 251 million decreases in funds primarily used to pay land acquisition deposits of of 124 million and partially offset by net income taxes receivable of 36 million primarily related to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises 

net cash used in investing activities increased for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to increases in capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities acquiring land opening and improving facilities capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements and acquiring yard equipment we continue to develop expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations as of july 31 2020 we have no material noncancelable commitments for future capital expenditures capitalized software development costs were 132 million 84 million and 74 million for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies 

net cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to lower repurchases of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program as discussed in further detail under the subheading “ stock repurchases ” and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings as discussed in further detail under the subheading “ stock repurchases ”and the notes to consolidated financial statements note 11 — stockholders’ equity debt issuance costs for the restructuring of our revolving loan facility as discussed in further detail under the subheading credit agreement  and payments on

contractual obligations 

we lease certain domestic and foreign facilities and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases in addition to the minimum future lease commitments presented the leases generally require us to pay property taxes insurance maintenance and repair costs which are not included in the table because we have determined these items are not material the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july 31 2020 





1 revolving loan facility payments of zero and related interest payments reflect management’s intent for the use of the revolving loan facility which may change on a quarter by quarter basis 

2 contractual obligations consist of future noncancelable minimum lease payments under finance and operating leases used in the normal course of business 

3 tax liabilities include the longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 

4 commercial commitments consist primarily of letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions including cash collateralized bank guarantees 

stock repurchases 

on september 22 2011 our board of directors approved an 80 million share increase in the stock repurchase program bringing the total current authorization to 196 million shares the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions no time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program subject to applicable securities laws such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time for fiscal 2020 and 2018 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the program for fiscal 2019 we repurchased 7635596 shares of our common stock under the program at a weighted average price of 4781 per share totaling 3650 million as of july 31 2020 the total number of shares repurchased under the program was 114549198 and 81450802 shares were available for repurchase under our program 

in fiscal 2018 certain members of our board of directors exercised stock options through cashless exercises during fiscal 2019 our former president exercised all of his vested stock options through a cashless exercise in fiscal 2020 our chief executive officer exercised all of his vested stock options through a cashless exercise a portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price we remitted 1013 million 456 million and no amounts for the years ended july 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees’ statutory withholding requirements 

the exercised stock options utilizing a cashless exercise are summarized in the following table 



1 shares withheld for taxes are treated as a repurchase of shares for accounting purposes but do not count against our stock repurchase program

our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process service revenue and vehicle sales revenue are recognized at the date the vehicles are sold at auction excluding annual registration fees costs to prepare the vehicles for auction including inbound transportation costs and titling fees are deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition at auction 

there were no contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at july 31 2020 our disaggregation between service revenues and vehicle sales at the segment level reflects how the nature timing amount and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are impacted by economic factors we report sales taxes on relevant transactions on a net basis in our consolidated results of operations and therefore do not include sales taxes in revenues or costs 

service revenues 

our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services within this revenue category our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these services are not distinct within the context of the contract accordingly revenue for these services is recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied at the completion of the auction process we do not take ownership of these consigned vehicles which are stored at our facilities located throughout the us and at its international locations these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged 

we have a separate performance obligation related to providing access to our online auction platform we charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our online auctions and access our bidding platform this fee is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement generally one year as each day of access to the online auction platform represents the best depiction of the transfer of the service 

no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return or warranty although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our buyers or sellers 



vehicle sales 

certain vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf we have a single performance obligation related to the sale of these vehicles which is the completion of the online auction process vehicle sales revenue is recognized on the auction date as we act as a principal in vehicle sales transactions the gross sales price at auction is recorded as revenue 



contract assets 

we capitalize certain contract assets related to obtaining a contract where the amortization period for the related asset is greater than one year these assets are amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship contract assets are classified as current or longterm other assets based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the related revenues and are amortized as an offset to the associated revenues on a straightline basis we assess these costs for impairment at least quarterly and as “triggering” events occur that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the contract asset costs where the amortization period for the related asset is one year or less are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of income 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer costs that relate directly to the fulfillment of our contracts associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the end of the period we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation costs of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are inbound transportation costs titling fees certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if the allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed into yard operations expenses as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in us gaap in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update “asu” 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

level i observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets 

level ii inputs other than quoted prices included within level i that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly 

level iii inputs that are generally unobservable these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate 

the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities and revolving loan facility approximated their fair values for fiscal 2020 and 2019 due to the shortterm nature of those instruments and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt and note 9 – fair value measures  

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life generally three to seven years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that impact the recoverability of these assets total gross capitalized software as of july 31 2020 and 2019 was 526 million and 394 million respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software as of july 31 2020 and 2019 totaled 335 million and 236 million respectively during the year ended july 31 2018 we retired fully amortized capitalized software of 155 million which were no longer being utilized 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our reporting units annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis the annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed qualitatively during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 considered all relevant factors specific to our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance the impact of the covid19 pandemic and relevant entityspecific events management considered the above factors noting none involved significant uncertainty in addition the industry in which we operate improved over the observable period and our calculated fair value exceeded carrying value for each reporting unit by a substantial amount in our prior year quantitative analysis indicating no material risk as of july 31 2020 with respect to potential goodwill impairments 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes “asc 740” we are subject to income taxes in the us canada the uk brazil spain finland germany and other emerging markets around the world in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate then we analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we consider the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law as of july 31 2020 we have 154 million of valuation allowance arising from both our us and international operations to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision the repatriation of our accumulated foreign earnings could also affect our effective tax rate nevertheless we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations and do not anticipate the need for any of our foreign subsidiaries’ cash in the us operations accordingly we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740  pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest 

benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc 740 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method as required by asc 718 compensation—stock compensation “asc 718” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased awards made to employees consultants and directors based on estimated fair value asc 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of stockbased awards on the measurement date using an optionpricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized in expense over the requisite service periods asc 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

the fair value of each option without a marketbased condition was estimated on the measurement date using the blackscholes merton “bsm” optionpricing model for options that included a marketbased condition the monte carlo simulation model was used the bsm option pricing model utilizes assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

foreign currency translation 

we record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the us dollar reporting currency the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar are the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries as they are the primary currencies within the economic environment in which each subsidiary operates the original equity investment in the respective subsidiaries is translated at historical rates assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiary’s operations are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period adjustments resulting from the translation of each subsidiary’s financial statements are reported in other comprehensive income 

accounting for acquisitions 

we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquired entities in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  the allocation of the purchase consideration for acquisitions can require extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase consideration to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill critical estimates in valuing certain identifiable assets include but are not limited to expected longterm revenues future expected operating expenses cost of capital appropriate attrition and discount rates 

segment reporting 

our us and international regions are considered two separate operating segments and are disclosed as two reportable segments the segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results including total revenues and operating income our revenues for the year ended july 31 2020 were distributed as follows us 844 and international 156 geographic information as well as comparative segment revenues and related financial information pertaining to the us and international segments for the years ended july 31 2020 2019 and 2018 are presented in the tables in note 13 — segments and other geographic reporting  to the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as of july 31 2020 as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2020 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2020 a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement were zero as of july 31 2020 the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement bears interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050 or iii the eurodollar rate plus 10 subject to an interest rate floor of 075 in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 050 to 125 based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 150 to 225 depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of eurodollar rate loans if interest rates were to increase by 10 our interest expense would increase by 20 million 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 70 million for fiscal 2020 

on january 29 2020 the european parliament approved the uk’s withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk officially left the european union on january 31 2020 and entered into a transition period that is scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 during which the uk’s trading relationship with the european union is expected to remain largely the same while the two parties negotiate a trade agreement as well as other aspects of the uk’s relationship with the european union the ultimate effects of brexit on us are difficult to predict but adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2020 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of 1211 million this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain and spain  

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us with respect to our environmental stewardship we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global reuse and recycling of vehicles parts and raw materials many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to drivable condition reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing and finally some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping reducing the need for further de novo resource extraction in each case our business has reduced the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry 

beyond our environmental stewardship we also support the world’s communities in two important ways first we believe that we contribute to economic development and wellbeing by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world 

for example many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education health care and wellbeing more generally in addition because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve for example we mobilized our people entered into emergency leases and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve store and remarket tens of thousands of flooddamaged vehicles in the houston texas metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane harvey in the summer of 2017 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction such as delivery and storage in the uk and germany we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured 

through our virtual bidding third generation vb3 auction platform our sales process is open to registered buyers whom we refer to as “members” anywhere in the world with access to the internet this technology and model employ a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows members to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility or over the internet during the preview period to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb3 system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb3’s bid4u feature incrementally bids on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe our virtual auction platform increases the pool of available buyers for each sale which brings added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improves the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements which would be associated with holding live auctions 

for fiscal 2019  sales of us vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 552 of total vehicles sold of which 320 of vehicles were sold to out of state members within the us and 232 were sold to international members based on the address submitted during registration 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 



 

historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in the amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both members and sellers and v growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal 2019  our revenues were  20 billion and our operating income was  7165 million  

in fiscal 2017 we opened a new operational facility in germany a new operational facility in brazil nine new operational facilities in the us and acquired cycle express llc which conducts business primarily as national powersport auctions npa a leading nonsalvage auction platform for motorcycles snowmobiles watercraft and other powersports vehicles npa currently operates facilities in nine locations across the us

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price occasionally companies in our industry purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based on the vehicles’ estimated preaccident cash value and the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and delivered to the buyer while most companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction or a hybrid internet and physical auction we sell virtually all our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  our primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

the primary buyers of vehicles at our auctions are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some states the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers based on volume of vehicles purchased either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase 

salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

most of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident or to a lesser extent a natural disaster typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its preaccident value pav otherwise known as actual cash value acv the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the pav less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer systems advanced cameras collision warning systems and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

 

in the uk some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles under these circumstances insurance companies will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order the assignment we arrange for the transportation of a vehicle to our nearest facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold at auction on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member typically seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in the us include insurance auto auctions inc kar auction services inc including its subsidiary adesa inc auction broadcasting company llc and manheim inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation lkq lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in our international markets our principal competitors are vehicle auction and sales companies vehicle dismantlers and privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary yard management information system consists of a series of ibm as400 mainframe computer systems and other servers which run our proprietary software developed to process salvage sales vehicles throughout the auction process this system is integrated with the internet to enable buyers to view salvage vehicles and bid on them it can also be integrated with the seller’s system and enables the sellers to monitor their vehicles and analyze the progression of vehicles through the auction process our auctionstyle service product vb3 is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required

as of july 31 2019  we had 7327 fulltime employees of whom 1222 were engaged in general and administrative functions and 6105 were engaged in yard operations we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good employees per geographic region are as follows 



environmental matters 

our operations are subject to federal state national international provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations in addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions we also take such actions as may be necessary under laws in the united states to avoid liability for activities of prior owners and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks there can be no assurances however that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities we have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us in addition to acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions we have also obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and foreign motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in 2008 we obtained a patent issued by the united states patent and trademark office that covers certain aspects of our virtual bidding auction platform generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with certain of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

no single customer accounted for more than 10  of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2019  historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected revenues in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside the us including expansions in europe brazil and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired or operational capabilities established outside the us could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside the us in fiscal 2003 with an acquisition in canada subsequently in fiscal 2008 we made a significant acquisition in the uk followed by acquisitions in the uae brazil germany and spain in fiscal 2013 expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015 expansion into the republic of ireland and india in fiscal 2016 and an acquisition in finland in fiscal 2018 in addition we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside of the 

us acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside of the us pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards and operations acquiring buyers and sellers and implementing shared services capabilities in international markets among other things we plan to ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally for example although we continue to operate a technology and operations center in india for administrative support we decided to suspend our salvage operations in india in fiscal 2018 which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position until the indian market develops in a manner better suited to our business model 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results moreover success in opening and operating facilities in new markets can be dependent upon establishing new relationships with buyers and sellers and our failure to establish those relationships could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and discussions with the european union began in march 2017 the ultimate effects of brexit on us are difficult to predict but adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the competition and markets authority uk regulator if an inquiry is made by the uk regulator we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulator will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the uk regulator determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulator the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

our business activities and public policy interests expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

our business activities facilities expansions and civic and public policy interests may be unpopular in certain communities exposing us to reputational and political risk for example public opposition in some communities to different aspects of our business operations has impacted our ability to obtain required business use permits additionally our interests in legislative and regulatory processes at different levels of government in the geographies in which we operate have been opposed by competitors and other interest groups although we believe we generally enjoy positive community relationships and political support in our range of operations shifting public opinion sentiments and sociopolitical dynamics could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in some cases the enforcement practices of governmental regulators in certain foreign areas and the procedural and substantive rights and remedies available to us may vary significantly from those in the united states which could have an adverse effect on our business 

although we face risks associated with international expansion in each of the nonus markets where we operate our current focus on the german market heightens the risks we face relating to our expansion plans in germany 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not until our acquisition been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa uk bribery act brazil clean companies act india’s prevention of corruption act 1988 or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the us market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in the us 

some of our target markets outside the us operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in the us for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in the us in which we generally act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in the us canada and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets including germany insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside the us canada and the uk including germany in particular we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

acquisitions typically will increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions to date most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we continue to design and develop this system 

we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system to address our international expansion needs the ongoing design development and implementation of our enterprise operating systems carry certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the transition to our internally developed proprietary system will continue to require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance that the volume of business will increase we began using our internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 

we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due to among other things slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the impairment of internally developed capitalized software costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position for example during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

disruptions to our information technology systems including failure to prevent outages maintain security prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems and other confidential information could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

information availability and security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of in addition to other factors the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees in addition human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to information 

technology system disruptions andor cyberattacks including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system phishing attacks or other information technology data security incidents 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control 

information technology system disruptions cyberattacks or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation operating results or financial condition by among other things making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time damaging our reputation with buyers sellers and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including account data information or resulting in governmental investigations litigation liability fines or penalties against us if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of these cyber risks our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation 

we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions these attempts have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business for example in april 2015 we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to data provided to us by our members that is considered to be personal information in certain jurisdictions we immediately investigated including the engagement of an external expert security firm and made the required notifications to members whose information may have been accessed and to regulatory agencies 

we are constantly evaluating and implementing new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyberattacks and system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes we have further enhanced our security protocols based on the investigation we conducted in response to the security incident nevertheless we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address prior data security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future data security incidents or system failures will be successful the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyberattacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future if our systems are compromised again in the future become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet and other points of access while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could 

result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and other obligations regarding privacy and data protection 

we are subject to federal state and international laws directives and regulations relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personal data these laws directives and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction recent regulatory changes in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from europe to the united states for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in the european union “eu” on may 25 2018 applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu and may also apply to related products and services that we offer to eu users similarly the california consumer privacy act or ab375 “ccpa” and the brazilian general data protection law “lgpd” were also recently enacted and these laws create new data privacy rights for individuals both of which become effective in 2020 complying with the gdpr the ccpa and similar emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices noncompliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties legal proceedings by governmental entities or others and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to retain and attract customers any of the risks described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in the us canada and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

we implemented our online system across all of our us canada and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in those markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in the us canada and the uk however we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita sandy and harvey had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the united states we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2017 we opened a new operational facility in germany a new operational facility in brazil nine new operational facilities in the us and acquired cycle express llc which conducts business primarily as national powersport auctions npa a leading nonsalvage auction platform for motorcycles snowmobiles watercraft and other powersports vehicles npa currently operates facilities in nine locations across the us in fiscal 2018 we opened three new operational facilities in the us a new operational facility in the uk a new operational facility in germany and acquired locations in the municipalities of espoo pirkkala oulu and turku finland in fiscal 2019 we opened one new operational 

facility in brazil seven new operational facilities in germany and eleven new operational facilities in the us and acquired an operational facility in greenville kentucky acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

 

in addition certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

 

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 



 

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely primarily upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure accidents and related injury claims availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to our different lines of insurance coverage including without limitation medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate 153 of our common stock as of july 31 2019  if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman or a jayson adair our chief executive officer or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

cash investments are subject to risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public will involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle supply only a portion of which are referred to as inventory which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our salvage vehicle supply will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2006 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2018 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricanes katrina rita sandy and harvey weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory and included premiums for subhaulers payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices declines in used car prices and vehiclerelated technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates whether due to among other things a reduction in miles driven per car vehiclerelated technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and to the extent widely adopted the advent of autonomous vehicles could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts which we refer to as pip the cost of transporting the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in transportation rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage and other vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk and other foreign markets the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

federal state and local government regulation of the vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations among other laws and regulations we are subject at the state level to land use ordinances business licensure requirements and procedures vehicle registration rules and procedures and regulations relating to zoning and land use we are subject at the federal level to laws and regulations relating to the environment antimoney laundering anticorruption and reporting requirements to law enforcement relating to vehicle transfers many of these laws and regulations are frequently complex and subject to interpretation and failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws or the interpretation of laws including foreign laws and regulations affecting the import and export of vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base as a result our foreign buyers may be subject to a variety of foreign laws and regulations including the imposition of import duties by foreign countries changes in laws regulations and treaties that restrict or impede or negatively affect the economics surrounding the importation of vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base in addition we and our vehicle buyers must work with foreign customs agencies and other nonus governmental officials who are responsible for the interpretation application and enforcement of these laws regulations and treaties any inability to obtain requisite approvals or agreements from such authorities could adversely impact the ability of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries in addition any disputes or disagreements with foreign agencies or officials over import duties tariffs or similar matters including disagreements over the value assigned to imported vehicles could adversely affect our costs and the ability and costs of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad changes in the interpretation application and enforcement of laws regulations or treaties any failure to comply with nonus laws or regulatory interpretations or any legal or regulatory interpretations or governmental actions that significantly increase our costs or the costs of our buyers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services and our ability to compete in nonus markets 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national international provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations in addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions we also take such actions as may be necessary under laws in the united states to avoid liability for activities of prior owners and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks there can be no assurances however that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities we have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us in addition to 

acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions we have also obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations as of july 31 2019  the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was  3333 million  

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made the annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed qualitatively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  considered all relevant factors specific to our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events changes in these factors or changes in actual performance could affect the fair value of goodwill which may result in an impairment charge for example deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets we considered the above factors noting none involved significant uncertainty in addition the industry in which we operate improved over the observable period and our calculated fair value exceeded carrying value for each reporting unit by a substantial amount in our previous quantitative analysis indicating no material risk as of july 31 2019  with respect to potential goodwill impairments should the value of our goodwill become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

changes in federal state and local or foreign tax laws changing interpretations of existing tax laws or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state provincial and local levels in the united states the united kingdom and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate including income taxes sales taxes valueadded vat taxes and similar taxes and assessments the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe our tax positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united states hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom state tax authorities in the states in which we operate and other similar tax authorities in international jurisdictions as previously disclosed we have been subject to challenge by the georgia department of revenue with respect to sales taxes and could face similar audits or challenges from applicable federal state or foreign tax authorities in the future while we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes interest and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities 

new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” or “tax act” was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act significantly revamped us taxation of corporations including a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 a repeal of the exceptions to the 10 million deduction limitation for performancebased compensation to covered employees and a new tax regime for foreign earnings the repeal of the 10 million deduction limit for performancebased compensation the new us taxes on accumulated and future foreign earnings and other adverse changes resulting from the tax act or a change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings might offset the benefit from the reduced tax rate and our future effective tax rates andor cash taxes may increase even significantly or not decrease much compared to recent or historical trends many of the provisions of the tax act are highly complex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the irs or others some of the provisions of the tax act may be changed by a future congress or challenged by the world trade organization “wto” although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance or actions by a future congress or wto they could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and discussions with the european union began in march 2017 adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain and spain  

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us with respect to our environmental stewardship we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global reuse and recycling of vehicles parts and raw materials many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to drivable condition reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing and finally some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping reducing the need for further de novo resource extraction in each case our business has reduced the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry 

beyond our environmental stewardship we also support the world’s communities in two important ways first we believe that we contribute to economic development and wellbeing by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world for example many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education health care and wellbeing more generally in addition because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve for example we mobilized our people entered into emergency leases and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve store and remarket tens of thousands of flooddamaged vehicles in the houston texas metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane harvey in the summer of 2017 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 

we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction such as delivery and storage in the uk and germany we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own we have certain contracts with insurance companies primarily in the uk in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by several factors including total loss frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price as a significant amount of our service revenue is associated in some manner with the ultimate selling price of the vehicle vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by i changes in commodity prices particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies as we believe this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii used car pricing which we also believe has an impact on total loss frequency iii the mix of cars sold and iv changes in the us dollar exchange rate to foreign currencies which we believe has an impact on auction participation by international buyers we cannot specifically quantify the financial impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles our service revenues or financial results total loss frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repair costs used car values and auction returns over the last several years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in total loss frequency the increase in total loss frequency may have been driven by the decline in used car values relative to repair costs which we believe are generally trending upward conversely increases in used car prices such as occurred during the most recent recession may decrease total loss frequency and adversely affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road the average age of cars on the road continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 118 years in 2019 the factors that can influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in total loss frequency 

operating costs and expenses yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle transportation insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees information technology and marketing expenses 

other income and expense other income primarily includes income from the rental of certain real property foreign exchange rate gains and losses and gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period other expense consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 7 — longterm debt  

liquidity and cash flows our primary source of working capital is cash operating results and debt financing the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and revolving loan facility the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v total loss frequency vi increased volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix xi contract mix to the extent applicable and xii our capital expenditures these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of shares through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of additional debt with new lenders and equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future or on commercially acceptable terms 

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in the us canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain with the intention of providing national coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following tables set forth operational facilities that we have opened and began operations from august 1 2016 through july 31 2019  





the following table sets forth operational facilities obtained through business acquisitions from august 1 2016 through july 31 2019  



 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary 

results of operations 

the following table shows certain data from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  



comparison of fiscal years ended july 31 2019 and 2018 and 2017 

the following table presents a comparison of service revenues for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  



service revenues the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2019 of 1772 million  or 112 as compared to fiscal 2018 came from i an increase in the us of 1522 million and ii an increase in international of 250 million  the increase in the us was driven primarily by i increased volume and ii an increase in revenue per car due to higher average auction selling prices which we believe is due to a change in the mix of vehicles sold and partially offset by iii hurricane harvey as the storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles in the prior year the increase in volume in the us was derived from i growth in the number of units sold from new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and ii growth from existing suppliers driven by what we believe was an increase in total loss frequency excluding the detrimental impact of 120 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound brazilian real and european union euro to us dollar exchange rates the increase in international of 370 million was driven primarily by increased volume and an increase in revenue per car 

the following table presents a comparison of vehicle sales for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  



vehicle sales the increase in vehicle sales for fiscal 2019 of 591 million  or 260 as compared to fiscal 2018 came from i an increase in international of 457 million and ii an increase in the us of 134 million  excluding a detrimental impact of 89 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound and european union euro to us dollar exchange rates the growth in international of 546 million was primarily the result of higher average auction selling prices and an increase in volume the increase in the us was primarily the result of increased volume and higher average auction selling prices which we believe was due to a change in the mix of vehicles sold 

the following table presents a comparison of yard operations expense for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  



yard operations expenses the increase in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2019 of 412 million  or 49 as compared to fiscal 2018 resulted from i an increase in the us of 208 million  primarily from growth in volume and a 68 million increase in depreciation and ii an increase in international of 205 million related primarily to growth in volume partially offset by the beneficial impact of 72 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound brazilian real and european union euro to us dollar exchange rate the increase in the cost to process each car in fiscal 2018 in the us relates to the negative impact of abnormal costs of 686 million for temporary storage facilities abnormally high costs for subhaulers increased labor costs due to overtime travel and lodging due to the reassignment of employees and equipment lease expenses to handle the increased volume associated with hurricane harvey as the storm produced extraordinary volumes of flood damaged vehicles these costs did not include normal expenses associated with the increased unit volume created by the hurricane which are deferred until the sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance sheet included in yard operations expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses the increase in yard operations depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from depreciating new and expanded facilities placed into service in the us 

the following table presents a comparison of cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  



cost of vehicle sales  the increase in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2019 of 590 million  or 301 as compared to fiscal 2018 was the result of i an increase in international of 479 million and ii an increase in the us of 111 million  excluding the beneficial impact of 78 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and european euro to us dollar exchange rate the increase in international of 557 million was primarily the result of higher purchase prices and increased volume the increase in the us was primarily the result of increased volume and higher average purchase prices which we believe is due to a change in the mix of vehicles sold 

the following table presents a comparison of general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  



general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 of 50 million  or 28 as compared to fiscal 2018 came primarily from an increase in the us of 77 million  partially offset by a decrease in international of 27 million  primarily from the fiscal 2018 impact of payroll taxes from the exercise of employee stock options excluding depreciation and amortization the increase in the us of 71 million resulted primarily from supporting our continued growth initiatives as well as certain litigation costs and payroll taxes from the exercise of employee stock options 

the following table summarizes impairment total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  



  

impairment during fiscal 2018 we recognized a 11 million charge primarily related to fully impairing a supply contract in the international segment during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

other expense income the decrease in total other expense for fiscal 2019 of 103 million  or 472 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to gains on the disposal of certain nonoperating assets in the current year and an increase in currency gains primarily due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate partially offset by losses on the disposal of certain nonoperating assets in the prior year 

income taxes our effective income tax rates were 161  257  and 104 for fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the current year’s effective tax rate was computed based on the us federal statutory tax rate of 210 for the fiscal year ending july 31 2019 and was favorably impacted by 102 million of discrete tax items related to amending previously filed income tax returns the prior year’s effective tax rate was computed based on the reduced blended us federal statutory tax rate of 269 for the fiscal year ending july 31 2018 and included the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” see note 10 — income taxes for a detailed discussion of the act the effective tax rates in the current and prior years were also impacted from the result of recognizing excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options of 461 million  213 million  and 1076 million for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively 

discussion of fiscal year ended july 31 2018 compared to fiscal year ended july 31 2017 

for a discussion of fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017  please refer to part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended july 31 2018  filed with the securities and exchange commission on october 1 2018  

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  excluding additional funds available to us through our revolving loan facility 





cash and cash equivalents and working capital decreased 882 million and 267 million at july 31 2019  respectively as compared july 31 2018 primarily due to repurchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program capital expenditures and payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings partially offset by cash generated from operations and a decline in cash used for acquisitions cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits domestic certificates of deposit and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of service fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales we expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business in addition to our stock repurchase program we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash balances and our cash flows from operations these alternative potential uses include additional stock repurchases repayments of longterm debt the payment of dividends and acquisitions for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 7 — longterm debt and note 9 — stockholders’ equity and under the subheadings “ credit agreement ” and “ note purchase agreement ” below 

our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the winter months most of our facilities process 5 to 20 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months we expect to acquire or develop additional locations and expand some of our current facilities in the foreseeable future we may be required to raise additional cash through drawdowns on our revolving loan facility or issuance of additional equity to fund this expansion although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business costs to develop a new yard can range from 30 to 500 million depending on size location and developmental infrastructure requirements 

as of july 31 2019  753 million of the  1863 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us the repatriation of these funds could still be subject to the foreign withholding tax related to the us tax reform and the mandatory transition tax which is imposed on the post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not require repatriation to fund our us operations 

net cash used in operating activities increased for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to improved cash operating results from an increase in service and vehicle sales revenues and lower asset impairments partially offset by an increase in yard operations and general and administrative expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in income taxes payable of 138 million offset by a decrease in funds used to pay accounts payable of 422 million decrease in funds received on accounts receivable of 205 million and an increase in vehicle pooling costs deferred of 131 million primarily from the adoption of asc 606 as we began deferring the inbound transportation costs and titling fees directly associated with the vehicles during fiscal 2019 

net cash used in investing activities increased for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to increases in capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets and a decrease in acquisitions our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities software development and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations we have no material noncancelable commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2019  included in capital expenditures were capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software capitalized software development costs were 61 million 74 million and 71 million for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired additionally during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  

net cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to repurchases of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program as discussed in further detail under the subheading “ stock repurchases ” an increase in payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by net repayments on our revolving loan facility for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 9 — stockholders’ equity

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates include but are not limited to vehicle pooling costs income taxes stockbased compensation purchase price allocations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other judgments that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we discuss where appropriate sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item i “financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asc 606 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605 revenue recognition  asu 201409 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract asu 201409 was effective for annual and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and was effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 asu 201409 allows adoption with either retrospective application to each period presented or modified retrospective application with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application we used the modified retrospective application with the cumulative effect as our transition method 

upon adoption service revenue and vehicle sales revenue are recognized at the date the vehicles are sold at auction this timing of revenue recognition under asu 201409 is consistent with our previous policy under asc 605 for most service and vehicle sales revenue however the adoption represents a change in the timing of revenue recognition for certain service revenues such as inbound transportation and titling fees which were previously recognized under asc 605 when the services were performed which generally occurred prior to auction related costs to prepare the vehicles for auction including inbound transportation and titling are deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition this change resulted in a decrease to beginning retained earnings as of august 1 2018 of 230 million as a result of the initial application of the standard and did not have a material impact to earnings this retained earnings adjustment related to adjustments to accounts receivable vehicle pooling costs and deferred taxes upon adoption of the standard 

there were no contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at july 31 2019  our disaggregation between service revenues and vehicle sales at the segment level reflects how the nature timing amount and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are impacted by economic factors we report sales taxes on relevant transactions on a net basis in our consolidated results of operations and therefore do not include sales taxes in revenues or costs 

service revenues 

our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services within this revenue category our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees vehicle listing fees and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price tiered vehicle sales price driven fees or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility title processing and preparation fees vehicle storage fees bidding fees and vehicle loading fees these services are not distinct within the context of the contract accordingly revenue for these services is recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied at the completion of the auction process we do not take ownership of these consigned vehicles which are stored at our facilities located throughout the us and at its international locations these fees are recognized as net revenue not gross vehicle selling price at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged 

we identified a separate performance obligation related to providing access to our online auction platform we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our online auctions and access our bidding platform under the new standard this fee will continue to be recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement generally one year as each day of access to the online auction platform represents the best depiction of the transfer of the service 

no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return or warranty although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our buyers or sellers 



vehicle sales 

certain vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf we identified a single performance obligation related to the sale of these vehicles which is the completion of the online auction process under the new standard vehicle sales revenue will continue to be recognized on the auction date as we act as a principal in vehicle sales transactions the gross sales price at auction is recorded as revenue 



contract assets 

we capitalize certain contract assets related to obtaining a contract where the amortization period for the related asset is greater than one year these assets are amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship contract assets are classified as current or longterm other assets based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the related revenues and are amortized as an offset to the associated revenues on a straightline basis we assess these costs for impairment at least quarterly and as “triggering” events occur that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the contract asset costs where the amortization period for the related asset is one year or less are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of income 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer costs that relate directly to the fulfillment of our contracts associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the end of the period we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation costs of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are inbound transportation costs titling fees certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing upon the adoption of asc 606 we began deferring the inbound transportation costs and titling fees directly associated with the vehicles within our vehicle pooling costs if the allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in us gaap in accordance with asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

 

the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities and revolving loan facility approximated their fair values for fiscal 2019 and 2018 due to the shortterm nature of those instruments and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments see notes to consolidated financial statements note 7 — longterm debt and note 8 – fair value measures  

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life generally three to seven years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that impact the recoverability of these assets total gross capitalized software as of july 31 2019 and 2018 was 394 million and 307 million  respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software as of july 31 2019 and 2018 totaled 236 million and 160 million  respectively during the year ended july 31 2018 we retired fully amortized capitalized software of 155 million  which were no longer being utilized additionally during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our reporting units annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis the annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed qualitatively during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  considered all relevant factors specific to our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events management considered the above factors noting none involved significant uncertainty in addition the industry in which we operate improved over the observable period and our calculated fair value exceeded carrying value for each reporting unit by a substantial amount in our prior year quantitative analysis indicating no material risk as of july 31 2019  with respect to potential goodwill impairments 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada the uk brazil spain germany and other emerging markets around the world in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate then we analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we consider the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law as of july 31 2019  we have 86 million of valuation allowance arising from both our us and international operations to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision the repatriation of our accumulated foreign earnings could also affect our effective tax rate nevertheless we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations and do not anticipate the need for any of our foreign subsidiaries’ cash in the us operations accordingly we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 

based on our results for the year ended july 31 2019  a one percentage adverse change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase in the income tax expense of 70 million  

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc740 income taxes pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc740 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected 

ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method as required by asc 718 compensation—stock compensation asc 718 which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased awards made to employees consultants and directors based on estimated fair value asc 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of stockbased awards on the measurement date using an optionpricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized in expense over the requisite service periods asc 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

the fair value of each option was estimated on the measurement date using the blackscholes merton bsm optionpricing model utilizing subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

foreign currency translation 

we record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the us dollar reporting currency the canadian dollar british pound brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial bahraini dinar and indian rupee are the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries as they are the primary currencies within the economic environment in which each subsidiary operates the original equity investment in the respective subsidiaries is translated at historical rates assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiary’s operations are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period adjustments resulting from the translation of each subsidiary’s financial statements are reported in other comprehensive income 

accounting for acquisitions 

we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquired entities in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  the allocation of the purchase consideration for acquisitions can require extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase consideration to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill critical estimates in valuing certain identifiable assets include but are not limited to expected longterm revenues future expected operating expenses cost of capital appropriate attrition and discount rates 

segment reporting 

our us and international regions are considered two separate operating segments and are disclosed as two reportable segments the segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results including total revenues and operating income our revenues for the year ended july 31 2019 were distributed as follows us 811 and international 189  geographic information as well as comparative segment revenues and related financial information pertaining to the us and international segments for the years ended july 31 2019  2018 and 2017 are presented in the tables in note 12 — segments and other geographic reporting  to the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as of july 31 2019  as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2019  we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2019  a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement were zero as of july 31 2019  the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement bears interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050  or iii the libor rate plus 10  in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 00 to 075 based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b the libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 100 to 175 depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate if interest rates were to increase by 10 our interest expense would increase by 20 million  

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar british pound brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 79 million for fiscal 2019  

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and discussions with the european union began in march 2017 the ultimate effects of brexit on us are difficult to predict but adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2019  the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of 1325 million  this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial bahraini dinar and indian rupee would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except for the remediated material weakness discussed above there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain and spain  

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also producing environmental and social benefits for the world by promoting vehicle restoration repair and recycling parts refurbishment and reuse and facilitating the recovery and resilience of communities affected by severe climate events   

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 

we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price   

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk and germany we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles  for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured   

through our virtual bidding third generation vb3 auction platform our sales process is open to registered buyers whom we refer to as “members” anywhere in the world with access to the internet this technology and model employ a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility or over the internet during the preview period to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb3 system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb3’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe the introduction of our virtual auction platform increased the pool of available buyers for each sale which resulted in added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improved the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated with live auctions 

for fiscal 2018  sales of us vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 523 of total vehicles sold 309 of vehicles were sold to out of state members within the us and 214 were sold to international members based on the address submitted during registration 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

 

historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in the amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both members and sellers and v growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal 2018  our revenues were  18 billion  and our operating income was  5843 million

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program which we refer to as pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs under the consignment program or fixed fee program only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion companies in our industry will purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based on the vehicles’ estimated preaccident cash value and the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and delivered to the buyer while most companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction or a hybrid internet and physical auction we sell virtually all of our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  our primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

the primary buyers of vehicles at our auctions are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some states the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers based on volume of vehicles purchased either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

the majority of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident or to a lesser extent a natural disaster typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its preaccident value pav otherwise known as actual cash value acv the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the pav less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer systems advanced cameras collision warning systems and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

 

in the uk some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles under these circumstances insurance companies will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order the assignment we arrange for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold at auction on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member typically seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller

percentage incentive program  our percentage incentive program is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle sellers under pip we agree to sell all of the vehicles of a seller in a specified market usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price because our revenues under pip are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return we provide the vehicle seller at our expense with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility as well as dmv document and title processing in addition we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather washing vehicle exteriors vacuuming vehicle interiors cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires making keys for drivable vehicles and identifying drivable vehicles we believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of the vehicles thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle sellers and us

we offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles utilizing vb3 vb3 opens our sales process to members and to individuals who have not registered to view auctions via our website and our mobile application anywhere in the world where internet access is available the vb3 technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb3 system lets a member see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb3’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf during all steps of the auction preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the highest preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time and then bid4u submits bids for the highest preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown or any extensions the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

copart dealer services

upullit 

in the uk we have two facilities from which the public can purchase parts from salvaged and endoflife vehicles in general the buyer is responsible for detaching the parts from the vehicle and any associated hauling or transportation of the parts after detachment after the valuable parts have been removed by the buyer the remaining parts and car body are sold for their scrap value 

sales 

we process vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle sellers no single customer accounted for more than 10  of our revenues for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  we obtained 78 of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2018  from insurance company sellers we obtained 84 and 83 of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively from insurance company sellers 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle sellers the agreements are customized to each vehicle seller’s particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle seller in a designated geographic area 

we market our services to vehicle sellers through an inhouse sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques including targeted mailing of our sales literature telemarketing followup personal sales calls internet search engines employee referrals tow shop referrals participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions we market our services to franchise and independent dealerships as well as the general public we may when appropriate provide vehicle sellers with detailed analysis of the net return on vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses 

during the last three years a majority of our revenue was generated within the us and a majority of our longlived assets are located within the us please see note 14 — segments and other geographic reporting  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the geographic location of our sales and our longlived assets 

members 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered members in the vehicle dismantling and recycling rebuilding used vehicle dealer and export industries as well as members that are a part of the general public where applicable  we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing members with a variety of programs and services to become a registered member a person or business must complete a basic application either online or through our mobile applications before any member may purchase a vehicle they must provide copies of current government issued photo identification additionally business members must provide current business information including copies of licenses which may include vehicle dismantler dealer resale repair or export licenses and as needed completed sales tax exemption certificates registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements in certain venues we may sell to the general public either directly or members may purchase a vehicle offered at copart through a registered broker who meets local licensing and permitting requirements a member may also bring guests to a facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that will not result in a completed sale we market to members online and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing direct mail inlocation marketing search engines social media radio television trade publications and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in the us include kar auction services inc including subsidiaries adesa inc and insurance auto auctions inc auction broadcasting company llc and manheim inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation lkq lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in our international markets our principal competitors are vehicle auction and sales companies vehicle dismantlers and privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary yard management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system which runs our proprietary software developed to process salvage sales vehicles throughout the auction process this system is integrated with the internet to enable buyers to view salvage vehicles and bid on them it can also be integrated with the seller’s system and enables the sellers to monitor their vehicles and analyze the progression of vehicles through the auction process our auctionstyle service product vb3 is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required 

we have invested in production data centers that are designed to continuously operate to support the business even in the event of an emergency the data centers’ electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored the data centers are located in areas generally considered to be free of frequent weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes we operate fully redundant infrastructure to ensure ongoing operations even in the event of physical damage to one of our data centers 

we have developed a proprietary system to enable us to address our international expansion needs this proprietary system is designed to provide multilanguage and multicurrency capabilities we began using our new internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 we intend to continue development of this system and implement it in certain additional international locations in the future 

employees 

as of july 31 2018  we had 6026  fulltime employees of whom 1023 were engaged in general and administrative functions and 5003 were engaged in yard operations we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good employees per geographic region are as follows 



environmental matters 

our operations are subject to federal national international provincial state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and foreign motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in 2008 we obtained a patent issued by the united states patent and trademark office that covers certain aspects of our virtual bidding auction platform generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with certain of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

no single customer accounted for more than 10  of our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2018  historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected revenues in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside the us including expansions in europe brazil and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired or operational capabilities established outside the us could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside the us in fiscal 2003 with an acquisition in canada subsequently in fiscal 2008 we made a significant acquisition in the uk followed by acquisitions in the uae brazil germany and spain in fiscal 2013 expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015 expansion into the republic of ireland and india in fiscal 2016 and an acquisition in finland in fiscal 2018 in addition we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside of the us acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside of the us pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards and operations acquiring buyers and sellers and implementing shared services capabilities in international markets among other things we plan to ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally for example although we continue to operate a technology and operations center in india for administrative support we recently decided to suspend our salvage operations in india which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position until the indian market develops in a manner better suited to our business model 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results moreover success in opening and operating facilities in markets can be dependent upon establishing new relationships with buyers and sellers and our failure to establish those relationships could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 



 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and discussions with the european union began in march 2017 the ultimate effects of brexit on us are difficult to predict but adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently   

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the competition and markets authority uk regulator if an inquiry is made by the uk regulator we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulator will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the uk regulator determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulator the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in some cases the enforcement practices of governmental regulators in certain foreign areas and the procedural and substantive rights and remedies available to us may vary significantly from those in the united states which could have an adverse effect on our business 

although we face risks associated with international expansion in each of the nonus markets where we operate our current focus on the german market heightens the risks we face relating to our expansion plans in germany 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not until our acquisition been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing 

economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa uk bribery act brazil clean companies act india’s prevention of corruption act 1988 or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the us market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in the us 

some of our target markets outside the us operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in the us for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in the us in which we generally act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in the us canada and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets including germany insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside the us canada and the uk including germany in particular we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

acquisitions typically will increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions to date most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

we have developed a new proprietary enterprise operating system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we continue to design and develop this system 

we have developed a new proprietary enterprise operating system to address our international expansion needs the ongoing design development and implementation of our enterprise operating systems carry certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the transition to our new internally developed proprietary system will require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance that the volume of business will increase we began using our new internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 

we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due to 

among other things slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the impairment of internally developed capitalized software costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position for example during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

disruptions to our information technology systems including failure to prevent outages maintain security prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems and other confidential information could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

information availability and security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of in addition to other factors the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees in addition human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to information technology system disruptions andor cyberattacks including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system phishing attacks or other information technology data security incidents 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control 

information technology system disruptions cyberattacks or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation operating results or financial condition by among other things making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time damaging our reputation with buyers sellers and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including account data information or resulting in governmental investigations litigation liability fines or penalties against us if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of these cyber risks our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation 

we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions these attempts have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business for example in april 2015 we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to data provided to us by our members that is considered to be personal information in certain jurisdictions we immediately investigated including the engagement of an external expert security firm and made the required notifications to members whose information may have been accessed and to regulatory agencies 

we are constantly evaluating and implementing new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyberattacks and system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes we have further enhanced our security protocols based on the investigation we conducted in response to the security incident nevertheless we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address prior data security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future data security incidents or system failures will be successful the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyberattacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future if our systems are compromised again in the future become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate 

and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet and other points of access while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and other obligations regarding privacy and data protection 

we are subject to federal state and international laws directives and regulations relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personal data these laws directives and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction recent regulatory changes in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from europe to the united states for example the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which went into effect in the european union “eu” on may 25 2018 applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu and may also apply to related products and services that we offer to eu users complying with the gdpr and similar emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices noncompliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties legal proceedings by governmental entities or others and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to retain and attract customers any of the risks described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in the us canada and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

we implemented our online system across all of our us canada and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in those markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in the us canada and the uk however we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita sandy and harvey had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the united states we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2016 we opened new operational facilities in castledermot republic of ireland algete spain madrid and six new operational facilities in the us in fiscal 2017 we opened a new operational facility in bad fallingbostel germany hanover a new operational facility in betim minas gerais brazil nine new operational facilities in the us and acquired cycle express llc which conducts business primarily as national powersport auctions npa a leading nonsalvage auction platform for motorcycles snowmobiles watercraft and other powersports vehicles npa currently operates facilities in atlanta georgia cincinnati ohio dallas texas philadelphia pennsylvania and san diego california in fiscal 2018 we opened new operational facilities in andrews texas midland exeter rhode island and lumberton north carolina a new operational facility in belfast northern ireland a new operational facility in nobitz germany leipzig and acquired locations in the municipalities of espoo pirkkala oulu and turku finland acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

 

in addition certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

 

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 



 

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely primarily upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure accidents and related injury claims availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to our different lines of insurance coverage including without limitation medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability  our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate 159 of our common stock as of july 31 2018  if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman or a jayson adair our chief executive officer or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

cash investments are subject to risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public will involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2006 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2018 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricanes katrina rita sandy and harvey weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory  and included premiums for subhaulers payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices declines in used car prices and vehiclerelated technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates whether due to among other things a reduction in miles driven per car vehiclerelated technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and to the extent widely adopted the advent of autonomous vehicles could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts which we refer to as pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our 

facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage and other vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk and other foreign markets the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

government regulation of the vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including but not limited to those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use and antimoney laundering failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws or the interpretation of laws including foreign laws and regulations affecting the import and export of vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base as a result our foreign buyers may be subject to a variety of foreign laws and regulations including the imposition of import duties by foreign countries changes in laws regulations and treaties that restrict or impede or negatively affect the economics surrounding the importation of vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base in addition we and our vehicle buyers must work with foreign customs agencies and other nonus governmental officials who are responsible for the interpretation application and enforcement of these laws regulations and treaties any inability to obtain requisite approvals or agreements from such authorities could adversely impact the ability of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries in addition any disputes or disagreements with foreign agencies or officials over import duties tariffs or similar matters including disagreements over the value assigned to imported vehicles could adversely affect our costs and the ability and costs of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad changes in the 

interpretation application and enforcement of laws regulations or treaties any failure to comply with nonus laws or regulatory interpretations or any legal or regulatory interpretations or governmental actions that significantly increase our costs or the costs of our buyers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services and our ability to compete in nonus markets 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national international provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations as of july 31 2018  the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was  3372 million  

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made the annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed qualitatively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  considered all relevant factors specific to our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events  changes in these factors or changes in actual performance could affect the fair value of goodwill which may result in an impairment charge for example deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets we considered the above factors noting none involved significant uncertainty in addition the industry in which we operate improved over the observable period and our calculated fair value exceeded carrying value for each reporting unit by a substantial amount in our previous quantitative analysis indicating no material risk as of july 31 2018  with respect to potential goodwill impairments should the value of our goodwill become impaired it could 

have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

changes in federal state and local or foreign tax laws changing interpretations of existing tax laws or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state provincial and local levels in the united states the united kingdom and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate including income taxes sales taxes valueadded vat taxes and similar taxes and assessments the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe our tax positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united states hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom state tax authorities in the states in which we operate and other similar tax authorities in international jurisdictions as previously disclosed we have been subject to challenge by the georgia department of revenue with respect to sales taxes and could face similar audits or challenges from applicable federal state or foreign tax authorities in the future while we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes interest and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities 

new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” or “tax act” was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act significantly revamped us taxation of corporations including a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 a repeal of the exceptions to the 10 million deduction limitation for performancebased compensation to covered employees and a new tax regime for foreign earnings the repeal of the 10 million deduction limit for performancebased compensation the new us taxes on accumulated and future foreign earnings and other adverse changes resulting from the tax act or a change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings might offset the benefit from the reduced tax rate and our future effective tax rates andor cash taxes may increase even significantly or not decrease much compared to recent or historical trends many of the provisions of the tax act are highly complex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the irs or others some of the provisions of the tax act may be changed by a future congress or challenged by the world trade organization “wto” although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance or actions by a future congress or wto they could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position income tax expense on accumulated foreign earnings recorded as a result of the tax act is a provisional amount and reflects our current best estimate which may be adjusted over the course of the next year and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and discussions with the european union began in march 2017 adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future

 item 3 legal proceedings 

legal proceedings 

we are subject to threats of litigation and are involved in actual litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage contract disputes and handling or disposal of vehicles the material pending legal proceedings to which we are party or of which our property is subject include the following matters 

on november 1 2013 we filed suit against sparta consulting inc now known as kpit the suit arose out of our september 17 2013 decision to terminate the implementation services agreement under which kpit was to design implement and deliver a customized replacement enterprise resource planning system for us on january 8 2014 kpit filed suit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of california alleging breach of contract promissory estoppel breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing account stated quantum meruit unjust enrichment and declaratory relief on june 8 2016 we amended our complaint to include claims that kpit stole certain intellectual property owned by us and acted negligently in its provision of services the case was tried in april and may 2018 on may 22 2018  the jury returned a verdict for us on our fraud claim against kpit for 47 million  and on our professional negligence claim against kpit for 163 million  and the jury found for kpit on its implied covenant counterclaim against us for 49 million  

in a september 10 2018  posttrial order the court reduced our professional negligence award to 91 million  found kpit liable under california’s unfair competition law ucl for fraudulent and unfair conduct and held that we could recover restitution of 63 million  if the we choose to forego our fraud and professional negligence damages found that we were not entitled to restitution on our unjust enrichment claim and awarded kpit prejudgment interest on its implied covenant counterclaim starting from december 26 2016 further posttrial proceedings are expected in this lawsuit including the determination of our right to prejudgment interest on our successful claims 

we have provided for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when the insurance is purchased 

governmental proceedings 

the georgia department of revenue or dor conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of their initial audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to collect and remit sales taxes totaling 738 million  including penalties and interest 

subsequently we engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of proposed assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel provided us with an opinion that the sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply following our receipt of the notice of proposed assessment we and our counsel engaged in active discussions with the dor to resolve the matter 

during an extended remand period it was determined that grounds exist for a substantial reduction in the official assessment on the basis that i the transactions and resulting tax at issue were erroneously doublecounted by the dor in the audit sales transaction work papers on which the assessment was based and ii we were ultimately able to provide documentation showing that most of the remaining transactions were sales at wholesale therefore qualifying for the sale for resale exemption from georgia sales and use tax after these reductions the remaining amount of principal georgia sales and use tax still in dispute between the parties is 26 million  plus applicable interest a consent order to this effect was entered by the georgia tax tribunal on may 22 2017  since the date of entry of the consent order the dor filed a motion for summary judgment related to the remaining 26 million  in dispute we opposed the dor’s motion and are awaiting a decision by the court regarding the dor’s motion 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm advice from our outside tax advisors and our best estimate of a probable outcome we believe that we have adequately provided for the payment of any assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the remaining tax liability set forth above and intend to continue to defend this matter there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the dor we understand that litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain and spain  

our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders while also producing environmental and social benefits for the world by promoting vehicle restoration repair and recycling parts refurbishment and reuse and facilitating the recovery and resilience of communities affected by severe climate events 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us canada brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle buyers “members” and vehicle sellers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk and germany we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles  for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value andor to facilitate a sale for the insured 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue  our revenue consists of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenue and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where our fees are fixed based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program which we refer to as pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs not included in the consignment fee under the consignment program only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk we have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by several factors including total loss frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price as a significant amount of our service revenue is associated in some manner with the ultimate selling price of the vehicle vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by i changes in commodity prices particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies as we believe this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii used car pricing which we also believe has an impact on total loss frequency iii the mix of cars sold and iv changes in the us dollar exchange rate to foreign currencies which we believe has an impact on auction participation by international buyers we cannot specifically quantify the financial impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles our service revenues or financial results total loss frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repairs costs used car values and auction returns over the last several years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in total loss frequency the increase in total loss frequency may have been driven by the decline in used car values relative to repair costs which we believe are generally trending upward conversely increases in used car prices such as occurred during the most recent recession may decrease total loss frequency and adversely affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road the average age of cars on the road continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 121 years in 2018 the factors that can influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in total loss frequency 

operating costs and expenses  yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

other income and expense  other income primarily includes income from the rental of certain real property foreign exchange rate gains and losses and gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period other expense consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

liquidity and cash flows  our primary source of working capital is cash operating results and debt financing the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and revolving loan facility the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v total loss frequency vi increased volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix xi contract mix to the extent applicable and xii our capital expenditures these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of shares through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of additional debt with new lenders and equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future or on commercially acceptable terms 

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in the us canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain with the intention of providing national coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following table sets forth operational facilities that we have acquired or opened and began operations from august 1 2015 through july 31 2018  



 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it has been our practice and remains our intention where possible to migrate these 

types of contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

yard operations expenses  the increase  in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2018  of 1685 million  or 248  as compared to fiscal 2017  resulted from i an increase  in the us of 1453 million  primarily from growth in volume a marginal increase in the cost to process each car and a 155 million  increase in depreciation and ii an increase  in international of 232 million  related primarily to growth in volume partially offset by the detrimental impact of 58 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and european union euro to us dollar exchange rate the increase in the cost to process each car in the us was negatively impacted by abnormal costs of 686 million  for temporary storage facilities premiums for subhaulers labor costs incurred from overtime travel and lodging due to the reassignment of employees to the affected region and equipment lease expenses to handle the increased volume associated with hurricane harvey as the storm produced extraordinary volumes of flood damaged vehicles these costs do not include normal expenses associated with the increased unit volume created by the hurricane which are deferred until the sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance sheet included in yard operations expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses the increase in yard operations depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from depreciating new and expanded facilities and certain technology assets placed into service in the us and international locations as well as changes to the useful lives of certain fixed assets 

the increase in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2017  of 955 million  or 164  as compared to fiscal 2016  resulted from i an increase in the us of 914 million  primarily from growth in volume and a marginal increase in the cost to process each car and ii an increase in international of 41 million  related primarily to growth in volume partially offset by the beneficial impact of 91 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate included in yard operations expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses the increase in yard operations depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from depreciating new and expanded facilities and certain technology assets placed into service in the us

acquisitions and higher average purchase prices which we believe is due to higher commodity prices and a change in the mix of vehicles sold 

the decrease in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2017  of 34 million  or 24  as compared to fiscal 2016  was the result of i a decrease in international of 90 million  partially offset by and ii an increase in the us of 56 million  excluding the beneficial impact of 104 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate the increase in international of 14 million was primarily the result of increased volume the increase in the us was primarily the result of higher average purchase prices which we believe is due to higher commodity prices and a change in the mix of vehicles sold partially offset by a shift in volume for certain sellers from principal to agency business

the following table summarizes impairment total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  



  

impairment  during fiscal 2018 we recognized a 11 million  charge primarily related to fully impairing a supply contract in the international segment during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million  charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

other expense income  the increase  in total other expense for fiscal 2018  of 06 million  or 30  as compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to a decrease in currency gains in international primarily due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate and to a decrease in interest expense of 34 million as a result of the paydown of our revolving loan facility 

the increase in total other expense for fiscal 2017  of 106 million  or 999  as compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to a decrease in currency gains in international primarily due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate and a change in the mix of currencies held in cash and cash equivalents 

income taxes  our effective income tax rates were 257  104  and 317  for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the tax rates in the prior year were impacted primarily from the result of recognizing excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options of 213 million  and 1076 million  for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  respectively the current year’s effective tax rate was computed based on the reduced blended us federal corporate tax rate of 269  for the fiscal year ending july 31 2018  and included the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” or “tax act” see note 12 — income taxes   for a detailed discussion of the tax act 

during the year ended july 31 2016 we adopted asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which impacted the accounting for sharebased payments including income tax consequences as a result of the adoption we recognized excess tax benefits of 147 million  as a reduction to tax expense in the consolidated statements of income as though asu 201609 had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal 2016 instead of reflected in stockholders’ equity the decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily the result of recognizing excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options of 1076 million  in fiscal 2017 as compared to 147 million in fiscal 2016  and the geographical allocation of our taxable income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  excluding additional funds available to us through our revolving loan facility 





cash and cash equivalents and working capital increased at july 31 2018  as compared july 31 2017  primarily due to cash generated from operations and a decrease in payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings and proceeds from the 

exercise of stock options partially offset by a net repayments on our revolving loan facility and a decline in cash used for acquisitions cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits domestic certificates of deposit and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates cash and cash equivalents decreased at july 31 2017  as compared to july 31 2016  primarily due to repurchases of common stock as part of our tender offer and stock repurchase program capital expenditures and payments on longterm debt partially offset by cash generated from operations and proceeds from our revolving loan facility working capital increased at july 31 2017  as compared to july 31 2016  primarily due to cash generated from operations and proceeds from our revolving loan facility partially offset by repurchases of common stock as part of our tender offer and stock repurchase program capital expenditures payments on longterm debt and changes in operating assets 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees members’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales we expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business in addition to our stock repurchase program we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash balances and our cash flows from operations these alternative potential uses include additional stock repurchases repayments of longterm debt the payment of dividends and acquisitions for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt   and  note 11 — stockholders’ equity   and under the subheadings “ credit agreement ” and “ note purchase agreement ” below 

our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months we expect to acquire or develop additional locations and expand some of our current facilities in the foreseeable future we may be required to raise additional cash through drawdowns on our revolving loan facility or issuance of additional equity to fund this expansion although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business costs to develop a new yard can range from 30 to 500 million depending on size location and developmental infrastructure requirements 

as of july 31 2018  1155 million  of the  2745 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us the repatriation of these funds could still be subject to the foreign withholding tax related to the us tax reform and the mandatory transition tax which is imposed on the post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not require repatriation to fund our us operations 

net cash used in operating activities increased  for fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  due to improved cash operating results from an increase in service revenues and lower asset impairments partially offset by an increase in yard operations and general and administrative expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable of 491 million partially offset by a decrease in income taxes receivable of 213 million and a decrease in inventory and vehicle pooling costs of 67 million 

net cash used in operating activities increased for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  due to improved cash operating results from an increase in service revenues partially offset by an increase in yard operations and general and administrative expenses an impairment of previously capitalized software development assets and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable of 441 million an increase in income taxes receivable of 250 million an increase in accounts receivable of 157 million and a decrease in other assets of 31 million 

net cash used in investing activities decreased  for fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  due primarily to a decline in acquisitions and proceeds from the sale of assets including the majorityowned subsidiary partially offset by increases in capital expenditures we acquired autovahinkokeskus oy avk a salvage auto auction company based in finland avk currently operates facilities in the municipalities of espoo pirkkala oulu and turku finland see notes to consolidated financial statements  note 2 — acquisitions  our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain

net cash used in financing activities increased  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due net repayments on our revolving loan facility partially offset by reduced payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 11 — stockholders’ equity  

net cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock as part of our tender offers and stock repurchase program as discussed in further detail under the subheading “ stock repurchases ” and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 11 — stockholders’ equity

the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement bears interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050  or iii an adjusted libor rate determined on the basis of a onemonth interest period plus 10  in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 00  to 075  based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 100  to 175  depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate the interest rate as of july 31 2018  on our revolving loan facility was the one month libor rate of 209  plus an applicable margin of 100  the carrying amount of the credit agreement is comprised of borrowings under which interest accrues under a fluctuating interest rate structure accordingly the carrying value approximates fair value at july 31 2018  and was classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy 

amounts borrowed under the revolving loan facility may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date of july 21 2021  we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility the commitment fee rate ranges from 0125  to 020  depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment under the credit agreement we had no  outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan facility as of july 31 2018  we had 2310 million  of outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan facility as of july 31 2017

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2018  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements pursuant to item 303a4 of regulation sk promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including costs related to vehicle pooling selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition stockbased payment compensation purchase price allocations longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we discuss where appropriate sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item i “financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current contracts collecting the proceeds from the member presale services including towing title processing preparation and storage as well as sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service net of applicable rebates or allowances for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle the revenue associated with the presale services is recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and determinable the selling price of each service is determined based on management’s best estimate and is allotted based on the relative selling price method 

vehicle sales where vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf are recognized on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legally binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multipleelement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting 

the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605 revenue recognition  asu 201409 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract asu 201409 is effective for annual and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and will be effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 asu 201409 allows adoption with either retrospective application to each period presented or modified retrospective application with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application we will use the modified retrospective application with the cumulative effect as its transition method 

upon adoption service revenue revenue from buyers and sellers and vehicle sales revenue will generally be recognized at the date the vehicles are sold at auction this timing of revenue recognition under asu 201409 is consistent with our current policy under asc 605 for buyer and vehicle sales revenue however the adoption represents a change in the timing of revenue recognition for certain seller revenues such as inbound tow and titling fees which are currently recognized under asc 605 when the services are performed related costs to prepare the vehicles for auction including inbound tow and titling will be deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition we have evaluated the impact the adoption will have on the consolidated financial statements and we are finalizing the calculation of our cumulative effect adjustment this change will result in a decrease to beginning retained earnings as of august 1 2018 within a range of 100 million  to 150 million  as a result of the initial application of the standard and will not have a material impact to earnings 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in us gaap in accordance with asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

   

the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values for fiscal 2018  and 2017  due to the shortterm nature of those instruments and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  for additional fair value disclosures 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation for an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “abnormal” as provided in the guidance in addition the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life generally three years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets total gross capitalized software as of july 31 2018  and 2017  was 307 million  and 385 million  respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software as of july 31 2018  and 2017  totaled 160 million  and 257 million  respectively during the year ended july 31 2016 we retired fully amortized capitalized software of 298 million  which were no longer being utilized additionally during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million  charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our reporting units annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis we have historically evaluated goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fourth quarter or when an indicator of impairment exists during the year ended july 31 2017 we voluntarily changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment for our reporting units from the end of fiscal fourth quarter july 31 to the beginning of fiscal fourth quarter may 1 this voluntary change in the annual goodwill assessment date is a change in accounting principle which we believe is preferable as it more closely aligns the timing of the annual goodwill impairment assessment date with the most current information from our planning and forecasting process and also provides us with additional time to complete the annual assessment in advance of our yearend reporting this change in the annual assessment date does not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge this change was not applied retrospectively as it was impracticable to do so because retrospective application would require application of significant estimates and assumptions with the use of hindsight accordingly the change has been applied prospectively 

the annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed qualitatively during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  considered all relevant factors specific to our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events  management considered the above factors noting none involved significant uncertainty in addition the industry in which we operate improved over the observable period and our calculated fair value exceeded carrying value for each reporting unit by a substantial amount in our prior year quantitative analysis indicating no material risk as of july 31 2018  with respect to potential goodwill impairments 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada the uk brazil spain germany and other emerging markets around the world in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate then we analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from 

deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2018  we have 46 million  of valuation allowance arising from both our us and international operations to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision the repatriation of our accumulated foreign earnings could also affect our effective tax rate nevertheless we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations and do not anticipate the need for any of our foreign subsidiaries’ cash in the us operations accordingly we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 

based on our results for the year ended july 31 2018  a one percentage adverse change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase in the income tax expense of 56 million  

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc740 income taxes pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc740 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

stockbased payment compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method compensation cost related to stockbased payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes merton option pricing model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position during the year ended july 31 2016 we adopted asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which impacted the accounting for sharebased payments including income tax consequences as a result of the adoption we recognized excess tax benefits of 147 million  as a reduction to tax expense in the consolidated statements of income as though asu 201609 had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal 2016 instead of reflected in stockholders’ equity 

foreign currency translation 

we record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the us dollar reporting currency the canadian dollar british pound brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial bahraini dinar and indian rupee are the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries as they are the primary currencies within the economic environment in which each subsidiary operates the original equity investment in the respective subsidiaries is translated at historical rates assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiary’s operations are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period adjustments resulting from the translation of each subsidiary’s financial statements are reported in other comprehensive income 

accounting for acquisitions 

we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquired entities in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  the allocation of the purchase consideration for acquisitions can require extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase consideration to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill critical estimates in valuing certain identifiable assets include but are not limited to expected longterm revenues future expected operating expenses cost of capital appropriate attrition and discount rates 

segment reporting 

our us and international regions are considered two  separate operating segments and are disclosed as two  reportable segments the segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results including total revenues operating income and income before income taxes the segments continue to share similar business models services and economic characteristics our revenues for the year ended july 31 2018 were distributed as follows us 826  and international 174  geographic information as well as comparative segment revenues and related financial information pertaining to the us and international segments for the years ended july 31 2018  2017  and 2016 are presented in the tables in note 14 — segments and other geographic reporting  to the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as of july 31 2018  as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2018  we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2018  a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement were zero  as of july 31 2018  the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement bears interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050  or iii an adjusted libor rate determined on the basis of a onemonth interest period plus 10  in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 00  to 075  based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 100  to 175  depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate if interest rates were to increase by 10 our interest expense would increase by 20 million  

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk brazil the republic of ireland germany finland the uae oman bahrain and spain these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar british pound brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial and bahraini dinar would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 76 million for fiscal 2018  

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and discussions with the european union began in march 2017 the ultimate effects of brexit on us are difficult to predict but adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2018  the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss  of 1079 million  this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound brazilian real european union euro uae dirham omani rial bahraini dinar and indian rupee would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk the republic of ireland brazil germany the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain india and spain  

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us canada the republic of ireland brazil the uae oman bahrain india and spain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

we converted all of our us and canada sales to our virtual bidding second generation vb 2  during fiscal 2004 and we converted our uk sales to vb 2  during fiscal 2008 vb 2  opened our sales process to registered buyers whom we refer to as “members” anywhere in the world with access to the internet this technology and model employ a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility or over the internet during the preview period to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2  system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 ’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe the implementation of vb 2  increased the pool of available buyers for each sale which resulted in added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improved the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated with live auctions in august 2013 we launched our virtual bidding third generation vb3 an internet auctionstyle sales technology that was built on vb 2  vb3 adds several enhancements which focuses on expanding auction attendance and increasing bidding volume to attract new members and grow our membership base vb3 allows nonregistered members to view auctions via our website and our mobile applications in addition vb3 includes a completely redesigned auction interface enabling members to fit multiple auction windows on their screen while simultaneously viewing more vehicle photos and information at the time of live internet bidding

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion companies in our industry will purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based on the vehicles’ estimated preaccident cash value and the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and delivered to the buyer while most companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction or a hybrid internet and physical auction we sell virtually all of our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  our primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

the primary buyers of vehicles at our auctions are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some states the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers based on volume of vehicles purchased either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

the majority of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its preaccident value pav otherwise known as actual cash value acv the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the preaccident value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer systems advanced cameras collision warning systems and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are costlier to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

 

in the uk some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles under these circumstances insurance companies will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order the assignment we arrange for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold at auction on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller

we maintain a database of thousands of registered members in the vehicle dismantling and recycling rebuilding used vehicle dealer and export industries we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing members with a variety of programs and services to become a registered member a person or business must complete a basic application either online or through our mobile applications before any member may purchase a vehicle they must provide copies of current government issued photo identification additionally business members must provide current business information including copies of licenses which may include vehicle dismantler dealer resale repair or export licenses and as needed completed sales tax exemption certificates registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements in certain venues we may sell to the general public either directly or members may transact business at any of our sales via a registered broker who meets local licensing and permitting requirements a member may also bring guests to a facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that will not result in a completed sale we market to members online and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing direct mail inlocation marketing search engines social media radio television trade publications and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in the us include kar auction services inc including subsidiaries adesa inc and insurance auto auctions inc auction broadcasting company llc and manheim inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation lkq lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in our international markets our principal competitors are vehicle auction and sales companies vehicle dismantlers and privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary yard management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system which runs our proprietary software developed to process salvage sales vehicles throughout the auction process this system is integrated with the internet to enable buyers to view salvage vehicles and bid on them it can also be integrated with the seller’s system and enables the sellers to monitor their vehicles and analyze the progression of vehicles through the auction process our auctionstyle service product vb3 is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required 

we have invested in production data centers that are designed to continuously operate to support the business even in the event of an emergency the data centers’ electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored the data centers are located in areas generally considered to be free of frequent weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes we operate fully redundant infrastructure to ensure ongoing operations even in the event of physical damage to one of our data centers 

we have developed a proprietary system to enable us to address our international expansion needs this proprietary system is designed to provide multilanguage and multicurrency capabilities we began using our new internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain and india in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 we intend to continue development of this system and implement it in certain additional international locations in the future 

employees 

as of july 31 2017  we had 5323  fulltime employees of whom 819 were engaged in general and administrative functions and 4504 were engaged in yard operations we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good employees per geographic region are as follows 



environmental matters 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and foreign motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in june 2003 we filed a provisional us patent application on vb 2  in the united states this provisional patent application was followed by a us utility application filed in july 2003 the patent was issued by the united states patent and trademark office on january 1 2008 generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

no single customer accounted for more than 10  of our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2017  historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues seller arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected revenues in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside the us including expansions in europe brazil the middle east and india expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired outside the us into our operations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside the us in fiscal 2003 with an acquisition in canada subsequently in fiscal 2008 we made a significant acquisition in the uk followed by acquisitions in the uae brazil germany and spain in fiscal 2013 expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015 and expansion into the republic of ireland and india in fiscal 2016 in addition we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside of the us acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside of the us pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in international markets among other things we plan to ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 



 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and discussions with the european union began in march 2017 the ultimate effects of brexit on us are difficult to predict but adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future the ultimate effects of brexit on us will also depend on the terms of agreements if any that the uk and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the competition and markets authority uk regulator if an inquiry is made by the uk regulator we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulator will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the uk regulator determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulator the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in some cases the enforcement practices of governmental regulators in certain foreign areas and the procedural and substantive rights and remedies available to us may vary significantly from those in the united states which could have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not until our acquisition been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa uk bribery act brazil clean companies act india’s prevention of corruption act 1988 or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the us market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in the us 

some of our target markets outside the us operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in the us for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in the us in which we generally act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in the us canada and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside the us canada and the uk we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

acquisitions typically will increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions to date most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

we have transitioned various functionality of our previously planned thirdparty enterprise operating system to an internally developed proprietary system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we work to develop and design this system 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and internally developed a proprietary solution in its place the ongoing design development and implementation of our enterprise operating systems carry certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the transition to our new internally developed proprietary system will require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance that the volume of business will increase we began using our new internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain and india in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017 

we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due to among other things slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the impairment of capitalized development costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position for example during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

any failure to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

information security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of in addition to other factors the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees in addition human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to cyberattacks including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system phishing attacks or other information technology data security incidents 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control 

cyberattacks or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation operating results or financial condition by among other things making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time damaging our reputation with buyers sellers and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including account data information or resulting in governmental investigations litigation liability fines or penalties against us if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of these cyber risks our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation 

we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions these attempts have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business for example in april 2015 we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to data provided to us by our members that is considered to be personal information in certain jurisdictions we immediately investigated including the engagement of an external expert security firm and made the required notifications to members whose information may have been accessed and to regulatory agencies 

we are constantly evaluating and implementing new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyberattacks and system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes we have further enhanced our security protocols based on the investigation we conducted in response to the security incident nevertheless we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address prior data security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future data security incidents or system failures will be successful the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyberattacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future if our systems are compromised again in the future become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet and other points of access while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and other obligations regarding privacy and data protection 

we are subject to federal state and international laws directives and regulations relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personal data these laws directives and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices for example in october 2015 a european court decision invalidated the useu safe harbor framework which allowed us and other companies to meet certain european legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the european economic area to the us we may find it necessary or desirable to modify our data handling practices as a result of this court decision and it may serve as a basis for our personal data handling practices to be challenged or otherwise adversely impact our business noncompliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties legal proceedings by governmental entities or others and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to retain and attract customers any of the risks described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in the us canada and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

we implemented our online system across all of our us canada and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in those markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in the us canada and the uk however we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita and sandy had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the united states we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2015 we opened new facilities in bahrain oman and moncton canada in fiscal 2016 we opened new facilities in castledermot republic of ireland sonepat india algete spain and six new facilities in the us in fiscal 2017 we opened a new facility in bad fallingbostel germany a new facility in betim minas gerais brazil nine new facilities in the us and acquired cycle express llc which conducts business primarily as national powersport auctions npa a leading nonsalvage auction platform for motorcycles snowmobiles watercraft and other powersports vehicles npa currently operates facilities in atlanta georgia cincinnati ohio dallas texas philadelphia pennsylvania and san diego california acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

 

in addition certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 



 

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

 

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely primarily upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in the us canada brazil uae oman bahrain germany the republic of ireland india and spain we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate 159 of our common stock as of july 31 2017  if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer and vincent w mitz our president or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

cash investments are subject to risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public will involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2013 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricanes katrina rita and sandy weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory  and included the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices declines in used car prices and vehiclerelated technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates whether due to among other things a reduction in miles driven per car vehiclerelated technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and to the extent widely adopted the advent of autonomous vehicles could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts which we refer to as pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including but not limited to those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws or the interpretation of laws including foreign laws and regulations affecting the import and export of vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base as a result our foreign buyers may be subject to a variety of foreign laws and regulations including the imposition of import duties by foreign countries changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base in addition we and our vehicle buyers must work with foreign customs agencies and other nonus governmental officials who are responsible for the interpretation of these laws any inability to obtain requisite approvals or agreements from such authorities could adversely impact the ability of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries in addition any disputes or disagreements with foreign agencies or officials over import duties or similar matters including disagreements over the value assigned to imported vehicles could adversely affect our costs and the ability and costs of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad any failure to comply with nonus laws or regulatory interpretations or any legal or regulatory interpretations that significantly increase our costs or the costs of our buyers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services and our ability to compete in nonus markets 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in some cases we may acquire land with existing environmental issues including landfills as an example in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws 

and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations as of july 31 2017  the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was  3402 million  

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made the annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed qualitatively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  considered all relevant factors specific to our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events  changes in these factors or changes in actual performance could affect the fair value of goodwill which may result in an impairment charge for example deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets we considered the above factors noting none involved significant uncertainty in addition the industry in which we operate improved over the observable period and our calculated fair value exceeded carrying value for each reporting unit by a substantial amount in our prior year quantitative analysis indicating no material risk as of july 31 2017  with respect to potential goodwill impairments should the value of our goodwill become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

changes in federal state and local or foreign tax laws changing interpretations of existing tax laws or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state provincial and local levels in the united states the united kingdom and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate including income taxes sales taxes valueadded vat taxes and similar taxes and assessments the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although we believe our tax positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united states hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom state tax authorities in the states in which we operate and other similar tax authorities in international jurisdictions as previously disclosed we have been subject to challenge by the georgia department of revenue with respect to sales taxes and could face similar audits or challenges from applicable federal state or foreign tax authorities in the future while we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes interest and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities 

new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by among other things changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real indian rupee chinese renminbi and european union euro could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in february 2017 the british parliament voted in favor of allowing the british government to begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and discussions with the european union began in march 2017 adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future

 item 3 legal proceedings 

legal proceedings 

we are subject to threats of litigation and are involved in actual litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage contract disputes and handling or disposal of vehicles the material pending legal proceedings to which we are party or of which our property is subject include the following matters 

on november 1 2013 we filed suit against sparta consulting inc now known as kpit in the 44th judicial district court of dallas county texas alleging fraud fraudulent inducement andor promissory fraud negligent misrepresentation unfair business practices pursuant to california business and professions code § 17200 breach of contract declaratory judgment and attorney’s fees we seek compensatory and exemplary damages disgorgement of amounts paid attorney’s fees pre and postjudgment interest costs of suit and a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights duties and obligations under the implementation services agreement dated october 6 2011 the suit arises out of our september 17 2013 decision to terminate the implementation services agreement under which kpit was to design implement and deliver a customized replacement enterprise resource planning system for us on january 2 2014 kpit removed this suit to the united states district court for the northern district of texas on august 11 2014 the northern district of texas transferred the suit to the united states district court for the eastern district of california for convenience on january 8 2014 kpit filed suit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of california alleging breach of contract promissory estoppel breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing account stated quantum meruit unjust enrichment and declaratory relief kpit seeks compensatory and exemplary damages prejudgment interest costs of suit and a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights duties and obligations under the implementation services agreement on june 8 2016 we amended our complaint to include claims that kpit stole certain intellectual property owned by us and acted negligently in its provision of services we are pursuing our claim for damages and defending against kpit’s claim for damages we and kpit filed competing motions for summary judgment in january 2017 the court issued its ruling on the motions on september 25 2017 the order granted some of the relief sought by us and some of the relief sought by kpit our core claims remain in the case after the ruling including our claims for fraud fraudulent inducement breach of contract professional negligence trade secret misappropriation unfair competition unjust enrichment and computer hacking kpit’s claims are now limited to breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory relief 

we have provided for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when the insurance is purchased 

governmental proceedings 

the georgia department of revenue or dor conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of their initial audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to collect and remit sales taxes totaling 738 million  including penalties and interest 

subsequently we engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of proposed assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel provided us with an opinion that the sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply following our receipt of the notice of proposed assessment we and our counsel engaged in active discussions with the dor to resolve the matter 

on august 4 2015  the dor issued an official assessment and demand for payment the “assessment” for 961 million  for sales taxes penalties and interest that the dor alleged we owe to the state of georgia we filed an appeal of this assessment from the dor with the georgia tax tribunal on september 3 2015 on august 5 2016 the dor filed a response in which it denied all allegations noted in our appeal of the assessment 

during an extended remand period it was determined that grounds exist for a substantial reduction in the official assessment on the basis that i the transactions and resulting tax at issue were erroneously doublecounted by the dor in the audit sales transaction work papers on which the assessment was based and ii we were ultimately able to provide documentation showing that most of the remaining transactions were sales at wholesale therefore qualifying for the sale for resale exemption from georgia sales and use tax after these reductions the remaining amount of principal georgia sales and use tax still in dispute between the parties is 26 million  plus applicable interest a consent order to this effect was entered by the georgia tax tribunal on may 22 2017  since the date of entry of the consent order we and the dor have exchanged discovery requests and initial discovery responses we expect that discovery will be completed in the fall of 2017 we and the dor will then present the case to the tax tribunal for final disposition 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm advice from our outside tax advisors and our best estimate of a probable outcome we believe that we have adequately provided for the payment of any assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the remaining tax liability set forth above and intend to continue to defend this matter there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the dor we understand that litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk the republic of ireland brazil germany the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain india and spain  

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks finance companies charities fleet operators dealers and vehicles sourced directly from individual owners  we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us canada the republic of ireland brazil the uae oman bahrain india and spain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account in germany and spain we also derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue  our revenue consists of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenue and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where our fees are fixed based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program which we refer to as pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs not included in the consignment fee under the 

consignment program only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk we have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by several factors including total loss frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price as a significant amount of our service revenue is associated in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by i changes in commodity prices particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies as we believe this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii used car pricing which we also believe has an impact on total loss frequency iii the mix of cars sold and iv changes in the us dollar exchange rate to foreign currencies which we believe has an impact on auction participation by international buyers we cannot specifically quantify the financial impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles our service revenues or financial results total loss frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents which insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repairs costs used car values and auction returns over the last several years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in total loss frequency the increase in salvage frequency may have been driven by the decline in used car values relative to repair costs which we believe are generally trending upward conversely increases in used car prices such as occurred during the most recent recession may decrease total loss frequency and adversely affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road the average age of cars on the road continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 116 years in 2016 the factors that influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in total loss frequency 

operating costs and expenses  yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

other income and expense  other income primarily includes income from the rental of certain real property foreign exchange rate gains and losses and gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period other expense consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

liquidity and cash flows  our primary source of working capital is cash operating results and debt financing the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and revolving loan facility the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v total loss frequency vi increased volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix xi contract mix to the extent applicable and xii our capital expenditures these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of shares through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of additional debt with new lenders and equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future or on commercially acceptable terms 

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in the us canada the uk brazil the uae oman bahrain germany spain the republic of ireland and india with the intention of providing national coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2014 through july 31 2017  



 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it has been our practice and remains our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

the following table presents a comparison of service revenues for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



service revenues  the increase  in service revenues for fiscal 2017  of 1819 million  or 165  as compared to fiscal 2016  came from i an increase  in the us of 1704 million  and ii an increase  in international of 114 million  the increase  in the us was driven primarily by increased volume and a marginal increase in revenue per car due to higher average auction selling prices which we believe was due to higher commodity prices the increase in volume in the us was derived from i growth in the number of units sold from new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and ii growth from existing suppliers driven by what we believe was an increase in salvage frequency excluding a detrimental impact of 164 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate the increase  in international of 278 million was driven primarily by increased volume and an increase in revenue per car 

the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2016  of 1190 million  or 121  as compared to fiscal 2015  came from i growth in the us of 1104 million  and ii growth in international of 86 million  the growth in the us was driven primarily by increased volume partially offset by lower average auction selling prices which we believe was due to lower commodity prices the increase in volume in the us was derived from i growth from existing suppliers driven by what we believe was an increase in salvage frequency and ii growth in the number of units sold from new and expanded contracts with insurance companies excluding a detrimental impact of 118 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates the growth in international of 204 million was driven primarily by increased volume in the uk as we increased our market share and a marginal increase in revenue per car

the increase in vehicle sales for fiscal 2016  of 34 million  or 21  as compared to fiscal 2015  came from i an increase in the us of 27 million  and ii an increase in international of 06 million  the growth in the us was primarily the result of increased volume partially offset by lower average auction selling prices which we believe was due to lower commodity prices and a change in the mix of vehicles sold the growth in international was primarily the result of increased volume partially offset by a 70 million detrimental impact due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate and lower average selling prices driven by increased open market purchase activity from the general public 

the following table presents a comparison of yard operations expense for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



yard operations expenses  the increase  in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2017  of 955 million  or 164  as compared to fiscal 2016  resulted from i an increase  in the us of 914 million  primarily from growth in volume and a marginal increase in the cost to process each car and ii an increase  in international of 41 million  related primarily to growth in volume partially offset by the beneficial impact of 91 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate included in yard operations expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses the increase in yard operations depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from depreciating new and expanded facilities and certain technology assets placed into service in the us 

the increase in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2016  of 566 million  or 108  as compared to fiscal 2015  was the result of i an increase in the us of 536 million  primarily from growth in volume and a marginal increase in the cost to process each car and ii an increase in international of 30 million  related primarily to growth in volume in the uk partially offset by the beneficial impact of 70 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates included in yard operations expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses the decrease in yard operations depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from certain assets becoming fully depreciated in the us 

the following table presents a comparison of cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



cost of vehicle sales  the decrease  in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2017  of 34 million  or 24  as compared to fiscal 2016  was the result of i a decrease  in international of 90 million  partially offset by ii an increase  in the us of 56 million  excluding the beneficial impact of 104 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate the increase in international of 14 million was primarily the result of increased volume the increase  in the us was primarily the result of higher average purchase prices which we believe is due to higher commodity prices and a change in the mix of vehicles sold partially offset by a shift in volume for certain sellers from principal to agency business 

the decrease in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2016  of 45 million  or 33  as compared to fiscal 2015  was the result of i an increase  in the us of 36 million  and ii an increase in international of 09 million  the increase in the us was primarily the result of increased volume partially offset by lower average purchase prices which we believe was due to lower commodity prices and a change in the mix of vehicles sold the increase in international was primarily the result of increased volume partially offset by the beneficial impact of 56 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates and lower average purchases prices driven by increased open market purchase activity from the general public

general and administrative expenses  the increase  in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017  of 132 million  or 96  as compared to fiscal 2016  came primarily from an increase  in the us of 121 million  and an increase  in international of 12 million  excluding depreciation and amortization the increase  in the us of 103 million  resulted primarily from the impact of payroll taxes from the exercise of employee stock options an increase in professional services expenses acquisitionrelated expenses and charges related to sales tax and franchise tax adjustments the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  came primarily from depreciating certain technology assets placed into service in the us see notes to consolidated financial statements note 2 — acquisitions  

the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016  of 09 million  or 06  as compared to fiscal 2015  came primarily from a decrease in the us of 18 million  partially offset by an increase in international of 10 million  as we continue to expand in these markets the decrease in the us of 56 million  excluding depreciation and amortization resulted from decreased expenditures on technology development partially offset by the overall growth in labor costs and professional services associated with domestic expansion and increased stockbased payment compensation the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses came primarily from depreciating certain technology assets placed into service in the us 

the following table summarizes impairment total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



  

impairment  during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

other expense income  the increase  in total other expense for fiscal 2017  of 106 million  or 999  as compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to a decrease in currency gains in international primarily due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate and a change in the mix of currencies held in cash and cash equivalents 

the decrease in total other expense for fiscal 2016  of 17 million  or 140  as compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to increased currency gains in international primarily in the uk of 83 million partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 55 million as a result of the additional longterm debt issued in december 2014 march 2016 and july 2016 see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

income taxes  our effective income tax rates were 104  317  and 338  for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily the result of recognizing excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options of 1076 million  in fiscal 2017 as compared to 147 million in fiscal 2016  and the geographical allocation of our taxable income 

during the year ended july 31 2016 we adopted asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which impacted the accounting for sharebased payments including income tax consequences as a result of the adoption we recognized excess tax benefits of 147 million  as a reduction to tax expense in the consolidated statements of income as though asu 201609 had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal 2016 instead of reflected in stockholders’ equity the decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  was driven by the geographical allocation of our taxable income and the adoption of asu 201609 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  excluding additional funds available to us through our revolving loan facility 





cash and cash equivalents and working capital increased at july 31 2017  as compared july 31 2016  primarily due to cash generated from operations a decrease in repurchases of common stock and proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by payments for employee stockbased tax withholdings cash used for acquisitions and net repayments on our revolving loan facility cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits domestic certificates of deposit and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates cash and cash equivalents decreased at july 31 2016  as compared to july 31 2015  primarily due to repurchases of common stock as part of our tender offer and stock repurchase program capital expenditures and payments on longterm debt partially offset by cash generated from operations and proceeds from our revolving loan facility working capital increased at july 31 2016  as compared to july 31 2015  primarily due to cash generated from operations and proceeds from our revolving loan facility partially offset by repurchases of common stock as part of our tender offer and stock repurchase program capital expenditures payments on longterm debt and changes in operating assets 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees members’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales we expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business in addition to our stock repurchase program we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash balances and our cash flows from operations these alternative potential uses include additional stock repurchases repayments of longterm debt the payment of dividends and acquisitions for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt   and  note 11 — stockholders’ equity   and under the subheadings “ credit agreement ” and “ note purchase agreement ” below 

our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months we expect to acquire or develop additional locations and expand some of our current facilities in the foreseeable future we may be required to raise additional cash through drawdowns on our revolving loan facility or issuance of additional equity to fund this expansion although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business costs to develop a new yard can range from 10 to 300 million depending on size location and developmental infrastructure requirements 

as of july 31 2017  1675 million  of the  2101 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not require repatriation to fund our us operations

the note purchase agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants that limit or restrict us and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur indebtedness grant liens merge or consolidate dispose of assets make investments make acquisitions enter into transactions with affiliates pay dividends or make distributions and repurchase stock in each case subject to certain exceptions we are also required to maintain compliance measured at the end of each fiscal quarter with a consolidated total net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio the note purchase agreement contains no restrictions on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined as long as 1 the consolidated total net leverage ratio as defined both before and after giving effect to any such dividend or restricted payment on a pro forma basis is less than 325 1 in an unlimited amount 2 if clause 1 is not available so long as the consolidated total net leverage ratio both before and after giving effect to any such dividend on a pro forma basis is less than 350 1 in an aggregate amount not to exceed the available amount as defined and 3 if clauses 1 and 2 are not available in an aggregate amount not to exceed 500 million  provided that minimum liquidity as defined shall be not less than 750 million  both before and after giving effect to any such dividend or restricted payment as of july 31 2017  the consolidated total net leverage ratio was 083 1 minimum liquidity as of july 31 2017  was 8032 million  accordingly we do not believe that the provisions of the note purchase agreement represent a significant restriction to our ability to pay dividends or to the successful future operations of the business we have not paid a cash dividend since becoming a public company in 1994 we are in compliance with all covenants related to the note purchase agreement as of july 31 2017  

related to the execution of the credit agreement first amendment to credit agreement second amendment to credit agreement and the note purchase agreement we incurred 34 million  in costs of which 20 million  was capitalized as debt issuance fees and 14 million  was recorded as a reduction of the longterm debt proceeds as a debt discount during the year ended july 31 2016 we recognized an expense of 06 million  for prior capitalized costs into interest expense relating to the second amendment to credit agreement and payoff of the outstanding term loans both the debt issuance fees and debt discount are amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt instruments and are classified as reductions of the outstanding liability 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2017  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements pursuant to item 303a4 of regulation sk promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including costs related to vehicle pooling selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition stockbased payment compensation purchase price allocations longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we discuss where appropriate sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item i “financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current contracts collecting the proceeds from the member presale services including towing title processing preparation and storage as well as sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service net of applicable rebates or allowances for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle the revenue associated with the presale services is recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and determinable the selling price of each service is determined based on management’s best estimate and is allotted based on the relative selling price method 

vehicle sales where vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf are recognized on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legally binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multipleelement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting 

the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  topic 606 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605 revenue recognition  asu 201409 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract asu 201409 is effective for annual and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 asu 201409 allows adoption with either retrospective application to each period presented or retrospective application with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application asu 201409 will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 the three months ended october 31 2018 we are currently evaluating the impact of implementing asu 201409 on the consolidated financial statements as well as evaluating the transition alternatives 

while we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of asu 201409 we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our performance obligations through the determination of distinct and separately identifiable services which may be different from our current separate units of accounting under asu 200913 additionally changes in revenue recognition requirements regarding our performance obligations within our service contracts could potentially result in either the earlier recognition of revenue and associated costs for certain performance obligations or the deferral of a significant portion of revenue and associated costs for a vehicle until the sale is substantially complete due to the variety and complexity of our contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under asu 201409 may be dependent on contractspecific terms and vary in some instances 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in us gaap in accordance with asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

   

the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values for fiscal 2017  and 2016  due to the shortterm nature of those instruments and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  for additional fair value disclosures 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation for an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “abnormal” as provided in the guidance in addition the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life generally three years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets total gross capitalized software as of july 31 2017  and 2016  was 385 million  and 494 million  respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software as of july 31 2017  and 2016  totaled 257 million  and 209 million  respectively during the year ended july 31 2016 we retired fully amortized capitalized software of 298 million  which were no longer being utilized additionally during fiscal 2017 we recognized a 194 million  charge primarily related to fully impairing costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance a one percentage point adverse change to the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of 26 million  

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our reporting units annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present either through a quantitative or qualitative analysis we have historically evaluated goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fourth quarter or when an indicator of impairment exists during the year ended july 31 2017 we voluntarily changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment for our reporting units from the end of fiscal fourth quarter july 31 to the beginning of fiscal fourth quarter may 1 this voluntary change in the annual goodwill assessment date is a change in accounting principle which we believe is preferable as it more closely aligns the timing of the annual goodwill impairment assessment date with the most current information from our planning and forecasting process and also provides us with additional time to complete the annual assessment in advance of our yearend reporting this change in the annual assessment date does not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge this change was not applied retrospectively as it was impracticable to do so because retrospective application would require application of significant estimates and assumptions with the use of hindsight accordingly the change has been applied prospectively 

the annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed qualitatively during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  considered all relevant factors specific to our reporting units including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events  management considered the above factors noting none involved significant uncertainty in addition the industry in which we operate improved over the observable period and our calculated fair value exceeded carrying value for each reporting unit by a substantial amount in our prior year quantitative analysis indicating no material risk as of july 31 2017  with respect to potential goodwill impairments 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada the uk brazil spain germany and other emerging markets around the world in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate then we analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2017  we have 65 million  of valuation allowance arising from both our us and international operations to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision the repatriation of our accumulated foreign earnings could also affect our effective tax rate nevertheless we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations and do not anticipate the need for any of our foreign subsidiaries’ cash in the us operations accordingly we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 

based on our results for the year ended july 31 2017  a one percentage adverse change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase in the income tax expense of 44 million  

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc740 income taxes pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc740 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

stockbased payment compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method compensation cost related to stockbased payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes merton option pricing model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position during the year ended july 31 2016 we adopted asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which impacted the accounting for sharebased payments including income tax consequences as a result of the adoption we recognized excess tax benefits of 147 million  as a reduction to tax expense in the consolidated statements of income as though asu 201609 had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal 2016 instead of reflected in stockholders’ equity 

foreign currency translation 

we record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the us dollar reporting currency the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real indian rupee chinese renminbi and european union euro are the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries as they are the primary currencies within the economic environment in which each subsidiary operates the original equity investment in the respective subsidiaries is translated at historical rates assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiary’s operations are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period adjustments resulting from the translation of each subsidiary’s financial statements are reported in other comprehensive income 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000  deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which has a 500000  stop loss per person our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date including an estimate for reported and unreported claims the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue historically our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies was 53 million  as of july 31 2017  if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our annual medical expense would change by 20 million  and our accrual for medical expenses would change by 02 million  if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our annual workers’ compensation expense and our accrual for workers’ compensation expenses would change by less than 02 million  a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by an insignificant amount 

accounting for acquisitions 

we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquired entities in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  the accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates including the fair value of certain forms of consideration the fair value of acquired intangible assets which involve projections of future revenues cash flows and terminal value which are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate and the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities including potential contingencies and the useful lives of the assets the projections are developed using internal forecasts available industry and market data and estimates of longterm growth rates of our business historical experience is additionally utilized in which historical or current costs have approximated fair value for certain assets acquired 

segment reporting 

our us and international regions are considered two  separate operating segments and are disclosed as two  reportable segments the segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results including total revenues operating income and income before income taxes the segments continue to share similar business models services and economic characteristics our revenues for the year ended july 31 2017 were distributed as follows us 824  and international 176  geographic information as well as comparative segment revenues and related financial information pertaining to the us and international segments for the years ended july 31 2017  2016  and 2015 are presented in the tables in note 14 — segments and other geographic reporting  to the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included under in part ii item 8 of this 10k 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as of july 31 2017  as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2017  we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2017  a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement were 2310 million  as of july 31 2017  the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement bears interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050  or iii an adjusted libor rate determined on the basis of a onemonth interest period plus 10  in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 00  to 075  based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 100  to 175  depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate if interest rates were to increase by 10 our interest expense would increase by 24 million  

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk the uae brazil spain germany and india these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real euro and indian rupee our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real euro and indian rupee would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 68 million for fiscal 2017  

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and the uk’s future relationships with european union member states adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future 

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2017  the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss  of 1007 million  this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real indian rupee chinese renminbi and european union euro would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain brazil ireland spain and india we also provide vehicle remarketing services in germany 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships municipalities fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us canada brazil the uae oman bahrain ireland spain and india we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account and as an agent in germany and spain we also derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

we converted all of our us and canada sales to vb 2  during fiscal 2004 and we converted our uk sales to vb 2  during fiscal 2008 vb 2  opened our sales process to registered buyers whom we refer to as members anywhere in the world with access to the internet this technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility or over the internet during the preview period to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2  system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 ’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe the implementation of vb 2  increased the pool of available buyers for each sale which resulted in added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improved the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated with live auctions in august 2013 we launched our virtual bidding third generation vb3 an internet auctionstyle sales technology that was built on vb 2  vb3 adds several enhancements which focuses on expanding auction attendance and increasing bidding volume to attract new members and grow our membership base vb3 allows nonregistered members to view auctions via our website and our mobile applications in addition vb3 includes a completely redesigned auction interface enabling members to fit multiple auction windows on their screen while simultaneously viewing more vehicle photos and information at the time of live internet bidding 

for fiscal 2016  sales of us vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 491 of total vehicles sold 293 of vehicles were sold to out of state members within the us and 198 were sold to international members based on registration 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

 

historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in the overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in the amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both members and sellers and v the growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal 2016  our revenues were  13 billion  and our operating income was  4065 million  

in fiscal 2014 we acquired one facility in montreal canada a salvage vehicle auction business in brazil which did not include any facilities as well as the assets of an online marketing company which included the rights to hundreds of web domains including wwwcashforcarscom and wwwcash4carscom and opened facilities in seaford delaware and itaquaquecetuba brazil 

in fiscal 2015 we opened facilities in manama bahrain muscat oman and moncton canada 

in fiscal 2016 we opened facilities in sonepat india castledermot ireland algete spain dallas wilmer and temple texas colorado springs and denver colorado and cartersville georgia 

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs under the consignment program or fixed fee program only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees information technology and marketing expenses 

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion companies in our industry will purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based on the vehicles’ estimated preaccident cash value and the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and delivered to the buyer while most companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction we sell substantially all of our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies the primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer systems advanced cameras collision warning systems and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are costlier to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes the primary buyers of the vehicles are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some states the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

the majority of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its preaccident value pav or actual cash value acv the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav or acv as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the preaccident value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

 

in the uk some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles under these circumstances insurance companies will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order the assignment we arrange for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold either at a live auction or in our case on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller 

operating and growth strategy 

our growth strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing new facilities in key markets including foreign markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements and iii expanding our online auctions and vehicle remarketing service offerings to sellers and members in addition to maximize gross sales proceeds and cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities we introduce our i pricing structure ii selling processes iii operational procedures iv management information systems and v when appropriate redeploy existing personnel

pursue global national and regional vehicle supply agreements 

our broad global presence enhances our ability to enter into local regional national or global supply agreements with vehicle sellers we actively seek to establish national and regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities by utilizing our existing insurance company seller relationships we are able to build new seller relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets 

expand our service offerings to sellers and members

we strive to integrate all new facilities when appropriate into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle sellers we work with new sellers to implement our fee structures and new service programs we typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain knowledge about and respond to the local market we also assign a special integration team to help convert newly acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary software systems enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and sales systems 

technology to enhance and expand our business 

we have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering our proprietary software programs provide vehicle sellers with online access to data and reports regarding their vehicles being processed at any of our facilities this technology allows vehicle sellers to monitor each stage of our vehicle sales process from pick up to sale and settlement by the buyer our full range of internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process and minimizes the administrative and processing costs for us as well as our sellers we believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients resulting in high client retention and allow us to expand our national supply contracts

flexible vehicle processing programs 

at the election of the seller we sell vehicles pursuant to our percentage incentive program pip consignment program or purchase program 

percentage incentive program  our percentage incentive program is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle sellers under pip we agree to sell all of the vehicles of a seller in a specified market usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price because our revenues under pip are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return we provide the vehicle seller at our expense with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility as well as dmv document and title processing in addition we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather washing vehicle exteriors vacuuming vehicle interiors cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires making keys for drivable vehicles and identifying drivable vehicles we believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of the vehicles thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle sellers and us 

consignment program  under our consignment program we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs

we process vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle sellers no single customer accounted for more than 10  of our revenues for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  we obtained 83 of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2016  and 2015  and 81 for fiscal 2014  from insurance company sellers our arrangements with our sellers are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle sellers the agreements are customized to each vehicle seller’s particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle seller in a designated geographic area

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in the us include kar auction services inc formerly adesa inc and insurance auto auctions inc auction broadcasting company llc and manheim inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation lkq lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in our international markets our principal competitors are primarily privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary yard management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system which runs our proprietary software developed to process salvage sales vehicles throughout the auction process this system is integrated with the internet to enable buyers to view salvage vehicles and bid on them it is also integrated with the sellers system and enables the sellers to monitor their vehicles and analyze the progression of vehicles through the auction process our auctionstyle service product vb3 is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required 

we have invested in production data centers that are designed to continuously run the business even in the event of an emergency the data centers electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored the data centers are located in areas generally considered to be free of frequent weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes we operate fully redundant infrastructure to ensure ongoing operations even in the event of physical damage to one of our data centers 

we have developed a proprietary system to enable us to address our international expansion needs this proprietary system is designed to provide multilanguage and multicurrency capabilities we began using our new internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain and india in fiscal 2016 we intend to continue development of this system and implement in certain additional international locations during fiscal 2017 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and internally developed a proprietary solution in its place as a result in fiscal 2014 we recognized a charge of 291 million  resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs  in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  

employees 

as of july 31 2016  we had 4844  fulltime employees of whom 697 were engaged in general and administrative functions and 4147 were engaged in yard operations we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good employees per geographic region are as follows 



environmental matters 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and foreign motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in june 2003 we filed a provisional us patent application on vb 2  in the united states this provisional patent application was followed by a us utility application filed in july 2003 the patent was issued by the united states patent and trademark office on january 1 2008 generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

no single customer accounted for more than 10  of our revenue for fiscal 2016  historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues seller arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected revenues in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside the us including recent expansions in europe brazil the middle east and india expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired outside the us into our operations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside the us in fiscal 2003 with an acquisition in canada subsequently in fiscal 2008 we made a significant acquisition in the uk followed by acquisitions in the uae brazil germany and spain in fiscal 2013 expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015 and expansion into ireland and india in fiscal 2016 in addition we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside of the us acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside of the us pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in international markets among other things we will ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 



 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and the uk’s future relationships with european union member states adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the competition and markets authority uk regulator if an inquiry is made by the uk regulator we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulator will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the uk regulator determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulator the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in some cases the enforcement practices of governmental regulators in certain foreign areas and the procedural and substantive rights and remedies available to us may vary significantly from those in the united states which could have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not until our acquisition been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa uk bribery act brazil clean companies act indias prevention of corruption act 1998 or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the us market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in the us 

some of our target markets outside the us operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in the us for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in the us in which we generally act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in the us canada and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside the us canada and the uk we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

in general acquisitions increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

we have transitioned various functionality of our previously planned thirdparty enterprise operating system to an internally developed proprietary system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we work to develop and design this system 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and internally developed a proprietary solution in its place the ongoing design development and implementation of our enterprise operating systems carry certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the transition to our new internally developed proprietary system will require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance that the volume of business will increase we began using our new internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain and india in fiscal 2016 

we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due to among other things slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the impairment of capitalized development costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position during fiscal 2014 we recognized a 291 million  impairment charge primarily related to capitalized software development costs as we ceased development of a thirdparty enterprise operating system and decided to address our international technology needs through an internally developed proprietary solution 

any failure to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

information security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of in addition to other factors the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees in addition human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to cyberattacks including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system phishing attacks or other information technology data security incidents 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control 

cyberattacks or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation operating results or financial condition by among other things making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time damaging our reputation with buyers sellers and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including account data information or resulting in governmental investigations litigation liability fines or penalties against us if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of these cyber risks our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation 

we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions these attempts have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business in april 2015 we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to data provided to us by our members that is considered to be personal information in certain jurisdictions we immediately investigated including the engagement of an external expert security firm and made the required notifications to members whose information may have been accessed and to regulatory agencies 

we are constantly evaluating and implementing new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyberattacks and system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes we have further enhanced our security protocols based on the investigation we conducted in response to the security incident nevertheless we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address prior data security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future data security incidents or system failures will be successful the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyberattacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future if our systems are compromised again in the future become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet and other points of access while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and other obligations regarding privacy and data protection 

we are subject to federal state and international laws directives and regulations relating to the collection use retention disclosure security and transfer of personal data these laws directives and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices for example in october 2015 a european court decision invalidated the useu safe harbor framework which allowed us and other companies to meet certain european legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the european economic area to the us we may find it necessary or desirable to modify our data handling practices as a result of this court decision and it may serve as a basis for our personal data handling practices to be challenged or otherwise adversely impact our business noncompliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties legal proceedings by governmental entities or others and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to retain and attract customers any of the risks described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in the us canada and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

we implemented our online system across all of our us canada and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in those markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in the us canada and the uk we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita and sandy had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the united states we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2014 we acquired a facility in montreal canada in fiscal 2015 we opened new facilities in bahrain oman and moncton canada in fiscal 2016 we opened new facilities in castledermot ireland sonepat india algete spain and in the us promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

 

in addition certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 



 

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

 

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in the us canada brazil uae oman bahrain ireland and india we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate 211 of our common stock as of july 31 2016  if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer and vincent w mitz our president or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

cash investments are subject to risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public will involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2013 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricanes katrina rita and sandy weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory  and included the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices declines in used car prices and vehiclerelated technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates whether due to among other things a reduction in miles driven per car vehiclerelated technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and to the extent widely adopted the advent of driverless cars could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts or pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including but not limited to those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws or the interpretation of laws including foreign laws and regulations affecting the import and export of vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base as a result our foreign buyers may be subject to a variety of foreign laws and regulations including the imposition of import duties by foreign countries changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base in addition we and our vehicle buyers must work with foreign customs agencies and other nonus governmental officials who are responsible for the interpretation of these laws any inability to obtain requisite approvals or agreements from such authorities could adversely impact the ability of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries in addition any disputes or disagreements with foreign agencies or officials over import duties or similar matters including disagreements over the value assigned to imported vehicles could adversely affect our costs and the ability and costs of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad any failure to comply with nonus laws or regulatory interpretations or any legal or regulatory interpretations that significantly increase our costs or the costs of our buyers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services and our ability to compete in nonus markets 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or 

our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations as of july 31 2016  the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was  2602 million  

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in the definition of a business segment in which we operate changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations changes in competition or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization changes in these factors or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance could affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets which may result in an impairment charge for example continued deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required with respect to our acquisitions in the us canada the uk brazil germany the uae or spain we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets should the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

an adverse outcome of our appeal to the georgia tax tribunal of the georgia department of revenues final assessment in connection with its sales tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

the georgia department of revenue or dor has conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of their initial audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to collect and remit sales taxes totaling 738 million  including penalties and interest according to the dor the proposed assessment was based on its initial determination that our sales did not constitute nontaxable sales for resale 

subsequently we engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of proposed assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel provided us with an opinion that the sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply 

since our receipt of the notice of proposed assessment our counsel and we have engaged in active discussions with the dor to resolve the matter on june 5 2015  following our discussions and after additional review of documentation the dor provided us with revised audit work papers computing a sales tax liability of 27 million  before interest and any penalties 

on june 22 2015  representatives of the dor and the office of the attorney general for the state of georgia informed our counsel that the dor intended to issue a formal notice of assessment for an estimated 1000 million  based on the dor’s original proposed assessment of 738 million  plus additional accumulated interest and penalties on august 4 2015  the dor issued an official assessment and demand for payment for 961 million  for sales taxes penalties and interest that the dor alleges we owe the state of georgia we filed an appeal of this notice of assessment from the dor with the georgia tax tribunal on september 3 2015 on august 5 2016 the dor filed a response in which it denied all allegations noted in our appeal of the notice of assessment we continue to substantiate our position that these transactions are nontaxable sales for resale by providing the dor with documentation supporting the exempt nature of these sales 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm advice from our outside tax advisors and our best estimate of a probable outcome we believe that we have adequately provided for the payment of any assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the dor’s notice of assessment and intend to defend this matter there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the georgia dor we understand that litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real indian rupee and euro could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and the uk’s future relationships with european union member states adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future

 item 3 legal proceedings 

legal proceedings 

we are subject to threats of litigation and are involved in actual litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage contract disputes and handling or disposal of vehicles the material pending legal proceedings to which we are party or of which our property is subject include the following matters 

on november 1 2013 we filed suit against sparta consulting inc now known as kpit in the 44th judicial district court of dallas county texas alleging fraud fraudulent inducement andor promissory fraud negligent misrepresentation unfair business practices pursuant to california business and professions code § 17200 breach of contract declaratory judgment and attorney’s fees we seek compensatory and exemplary damages disgorgement of amounts paid attorney’s fees pre and postjudgment interest costs of suit and a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights duties and obligations under the implementation services agreement dated october 6 2011 the suit arises out of our september 17 2013 decision to terminate the implementation services agreement under which kpit was to design implement and deliver a customized replacement enterprise resource planning system for us on january 2 2014 kpit removed this suit to the united states district court for the northern district of texas on august 11 2014 the northern district of texas transferred the suit to the united states district court for the eastern district of california for convenience on january 8 2014 kpit filed suit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of california alleging breach of contract promissory estoppel breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing account stated quantum meruit unjust enrichment and declaratory relief kpit seeks compensatory and exemplary damages prejudgment interest costs of suit and a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights duties and obligations under the implementation services agreement on june 8 2016 we amended our complaint to include claims that kpit stole certain intellectual property owned by us and acted negligently in its provision of services we are pursuing our claim for damages and defending against kpit’s claim for damages 

we have provided for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when the insurance is purchased

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk brazil the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain ireland spain and india we also provide vehicle remarketing services in germany and spain 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us canada brazil the uae oman bahrain ireland spain and india we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account and as an agent in germany and spain we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue  our revenue consists of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenue and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where our fees are fixed based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs not included in the consignment fee under the consignment program 

only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk we have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by several factors including salvage frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price as a significant amount of our service revenue is associated in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by i changes in commodity prices particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies as we believe this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii used car pricing which we believe has an impact on salvage frequency iii the mix of cars sold and iv changes in the us dollar exchange rate to foreign currencies which we believe has an impact on auction participation by international buyers we cannot specifically quantify the financial impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles our service revenues or financial results salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents which insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repairs costs used car values and auction returns over the last several years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in salvage frequency the increase in salvage frequency may have been driven by the decline in used car values relative to repair costs which we believe are generally trending upward conversely increases in used car prices such as occurred during the most recent recession may decrease salvage frequency and adversely affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road new car sales grew on a year over year basis increasing the supply of used cars additionally the average age of cars on the road continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 115 years in 2015 the factors that influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in salvage frequency 

operating costs and expenses  yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

other income and expense  other income primarily includes income from the rental of certain real property foreign exchange rate gains and losses and gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period other expense consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

liquidity and cash flows  our primary source of working capital is cash operating results and debt financing the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and revolving loan facility the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v salvage frequency vi increased volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix xi contract mix to the extent applicable and xii our capital expenditures these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and if available if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in the us canada the uk brazil the uae oman bahrain germany spain ireland and india with the intention of providing national coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2013 through july 31 2016  



the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it has been our practice and remains our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary 

results of operations 

the following table shows certain data from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



comparison of fiscal years ended july 31 2016  2015  and 2014   

the following table presents a comparison of service revenues for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



service revenues  the increase  in service revenues for fiscal 2016  of 1190 million  or 121  as compared to fiscal 2015  came from i growth in the us of 1104 million  and ii growth in international of 86 million  the growth in the us was driven primarily by increased volume partially offset by lower average auction selling prices which we believe is due to lower commodity prices the increase in volume in the us was derived from i growth from existing suppliers driven by what we believe was an increase in salvage frequency and ii growth in the number of units sold from new and expanded contracts with insurance companies excluding a detrimental impact of 118 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates the growth in international of 204 million was driven primarily by increased volume in the uk as we increased our market share and a marginal increase in revenue per car 

the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2015  of 270 million  or 28  as compared to fiscal 2014  came from i growth in the us of 176 million  and ii growth in international of 94 million  the growth in the us was driven primarily by increased volume partially offset by a decrease in revenue per car due to lower average auction selling prices which we believe is due to lower commodity prices the increase in volume in the us primarily came from existing suppliers as we believe there may have been an increase in the overall growth in the salvage market driven by increased salvage frequency excluding a detrimental impact of 89 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates the growth in international of 183 million was driven primarily by increased volume in the uk as we increased our market share and a marginal increase in revenue per car 

the following table presents a comparison of vehicle sales for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



vehicle sales  the increase  in vehicle sales for fiscal 2016  of 34 million  or 21  as compared to fiscal 2015  came from i an increase in the us of 27 million  and ii an increase in international of 06 million  the growth in the us was primarily the result of increased volume partially offset by lower average auction selling prices which we believe is due to lower commodity prices and a change in the mix of vehicles sold the growth in international was primarily the result of increased volume partially offset by a 70 million detrimental impact due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate and lower average selling prices driven by increased open market purchase activity from the general public 

the decrease in vehicle sales for fiscal 2015  of 444 million  or 216  as compared to fiscal 2014  came from i a decline in international of 360 million  and ii a decline in the us of 84 million  the decline in international was primarily the result of decreased volume in the uk from insurance sellers and lower average auction selling prices driven by decreased insurance volume and increased open market purchase activity from the general public and included a 51 million detrimental impact due to changes in foreign currency exchanges rates primarily from the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate the decline in the us was primarily the result of decreased open market purchase activity from the general public and lower average auction selling prices which we believe is due to lower commodity prices 

the following table presents a comparison of yard operations expense for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



yard operations expenses  the increase  in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2016  of 566 million  or 108  as compared to fiscal 2015  came from i an increase in the us of 536 million  primarily from growth in volume and a marginal increase in the cost to process each car ii an increase in international of 30 million  related primarily to growth in volume in the uk partially offset by the beneficial impact of 70 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates included in yard operations expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses the decreases in yard operations depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from certain assets becoming fully depreciated in the us 

the increase in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2015  of 59 million  or 11  as compared to fiscal 2014  was the result of i an increase in the us of 28 million  primarily from growth in volume in the us and partially offset by a decrease in the cost to process each car in the us primarily driven by operational efficiencies and the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 ii a 31 million  increase in international primarily due to growth in volume partially offset by the beneficial impact of 48 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from changes in the british pound and the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rates included in our us yard operations expenses for fiscal 2014 were severance and lease termination costs of 40 million primarily associated with the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition

the decrease in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2015  of 381 million  or 218  as compared to fiscal 2014  came from i a decline in international of 304 million  which included the beneficial impact of 41 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily from the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate and ii a decline in the us of 77 million  the decline in international resulted primarily from decreased volume in the uk from insurance sellers and lower average purchase prices driven by decreased insurance volume and increased open market purchase activity from the general public the decline in the us was primarily the result of decreased open market purchase activity from the general public and lower average purchase prices 

the following table presents a comparison of general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



general and administrative expenses  the decrease  in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016  of 09 million  or 06  as compared to fiscal 2015  came primarily from a decrease in the us of 18 million  partially offset by an increase in international of 10 million  as we continue to expand in these markets the decrease in the us of 56 million  excluding depreciation and amortization resulted from decreased expenditures on technology development partially offset by the overall growth in labor costs and professional services associated with domestic expansion increased stockbased payment compensation and increased depreciation and amortization expenses the increases in depreciation and amortization expenses came primarily from depreciating certain technology assets placed into service in the us

the following table summarizes impairment total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



  

impairment  during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and internally developed a proprietary solution in its place as a result in fiscal 2014 we recognized a charge of  291 million  resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software 

other expense income  the decrease  in total other expense for fiscal 2016  of 17 million  or 140  as compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to increased currency gains in international primarily in the uk of 83 million partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 55 million as a result of the additional longterm debt issued in december 2014 march 2016 and july 2016 see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

the increase in total other expense for fiscal 2015  of 74 million  or 1517  as compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 94 million as a result of the additional longterm debt issued in december 2014 partially offset by increased currency gains in international primarily in the uk of 21 million see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt 

income taxes  our effective income tax rates were 317  338  and 338  for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively during the year ended july 31 2016  we early adopted asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which impacts the accounting for sharebased payments including income tax consequences as a result of the adoption we recognized excess tax benefits of 147 million  as a reduction to tax expense in the consolidated statements of income as though asu 201609 had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal 2016 instead of reflected in stockholders equity the decrease in the overall tax rate was driven by fluctuations in us tax laws the geographical allocation of our taxable income and the adoption of asu 201609 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  excluding additional funds available to us through our revolving loan facility 





cash and cash equivalents and working capital decreased for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to repurchases of common stock as part of our tender offer and stock repurchase program capital expenditures payments on longterm debt and changes in operating assets partially offset by cash generated from operations and the proceeds from our revolving loan facility cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits domestic certificates of deposit and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates cash and cash equivalents and working capital increased for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to issuance of longterm debt of 7000 million cash generated from operations and decreases in capital expenditures partially offset by increases in payments on longterm debt and repurchases of common stock 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees members’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months we expect to acquire or develop additional locations and expand some of our current facilities in the foreseeable future we may be required to raise additional cash through drawdowns on our revolving loan facility or issuance of additional equity to fund this expansion although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business costs to develop a new yard can range from 10 to 300 million depending on size location and developmental infrastructure requirements 

as of july 31 2016  1112 million of the  1558 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not require repatriation to fund our us operations 

net cash used in operating activities increased  for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  due to improved cash operating results from an increase in service revenues partially offset by an increase in yard operations expenses an increase in interest expense and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable of 523 million a decrease in accounts receivable of 338 million a decrease in income taxes receivable of 118 million and a decrease in other assets of 60 million 

net cash used in operating activities increased for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  due to improved cash operating results from an increase in service revenues and a decrease in general and administrative expenses partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in income taxes receivable of 101 million a decrease in accounts payable of 94 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 75 million partially offset by a decrease in other assets 

net cash used in investing activities increased  for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  due primarily to increases in capital expenditures our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities software development and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations we have no material noncancelable commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2016  included in capital expenditures were capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software the capitalized costs were 141 million 88 million and 165 million for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired during fiscal 2014 we recognized a charge of 291 million resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs  in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  

net cash used in investing activities decreased for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to decreases in capital expenditures and cash used in acquisitions 

net cash used in financing activities increased  in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to the repurchases of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program and our tender offer as discussed in further detail under the subheading  stock repurchases  and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt   and  note 11 — stockholders’ equity   and under the subheadings  credit agreement  and  note purchase agreement   

net cash used in financing activities increased for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the issuance of longterm debt and a 163 million change in bank overdraft partially offset by repurchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program and our tender offer as discussed in further detail under the subheading  stock repurchases  and decreased proceeds of 68 million from the exercise of stock options for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt   and  note 11 — stockholders’ equity   and under the subheadings  credit agreement  and  note purchase agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including costs related to vehicle pooling selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition stockbased payment compensation purchase price allocations longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we discuss where appropriate sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item i “financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current contracts collecting the proceeds from the member presale services including towing title processing 

preparation and storage as well as sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service net of applicable rebates or allowances for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle the revenue associated with the presale services is recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and determinable the selling price of each service is determined based on management’s best estimate and is allotted based on the relative selling price method 

vehicle sales where vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf are recognized on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multipleelement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting 

the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  topic 606 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605 revenue recognition  asu 201409 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract we are currently evaluating the impact of implementing asu 201409 on the consolidated financial statements as well as evaluating the adoption date and transition alternatives 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in us gaap in accordance with asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

   

the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values for fiscal 2016  and 2015  due to the shortterm nature of those instruments and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  for additional fair value disclosures 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation for an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “abnormal” as provided in the guidance in addition the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life generally three years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets total gross capitalized software as of july 31 2016  and 2015  was 494 million  and 651 million  respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software as of july 31 2016  and 2015  totaled 209 million  and 426 million  respectively during the year ended july 31 2016  we retired fully amortized capitalized software of 298 million  which were no longer being utilized 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and internally developed a proprietary solution in its place 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance a one percentage point adverse change to the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of 23 million  

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our reporting units annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the reporting units could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada the uk brazil spain germany and other emerging markets around the world in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate then we analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2016  we have 54 million  of valuation allowance arising from both our us and international operations to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision the repatriation of our accumulated foreign earnings could also affect our effective tax rate nevertheless we intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations and do not anticipate the need for any of our foreign subsidiaries’ cash in the us operations accordingly we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 

based on our results for the twelve months ended july 31 2016  a one percentage adverse change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase in the income tax expense of 40 million  

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc740 income taxes pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc740 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

stockbased payment compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method compensation cost related to stockbased payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes merton option pricing model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position during the year ended july 31 2016  we early adopted asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which impacts the accounting for sharebased payments including income tax consequences as a result of the adoption we recognized excess tax benefits of 147 million  as a reduction to tax expense in the consolidated statements of income as though asu 201609 had been in effect since the beginning of fiscal 2016 instead of reflected in stockholders equity 

foreign currency translation 

we record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the us dollar reporting currency the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real indian rupee and euro are the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries as they are the primary currencies within the economic environment in which each subsidiary operates the original equity investment in the respective subsidiaries is translated at historical rates assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiary’s operations are translated into us dollars at periodend exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period adjustments resulting from the translation of each subsidiary’s financial statements are reported in other comprehensive income 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000  deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which has a 500000  stop loss per person our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date including an estimate for reported and unreported claims the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue historically our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies is 53 million  as of july 31 2016  if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our annual medical expense would change by 18 million  and our accrual for medical expenses would change by 04 million  if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our annual workers’ compensation expense and our accrual for workers’ compensation expenses would change by less than 02 million  a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by an insignificant amount 

accounting for acquisitions 

we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquired entities in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  the accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates including the fair value of acquired intangible assets which involve projections of future revenues cash flows and terminal value which are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate and the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities including potential contingencies and the useful lives of the assets the projections are developed using internal forecasts available industry and market data and estimates of longterm growth rates of our business historical experience is additionally utilized in which historical or current costs have approximated fair value for certain assets acquired 

segment reporting 

our us and international regions are considered two  separate operating segments and are disclosed as two  reportable segments the segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results including total revenues operating income and income before income taxes the segments continue to share similar business models services and economic characteristics although recent changes in management structure and continued growth in our international region have resulted in the change in our reportable segments our revenues for the year ended july 31 2016 were distributed as follows us 801  and international 199  geographic information as well as comparative segment revenues and related financial information pertaining to the us and international segments for the years ended july 31 2016  2015  and 2014 are presented in the tables in note 14 — segments and other geographic reporting  to the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included under in part ii item 8 of this 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as of july 31 2016  as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2016  we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2016  a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement were 2380 million  as of july 31 2016  the revolving loan facility under the credit agreement bears interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050  or iii an adjusted libor rate determined on the basis of a onemonth interest period plus 10  in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 00  to 075  based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 100  to 175  depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate if interest rates were to increase by 10 our interest expense would increase by 24 million  

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk the uae brazil spain germany and india these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real euro and indian rupee our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real euro and indian rupee would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 66 million for fiscal 2016  

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union and the uk’s future relationships with european union member states adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future 

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2016  the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss  of 1092 million  this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real euro and indian rupee would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk the united arab emirates uae oman bahrain and brazil we also provide vehicle remarketing services in germany and spain 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us and canada north america brazil the uae oman and bahrain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account and as an agent in germany and spain we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

we converted all of our north american and uk sales to vb 2  during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 respectively vb 2  opened our sales process to registered buyers whom we refer to as members anywhere in the world with access to the internet this technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility or over the internet during the preview to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2  system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 ’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe the implementation of vb 2  increased the pool of available buyers for each sale which resulted in added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improved the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated with live auctions in august 2013 we launched our virtual bidding third generation vb3 an internet auctionstyle sales technology that was built on vb 2  vb3 adds several enhancements which focuses on expanding auction attendance and increasing bidding volume vb3 allows nonregistered members to view auctions via our website and our mobile applications to attract nonmembers and grow our membership base in addition vb3 includes a complete redesigned auction interface enabling members to fit multiple auction windows on their screen while simultaneously viewing more vehicle photos and information at the time of live internet bidding 

for fiscal 2015  sales of north american vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 487 of total vehicles sold 288 of vehicles were sold to out of state members and 199 were sold to out of country members based on registration for fiscal 2015  sales of uk vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the country where the vehicle was located accounted for 184 of total vehicles sold 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

 

historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in the overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in the amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both members and sellers and v the growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal 2015  our revenues were  11 billion  and our operating income was  3444 million  

in fiscal 2013 we acquired five new facilities in sao paulo brazil one facility in dubai uae one facility in ettlingen germany one facility in cordoba spain and 43 facilities in north america and we opened a new facility in webster new hampshire 

in fiscal 2014 we acquired one facility in montreal canada a salvage vehicle auction business in brazil which did not include any facilities as well as the assets of an online marketing company which included the rights to hundreds of web domains including wwwcashforcarscom and wwwcash4carscom and opened facilities in seaford delaware and itaquaquecetuba brazil 

in fiscal 2015 we opened facilities in manama bahrain muscat oman and moncton canada 

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs included in the consignment fee under the consignment program only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion companies in our industry will purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based either on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated preaccident cash value andor based on the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and delivered to the buyer while most companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction we sell all of our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies the primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer systems advanced cameras collision warning systems and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes the primary buyers of the vehicles are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some states the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally 

purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

the majority of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its preaccident value pav or actual cash value acv the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav or acv as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the preaccident value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

 

in the uk insurance companies generally tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles the insurance company will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order the assignment we arrange for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold either at a live auction or in our case on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller 

operating and growth strategy 

our growth strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing new facilities in key markets including foreign markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements iii expanding our online auctions and vehicle remarketing service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets and to new sellers within the vehicle market in addition to maximize gross sales proceeds and cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities we introduce our i pricing structure ii selling processes iii operational procedures iv management information systems and v when appropriate redeploy existing personnel 

as part of our overall expansion strategy our objective is to increase our revenues operating profits and market share in the vehicle sales industry to implement our growth strategy we intend to continue to do the following 

acquire and develop new vehicle storage facilities in key markets including foreign markets 

our strategy is to offer integrated services to vehicle sellers on a national or regional basis by acquiring or developing facilities in new and existing markets we integrate our new acquisitions into our global network and capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from among other things the reduction of duplicative overhead and the implementation of our operating procedures 

pursue national and regional vehicle supply agreements 

our broad national presence enhances our ability to enter into local regional or national supply agreements with vehicle sellers we actively seek to establish national and regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities by utilizing our existing insurance company seller relationships we are able to build new seller relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets 

expand our service offerings to sellers and members 

over the past several years we have expanded our available service offerings to vehicle sellers and members the primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize returns to our sellers and maximize product value to our members this includes for our sellers realtime access to sales data over the internet national coverage the ability to respond on a national scale and for our members the implementation of vb3 realtime bidding at all of our facilities permitting members at any location worldwide to participate in the sales at all of our yards we plan to continue to refine and expand our services including offering software that can assist our sellers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that help sellers integrate their systems with ours 

our competitive advantages

proven ability to acquire and integrate acquisitions 

we have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating vehicle storage facilities since becoming a public company in 1994 we have completed acquisitions of facilities in north america the uk the uae brazil germany and spain as part of our acquisition and integration strategy we seek to 

 

we strive to integrate all new facilities when appropriate into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle sellers we work with new sellers to implement our fee structures and new service programs we typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain knowledge about and respond to the local market we also assign a special integration team to help convert newly acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary software systems enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and sales systems 

technology to enhance and expand our business 

we have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering our proprietary software programs provide vehicle sellers with online access to data and reports regarding their vehicles being processed at any of our facilities this technology allows vehicle sellers to monitor each stage of our vehicle sales process from pick up to sale and settlement by the buyer our full range of internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process and minimizes the administrative and processing costs for us as well as our sellers we believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients resulting in high client retention and allow us to expand our national supply contracts 

our service offerings 

we offer vehicle sellers a full range of vehicle services which expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process maximizing proceeds and minimizing costs not all service offerings are available in all markets our service offerings include the following

endoflife vehicle processing 

in the uk we are an authorized treatment facility for the disposal of endoflife vehicles 

virtual insured exchange vix 

we provide the venue for insurance customers to enter a vehicle into a sealed bid sale to establish its true value thereby allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles 

transportation services 

we maintain contracts with thirdparty vehicle transport companies which enable us to pick up most of our sellers’ vehicles within 24 hours our national network and transportation capabilities provide cost and time savings to our vehicle sellers and ensure ontime vehicle pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters in north america in the uk we perform transportation services through a combination of our fleet of over 200 vehicles and thirdparty vehicle transport companies 

vehicle inspection stations 

we offer some of our major insurance company sellers office and yard space to house vehicle inspection stations onsite at our facilities we have over 90 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities an onsite vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company sellers with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles which reduces storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility 

ondemand reporting 

we provide vehicle sellers with real time data for vehicles that we process for the particular seller this includes vehicle sellers’ gross and net returns on each vehicle service charges and other data that enable our vehicle sellers to more easily administer and monitor the vehicle disposition process in addition we have developed a database containing over 240 fields of realtime and historical information accessible by our sellers allowing for their generation of custom ad hoc reports and customer specific analysis 

dmv processing 

we have extensive expertise in dmv document and title processing for salvage vehicles we have developed a computer system which provides a direct link to the dmv computer systems of several states allowing us to expedite the processing of vehicle title paperwork 

flexible vehicle processing programs 

at the election of the seller we sell vehicles pursuant to our percentage incentive program pip consignment program or purchase program 

percentage incentive program  our percentage incentive program is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle sellers under pip we agree to sell all of the vehicles of a seller in a specified market usually for a 

predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price because our revenues under pip are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return we provide the vehicle seller at our expense with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility as well as dmv document and title processing in addition we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather washing vehicle exteriors vacuuming vehicle interiors cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires making keys for drivable vehicles and identifying drivable vehicles we believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of the vehicles thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle sellers and us 

consignment program  under our consignment program we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs 

purchase program  under the purchase program we purchase vehicles from a vehicle seller at a formula price based on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated preaccident value pav or actual cash value acv and sell the vehicles for our own account currently the purchase program is offered primarily in the uk 

buy it now 

we offer an option to our members to purchase specific prequalified vehicles immediately at a set price before the live auction process this enables us to provide a fast easy transparent and comprehensive buying option on these prequalified vehicles 

member network 

we maintain a database of thousands of members in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair licensee used vehicle dealer and export industries as well as the general public as we sell directly to the general public at certain locations our database includes each member’s vehicle preference and purchasing history this data enables us to notify prospective buyers throughout the world via email of vehicles available for bidding that match their vehicle preferences listings of vehicles to be sold on a particular day and location are also made available on the internet 

sales process 

we offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles utilizing vb3 vb3 opens our sales process to registered members anywhere in the world who have internet access the vb3 technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb3 system lets a member see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb3’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf during all steps of the auction preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the highest preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time and then bid4u submits bids for the highest preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

copart dealer services 

we provide franchise and independent dealers with a convenient method to sell their tradeins through any of our facilities we have a dedicated group of employees in north america that target these dealers and work with them throughout the sales process 

copartdirect 

we provide the general public with a fast and convenient method to sell their vehicles to any of our north american facilities anyone can call 1888sellit1 and arrange to obtain a valid offer to purchase their vehicle upon acceptance of our offer to purchase their vehicle we give them a check for their vehicle and then sell the vehicle on our own behalf 

upullit 

in the uk we have two facilities from which the public can purchase parts from salvaged and endoflife vehicles in general the buyer is responsible for detaching the parts from the vehicle and any associated hauling or transportation of the parts after detachment after the valuable parts have been removed by the buyer the remaining parts and car body are sold for their scrap value 

sales 

we process vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle sellers no single customer accounted for more than 10  of our revenues for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  we obtained 83 of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2015  81 for fiscal 2014  and 82 for fiscal 2013  from insurance company sellers our arrangements with our sellers are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle sellers the agreements are customized to each vehicle seller’s particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle seller in a designated geographic area 

we market our services to vehicle sellers through an inhouse sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques including targeted mailing of our sales literature telemarketing followup personal sales calls internet search engines employee referrals tow shop referrals participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions we market our services to franchise and independent dealerships as well as the general public under copartdirect we may when appropriate provide vehicle sellers with detailed analysis of the net return on vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses 

during the last three years a majority of our revenue was generated within north america and a majority of our longlived assets are located within the united states please see note 13 — segments and other geographic reporting  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the geographic location of our sales and our longlived assets 

members 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered members in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair licensee used vehicle dealer and export industries we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing members with a variety of programs and services to become a registered member and gain admission to one of our sales prospective members must first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee provide requested personal and business information and have in most states a vehicle dismantler’s dealer’s resale repair or export license in certain venues we may sell to the general public registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements however nonregistered buyers may transact business at any of our sales via a registered broker who meets the local licensing and permitting requirements a member may also bring guests to a facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale we market to members on the internet and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in north america include kar auction services inc formerly adesa inc and insurance auto auctions inc auction broadcasting company llc and manheim inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation inc lkq lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in the uk our principal competitors are privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary yard management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system which runs our proprietary software developed to process salvage sales vehicles throughout the auction process this system is integrated with 

the internet to enable buyers to view salvage vehicles and bid on them it is also integrated with the sellers system and enables the sellers to monitor their vehicles and analyze the progression of vehicles through the auction process our auctionstyle service product vb3 is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required 

we have invested in production data centers that are designed to continuously run the business even in the event of an emergency the data centers electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored the data centers are located in areas generally considered to be free of frequent weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes 

we have recently started development on an internally developed proprietary system to enable us to address our international expansion needs this proprietary system is being designed to provide multilanguage and multicurrency capabilities we intend to continue development of this system and implement in certain international locations during fiscal 2016 and 2017 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place as a result we recognized a charge of 291 million  resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs  in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  

employees 

as of july 31 2015  we had 4267  fulltime employees of whom 624 were engaged in general and administrative functions and 3643 were engaged in yard operations we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good employees per geographic region are as follows 



environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oils and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination certain of our facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in aboveground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be disposed of as nonhazardous or hazardous waste as appropriate we have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities and we have initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional capital expenditures 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and international motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in june 2003 we filed a provisional us patent application on vb 2  in the united states this provisional patent application was followed by a us utility application filed in july 2003 the patent was issued by the united states patent and trademark office on january 1 2008 generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application in fiscal 2004 we received a patent from australia the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents 




 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

no single customer accounted for more than 10  of our revenue for fiscal 2015  historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues seller arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside north america including recent expansions in europe brazil and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired outside of north america into our operations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside north america in fiscal 2008 with a significant acquisition in the uk followed by acquisitions in the uae brazil germany and spain in fiscal 2013 and expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015 in addition we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside north america acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside north america pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in international markets among other things we will ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any 

assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the competition and markets authority uk regulator if an inquiry is made by the uk regulator we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulator will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the uk regulator determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulator the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not until our acquisition been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa uk bribery act brazil clean companies act or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the north american market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in north america 

some of our target markets outside north america operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in north america for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in north america in which we act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in north america and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside north america and the uk we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

in general acquisitions increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

we are transitioning various functionality of our thirdparty enterprise operating system to an internally developed proprietary system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we work to develop and design this system 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place the transition of our enterprise operating system carries certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the transition to our new internal proprietary system will require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance that the volume of business will increase 

we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due to among other things slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the impairment of capitalized development costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position during fiscal 2014 we recognized a 291 million  impairment charge primarily related to capitalized software development costs as we ceased development of a thirdparty enterprise operating system and decided to address our international technology needs through an internally developed proprietary solution 

any failure to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

information security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of in addition to other factors the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees in addition human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to cyberattacks including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system phishing attacks or other information technology data security incidents 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control 

cyberattacks or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation operating results or financial condition by among other things making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time damaging our reputation with buyers sellers and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including account data information or resulting in governmental investigations litigation liability fines or penalties against us if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of these cyber risks our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation 

we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions these attempts have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business in april 2015 we identified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to data provided to us by our members that is considered to be personal information in certain jurisdictions we immediately investigated including the engagement of an external expert security firm and made the required notifications to members whose information may have been accessed and to regulatory agencies 

we are constantly evaluating and implementing new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyberattacks and system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes we have further enhanced our security protocols based on the investigation we conducted in response to the recently discovered data breach nevertheless we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address prior data security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future data security incidents or system failures will be successful the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyberattacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future if our systems are compromised again in the future become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices and the rules of the online auto auction industry we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in north america and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

we implemented our online system across all of our north american and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in both markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in north america and the uk we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita and sandy had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the united states we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2013 we acquired new facilities in sao paulo brazil the uae ettlingen germany cordoba spain and in north america in fiscal 2014 we acquired a facility in montreal canada in fiscal 2015 we opened new facilities in bahrain oman and moncton canada furthermore promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in 

the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

 

in addition certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

 

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

 16 

 

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our north american and brazilian storage facilities we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate 192 of our common stock as of july 31 2015  if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer vincent w mitz our president and william e franklin our executive vice president and chief financial officer or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

cash investments are subject to risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public may involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2013 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricanes katrina rita and sandy weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory  and included the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices declines in used car prices and vehiclerelated technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates whether due to among other things vehiclerelated technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and to the extent widely adopted the advent of driverless cars could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts or pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws affecting the importation of salvage vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of salvage vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of salvage vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for salvage vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations in recent years the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets has increased substantially principally as a result of a series of acquisitions we have made in north america the uk brazil germany the uae and spain in fiscal 2013 and 2014 as of july 31 2015  the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was  2719 million  

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the 

determination is made the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in the definition of a business segment in which we operate changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations changes in competition or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization changes in these factors or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance could affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets which may result in an impairment charge for example continued deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required with respect to our acquisitions in north america the uk brazil germany the uae or spain we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets should the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

an adverse outcome of our appeal to the georgia tax tribunal of the georgia department of revenues final assessment in connection with its sales tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

the georgia department of revenue or dor has conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of their initial audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to collect and remit sales taxes totaling 738 million  including penalties and interest according to the dor the proposed assessment was based on its initial determination that our sales did not constitute nontaxable sales for resale 

subsequently we engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of proposed assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel provided us with an opinion that the sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply 

since our receipt of the notice of proposed assessment our counsel and we have engaged in active discussions with the dor to resolve the matter on june 5 2015  following our most recent discussions and after additional review of documentation the dor provided us with revised audit work papers computing a sales tax liability of 27 million  before interest and any penalties 

on june 22 2015  representatives of the dor and the office of the attorney general for the state of georgia informed our counsel that the dor intended to issue a formal notice of assessment for an estimated 1000 million  based on the dor’s original proposed assessment of 738 million  plus additional accumulated interest and penalties on august 4 2015  the dor issued an official assessment and demand for payment for 961 million  for sales taxes penalties and interest that the dor alleges we owe the state of georgia we filed an appeal of this notice of assessment from the dor with the georgia tax tribunal on september 3 2015 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm advice from our outside tax advisors and our best estimate of a probable outcome we believe that we have adequately provided for the payment of any assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the dor’s notice of assessment and intend to defend this matter there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the georgia dor we understand that litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real and euro could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with our credit facility prove ineffective it could result in volatility in our operating results including potential losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payment commitments for fixed interest rate payments on our variable interest rate debt through december 2015 we recorded the swaps at fair value and are currently designated as an effective cash flow hedge under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  each quarter we measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method” and record in earnings any gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness the hedge provided by our swaps could prove to be ineffective for a number of reasons including early retirement of the variable interest rate debt as is allowed under the variable interest rate debt or in the event the counterparty to the interest rate swaps are determined in the future to not be creditworthy any determination that the hedge created by the swaps is ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and result in volatility in our operating results in addition any changes in relevant accounting standards relating to the swaps especially asc 815 derivatives and hedging  could materially increase earnings volatility

 item 3 legal proceedings 

legal proceedings 

we are subject to threats of litigation and are involved in actual litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage and handling or disposal of vehicles the material pending legal proceedings to which we are party to or of which our property is subject to include the following matters 

on november 1 2013 we filed suit against sparta consulting inc now known as “kpit” in the 44th judicial district court of dallas county texas alleging fraud fraudulent inducement andor promissory fraud negligent misrepresentation unfair business practices pursuant to california business and professions code § 17200 breach of contract declaratory judgment and attorney’s fees we seek compensatory and exemplary damages disgorgement of amounts paid attorney’s fees pre and postjudgment interest costs of suit and a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights duties and obligations under the implementation services agreement dated october 6 2011 the suit arises out of our september 17 2013 decision to terminate the implementation services agreement under which kpit was to design implement and deliver a customized replacement enterprise resource planning system for us on january 2 2014 kpit removed this suit to the united states district court for the northern district of texas on august 11 2014 the northern district of texas transferred the suit to the united states district court for the eastern district of california for convenience on january 8 2014 kpit filed suit against us in the 

united states district court for the eastern district of california alleging breach of contract promissory estoppel breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing account stated quantum meruit unjust enrichment and declaratory relief kpit seeks compensatory and exemplary damages prejudgment interest costs of suit and a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights duties and obligations under the implementation services agreement we are pursuing our claim for damages and defending kpit’s claim for damages 

we have provided for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when the insurance is purchased 

governmental proceedings 

the georgia department of revenue or dor has conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of their initial audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to collect and remit sales taxes totaling 738 million  including penalties and interest according to the dor the proposed assessment was based on its initial determination that our sales did not constitute nontaxable sales for resale

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk brazil the united arab emirates uae oman and bahrain we also provide vehicle remarketing services in germany and spain 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us and canada north america brazil the uae oman and bahrain we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account and as an agent in germany and spain we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue  our revenue consists of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenue and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where our fees are fixed based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs not included in the consignment fee under the consignment program only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales 

transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk we have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by several factors including salvage frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price as over 50 of our service revenue is associated in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by i changes in commodity prices particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies as this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii used car pricing which we believe has an impact on salvage frequency and iii the mix of cars sold as insurance company cars on average command a lower average selling price than noninsurance cars we cannot determine the impact of the movement of these influences as we cannot determine which vehicles are sold to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export we also cannot predict the future movements of these influences accordingly we cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles and ultimately on service revenue salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents which insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repairs costs used car values and auction returns over the last several years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in salvage frequency the increase in salvage frequency may have been driven by the decline in used car values relative to repair costs conversely increases in used car prices such as occurred during the most recent recession may decrease salvage frequency and adversely affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including the used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road new car sales grew on a year over year basis increasing the supply of used cars additionally the average age of cars on the road continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 115 years in 2014 these factors among others have led to a general decline in used car values while repair costs are generally trending upward the factors that influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in salvage frequency 

operating costs and expenses  yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

other income and expense  other income primarily includes income from the rental of certain real property foreign exchange rate gains and losses and gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period other expense consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

liquidity and cash flows  our primary source of working capital is cash operating results the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v salvage frequency vi increased volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and if available if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america the uk brazil the uae oman bahrain germany and spain with the intention of providing national coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2012 through july 31 2015  





 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it is our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary 

results of operations 

the following table shows certain data from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



comparison of fiscal years ended july 31 2015  2014  and 2013   

the following table presents a comparison of service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



service revenues  the increase  in service revenues for fiscal 2015  of 270 million  or 28  as compared to fiscal 2014  came from i growth in north america of 186 million ii growth in the uk of 64 million and iii growth in our other international markets of 20 million the growth in north america was driven primarily by increased volume partially offset by a decrease in revenue per car due to lower average auction selling prices which we believe is due to lower commodity prices the increase in volume in north america primarily came from existing suppliers as we believe there may have been an increase in the overall growth in the salvage market driven by increased salvage frequency excluding a detrimental impact of 58 million due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate the growth in the uk of 64 million was driven primarily by increased volume as we increased our market share and a marginal increase in revenue per car 

the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2014  of 1087 million  or 128  as compared to fiscal 2013  came from i growth in north america of 767 million ii growth in the uk of 237 million driven by increased volume from our vehicle suppliers and iii our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into germany spain the uae and brazil which represented 83 million excluding the increase in revenues in fiscal 2013 associated with hurricane sandy of 312 million north america service revenue grew by 1079 million or 147 the growth in north america was driven primarily by increased volume as revenue per car remained relatively flat the increase in volume came from the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and increases from existing suppliers as we believe there may have been an increase in the overall growth in the salvage market driven by increased salvage frequency 

vehicle sales  the decrease  in vehicle sales for fiscal 2015  of 444 million  or 216 as compared to fiscal 2014  came from i a decline in the uk of 318 million ii a decline in north america of 81 million and iii a decline in our other international markets of 45 million the decline in the uk was primarily the result of decreased volume from insurance sellers and lower average auction selling prices driven by decreased insurance volume and increased open market purchase activity from the general public and included a 51 million detrimental impact due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate the decline in north america was primarily the result of decreased open market purchase activity from the general public and lower average auction selling prices which we believe is due to lower commodity prices the decline in our other international markets was driven primarily by reduced volume 

the increase in vehicle sales for fiscal 2014  of 84 million  or 42  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily came from i our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into germany spain the uae and brazil which represented 48 million ii growth in the uk of 23 million driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity from the general public and iii growth in north america of 13 million driven primarily by the acquisition of salvage parent inc 

the following table summarizes operating expenses total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



yard operations expense  the increase  in yard operations expense for fiscal 2015  of 59 million  or 11  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily came from i growth in volume in north america the uk and in our other international markets ii partially offset by a decrease in the cost to process each car in north america primarily driven by operational efficiencies and the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition and iii the beneficial impact of 35 million in the uk due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate included in our yard operations expenses for fiscal 2014 were severance and lease termination costs of 40 million primarily associated with the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition 

included in yard operations cost was depreciation and amortization expenses which were 349 million  362 million  and 408 million for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the decrease in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 resulted primarily from certain assets becoming fully amortized in north america the decrease in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was due primarily to our data center assets being fully depreciated 

the increase in yard operations expense for fiscal 2014  of 622 million  or 136  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily came from i growth in north america driven by the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 increased volume from what we believe to be an increase in the overall size of the salvage market due to increased salvage frequency and increases in volume from noninsurance suppliers ii growth in the uk driven by increased volumes from our new and existing suppliers and iii growth in our international activity outside of the uk as these operations are in their developmental stages without the benefit of scale included in our yard operations expense in fiscal 2013  was 257 million of abnormal costs associated with hurricane sandy excluding those costs the average handling cost per car increased driven primarily by growth in normal subhaul labor equipment and titling costs as well as charges associated with severance and lease termination costs of 29 million primarily associated with the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition 

cost of vehicle sales  the decrease  in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2015  of 381 million  or 218  as compared to fiscal 2014  came from i a decline in the uk of 269 million which included the benefical impact of the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate of 40 million ii a decline in north america of 69 million and iii a decline in our other international markets of 43 million the decline in the uk resulted from decreased volume from insurance sellers and 

lower average purchase prices driven by decreased insurance volume and increased open market purchase activity from the general public the decline in north america was primarily the result of decreased open market purchase activity from the general public and lower average purchase prices 

the increase in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2014  of 73 million  or 43  as compared to fiscal 2013  came from i our international expansion during the prior fiscal year which represented 48 million ii growth in the uk of 21 million driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity from the general public and iii growth in north america of 03 million driven primarily by the acquisition of salvage parent inc 

general and administrative expenses  the decrease  in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015  of 256 million  or 155  as compared to fiscal 2014  came primarily from a decrease in north america of 237 million as a result of the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition the relocation of our technology department being completed in fiscal 2014 decreased expenditures on technology development and a decrease in stockbased payment compensation included in fiscal 2014 was 75 million in lease termination severance and relocation costs associated with the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition and the relocation of our technology department from california to our dallas texas corporate headquarters 

included in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 117 million  175 million  and 160 million for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 came primarily from a decrease in north america as a result of certain assets becoming fully amortized 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014  of 266 million  or 193  as compared to fiscal 2013  increased primarily from i our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into germany spain the uae and brazil representing 37 million and ii growth in north america of 196 million driven primarily by the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 increased expenditures on technology development and the overall growth in labor costs professional services and facilities costs associated with domestic and international expansion 

impairment  during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place as a result we recognized a charge of 291 million  resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software 

other expense income  the increase  in total other expense for fiscal 2015  of 74 million  or 1517  as compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 94 million as a result of the additional longterm debt issued in december 2014 partially offset by increased currency gains in the uk of 21 million see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

the decrease in total other expense for fiscal 2014  of 12 million  or 200  as compared to fiscal 2013  was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of principal payments on longterm debt 

income taxes  our effective income tax rates were 338  338  and 350  for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the decrease in the overall tax rate was driven by fluctuations in the us tax laws and the geographical allocation of our taxable income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  





working capital and cash and cash equivalents increased for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to issuance of longterm debt of 7000 million cash generated from operations and decreases in capital expenditures partially offset by increases in payments on longterm debt and repurchases of common stock cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits domestic certificates of deposit and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates working capital and cash and cash equivalents increased for fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to cash generated from operations partially offset by decreases in capital expenditures payments on longterm debt and cash used in acquisitions 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees members’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business costs to develop a new yard generally range from 10 to 130 million depending on size location and developmental infrastructure requirements 

as of july 31 2015  820 million of the  4560 million  of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

net cash provided by operating activities increased for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  due to improved cash operating results from an increase in service revenues and a decrease in general and administrative expenses partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in income taxes receivable of 101 million a decrease in accounts payable of 94 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 75 million partially offset by an decrease in other assets 

net cash provided by operating activities increased for fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  due to improved cash operating results from an increase in revenue and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was related to the lower growth in accounts receivables of 183 million primarily due to the prior year effect of hurricane sandy a decrease in prepaid and other assets of 113 million offset by an increase in accounts payable of 93 million 

net cash used in investing activities decreased for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  due primarily to decreases in capital expenditures and cash used in acquisitions our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities software development and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations we have no material noncancelable commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2015  included in capital expenditures were capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software the capitalized costs were 88 million 165 million and 193 million for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired during fiscal 2014 we recognized a charge of 291 million resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs  in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  

net cash used in investing activities decreased for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to significant land acquisitions during fiscal 2013 related to our first facilities in brazil and germany and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions acquisition related capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 were 840 million primarily for the acquisition of salvage parent inc and acquisitions for international expansion 

net cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to the issuance of longterm debt and a 163 million change in bank overdraft partially offset by repurchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program and our tender offer as discussed in further detail under the subheading  stock repurchases  and decreased proceeds of 68 million from the exercise of stock options for further detail see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt   and  note 10 — stockholders’ equity   and under the subheadings  credit agreement  and  note purchase agreement   

net cash used in financing activities increased for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 predominantly due to a 163 million change in bank overdraft decreased proceeds of 110 million from the exercise of stock options and a 38 million reduction in tax benefits from stockbased payment compensation partially offset by a 217 million decrease in payments on longterm debt and a 144 million decrease in common stock repurchases see notes to consolidated financial statements note 10 — stockholders’ equity

additionally on july 9 2015  we completed a tender offer to purchase up to 13888888  shares of our common stock at a purchase price not greater than  3600  nor less than 3475  per share in connection with the tender offer we accepted for payment an aggregate of 6254061  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 3600  per share for a total value of 2251 million  the shares repurchased as a result of the tender offer are not part of our repurchase program the purchases of the shares of common stock were funded by the proceeds relating to the issuance of longterm debt 

during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  certain executive officers and employees exercised stock options through cashless exercises a portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price and federal and state minimum statutory tax withholding requirements the company remitted 38 million  01 million  and 06 million  for the years ended july 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees’ minimum statutory withholding requirements

the term loan which as of july 31 2015  had 2438 million  outstanding amortizes 188 million  each quarter beginning december 31 2014 through december 31 2015 then amortizes  75 million  each quarter with all outstanding borrowings due on december 3 2019  all amounts borrowed under the term loan may be prepaid without premium or penalty 

the revolving and term loans under the credit agreement bear interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050  or iii an adjusted libor rate determined on the basis of a onemonth interest period plus 10  in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 025  to 10  based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 125  to 20  depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate the interest rate as of july 31 2015  on our variable interest rate debt was the one month libor rate of 019  plus an applicable margin of 125  the carrying amount of the credit agreement is comprised of borrowings under which interest accrues under a fluctuating interest rate structure accordingly the carrying value approximates fair value at july 31 2015  and was classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy 

amounts borrowed under the revolving loan facility may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date of december 3 2019  we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility the commitment fee rate ranges from 020  to 035  depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment under the credit agreement we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan facility as of july 31 2015  

our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the credit agreement such obligations including the guaranties are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors pursuant to a security agreement dated december 3 2014  among us the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and wells fargo bank national association as collateral agent

we may prepay the senior notes in whole or in part at any time subject to certain conditions including minimum amounts and payment of a makewhole amount equal to the discounted value of the remaining scheduled interest payments under the senior notes 

our obligations under the note purchase agreement are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the note purchase agreement such obligations including the guaranties are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and the subsidiary guarantors our obligations and our subsidiary guarantors under the note purchase agreement will be treated on a pari passu basis with the obligations of those entities under the credit agreement as well as any additional debt that we may obtain

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2015  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements pursuant to item 303a4 of regulation sk promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including costs related to vehicle pooling selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition stockbased payment compensation purchase price allocations longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we discuss where appropriate sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item i “financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current north american contracts collecting the proceeds from the member presale services including towing title processing preparation and storage as well as sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service net of applicable rebates or allowances for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle the revenue associated with the presale services is recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and determinable the selling price of each service is determined based on management’s best estimate and is allotted based on the relative selling price method 

vehicle sales where vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf are recognized on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multipleelement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting 

the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in us gaap in accordance with asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

   

the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values for fiscal 2015  and 2014  due to the shortterm nature of those instruments and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  for additional fair value disclosures 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation for an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “abnormal” as provided in the guidance in addition the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

in early november 2012 hurricane sandy hit the northeastern coast of the united states as a result of the extensive flooding that it caused we expended additional costs for i temporary storage facilities ii premiums for subhaulers as they were reassigned from other regions and iii labor costs incurred for overtime travel and lodging due to the reassignment of employees to the affected region these costs which are characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory  were expensed as incurred and not included in inventory as of july 31 2013 the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of hurricane sandy were sold 

derivatives and hedging 

we have entered into two interest rate swaps to eliminate interest rate risk on our variable rate term loan and the swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  see notes to consolidated financial statements note 9 — derivatives and hedging  each quarter we measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method” and record in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness with the effective portion of the hedges’ change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income or loss 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life generally three years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets total gross capitalized software as of july 31 2015  and 2014  was 651 million  and 617 million  respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software as of july 31 2015  and 2014  totaled 426 million  and 386 million  respectively 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place as a result we recognized a charge of 291 million  resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance a one percentage point adverse change to the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of 19 million  

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada the uk brazil spain germany and other emerging markets around the world in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate then we analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2015  we have 27 million  of valuation allowance arising from both our us and foreign operations to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision the repatriation of our accumulated foreign earnings could also affect our effective tax rate nevertheless we intent to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in our foreign operations and do not anticipate the need for any of our foreign subsidiaries’ cash in the us operations accordingly we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 

based on our results for the twelve months ended july 31 2015  a one percentage adverse change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase in the income tax expense of 33 million  

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc740 income taxes pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc740 further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

stockbased payment compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method compensation cost related to stockbased payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes merton option pricing model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000  deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which has a 225000  stop loss per claim and a stop loss limiting total exposure to 120  of expected claims in addition each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss to limit our ultimate exposure our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue historically our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies is 58 million  as of july 31 2015  if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our annual medical expense would change by 14 million  and our accrual for medical expenses would change by 04 million  if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our annual workers’ compensation expense and our accrual for workers’ compensation expenses would change by less than 02 million  a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by an insignificant amount 

accounting for acquisitions 

we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquired entities in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  the accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates including the fair value of acquired intangible assets which involve projections of future revenues cash flows and terminal value which are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate and the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities including potential contingencies and the useful lives of the assets the projections are developed using internal forecasts available industry and market data and estimates of longterm growth rates of our business historical experience is additionally utilized in which historical or current costs have approximated fair value for certain assets acquired 

segment reporting 

our north american and uk regions are considered two  separate operating segments which have been aggregated into one  reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as of july 31 2015  as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2015  we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2015  a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the credit agreement were 2438 million  as of july 31 2015  the revolving and term loans under the credit agreement bear interest at our election at either a the base rate which is defined as a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the prime rate in effect on such day ii the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 050  or iii an adjusted libor rate determined on the basis of a onemonth interest period plus 10  in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 025  to 10  based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter or b an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 125  to 20  depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio during the preceding fiscal quarter interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted libor rate if interest rates were to increase by 10 our interest expense would increase but by an insignificant amount due to the fixed interest rate swaps we have entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments through december 2015 to mitigate the interest expense risk 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk the uae brazil spain and germany these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real and euro our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real and euro would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of 56 million for fiscal 2015  

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2015  the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss  of 685 million  this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham bahraini dinar omani rial brazilian real and euro would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk and brazil we also provide vehicle remarketing services in the united arab emirates uae germany and spain 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial 

institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us and canada north america brazil and the uae we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account and as an agent in germany and spain we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

we converted all of our north american and uk sales to vb 2 during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 respectively vb 2 opened our sales process to registered buyers whom we refer to as members anywhere in the world who have internet access this technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility or over the internet during the preview to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 ’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe the implementation of vb 2 increased the pool of available buyers for each sale which resulted in added competition and an increase in the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it improved the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated with live auctions in august 2013 we launched our virtual bidding third generation vb3 an internet auctionstyle sales technology that was built on vb 2  vb3 adds several enhancements which focuses on expanding auction attendance and increasing bidding volume vb3 allows nonregistered members to view auctions via our website and our mobile application to attract nonmembers and grow our membership base in addition vb3 includes a complete redesigned auction interface enabling members to fit multiple auction windows on their screen while simultaneously viewing more vehicle photos and information at the time of live internet bidding 

for fiscal 2014 sales of north american vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 513 of total vehicles sold 287 of vehicles were sold to out of state members and 226 were sold to out of country members based on registration for fiscal 2014 sales of uk vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the country where the vehicle was located accounted for 186 of total vehicles sold 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

 2 

     historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in the overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both members and sellers and v the growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal 2014 our revenues were 12 billion and our operating income was 2749 million 

in fiscal 2012 we acquired two new facilities located in calgary and edmonton canada and we opened two new facilities in atlanta georgia and burlington north carolina 

in fiscal 2013 we acquired five new facilities in sao paulo brazil one facility in dubai united arab emirates uae one facility in ettlingen germany one facility in cordoba spain and 43 facilities in north america and we opened a new facility in webster new hampshire 

in fiscal 2014 we acquired one facility in montreal canada a salvage vehicle auction business in brazil which did not include any facilities as well as the assets of an online marketing company which included the rights to hundreds of web domains including wwwcashforcarscom and wwwcash4carscom and opened facilities in seaford delaware and itaquaquecetuba brazil 

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs included in the consignment fee under the consignment program only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion companies in our industry will purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based either on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated preaccident cash value andor based on the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and delivered to the buyer while most companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction we sell all of our vehicles on our internet selling platform vb3 thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies the primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

automobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features including unibody construction utilizing exotic metals passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic and ceramic components airbags adaptive headlights computer systems advanced cameras collision warning systems and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes the primary buyers of the vehicles are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some states the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the general public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

the majority of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its preaccident value pav or actual cash value acv the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs vehicle’s salvage value and the pav or acv as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the preaccident value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

     4 

  in the uk insurance companies generally tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles the insurance company will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pickup order the assignment we arrange for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle invoiced separately to the seller or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold either at a live auction or in our case on vb3 typically within seven days proceeds are then collected from the member seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller 

operating and growth strategy 

our growth strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing new facilities in key markets including foreign markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements iii expanding our online auctions and vehicle remarketing service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets and to new sellers within the vehicle market in addition to maximize gross sales proceeds and cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities we introduce our i pricing structure ii selling processes iii operational procedures iv management information systems and v when appropriate redeploy existing personnel 

as part of our overall expansion strategy our objective is to increase our revenues operating profits and market share in the vehicle sales industry to implement our growth strategy we intend to continue to do the following 

acquire and develop new vehicle storage facilities in key markets including foreign markets 

our strategy is to offer integrated services to vehicle sellers on a national or regional basis by acquiring or developing facilities in new and existing markets we integrate our new acquisitions into our global network and capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from among other things the reduction of duplicative overhead and the implementation of our operating procedures 

pursue national and regional vehicle supply agreements 

our broad national presence enhances our ability to enter into local regional or national supply agreements with vehicle sellers we actively seek to establish national and regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities by utilizing our existing insurance 

company seller relationships we are able to build new seller relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets 

expand our service offerings to sellers and members 

over the past several years we have expanded our available service offerings to vehicle sellers and members the primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize returns to our sellers and maximize product value to our members this includes for our sellers realtime access to sales data over the internet national coverage the ability to respond on a national scale and for our members the implementation of vb3 realtime bidding at all of our facilities permitting members at any location worldwide to participate in the sales at all of our yards we plan to continue to refine and expand our services including offering software that can assist our sellers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that help sellers integrate their systems with ours 

our competitive advantages

      valueadded services

      6 

   proven ability to acquire and integrate acquisitions 

we have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating vehicle storage facilities since becoming a public company in 1994 we have completed acquisitions of facilities in north america the uk the uae brazil germany and spain as part of our acquisition and integration strategy we seek to 

    we strive to integrate all new facilities when appropriate into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle sellers we work with new sellers to implement our fee structures and new service programs we typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain knowledge about and respond to the local market we also assign a special integration team to help convert newly acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary software systems enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and sales systems 

technology to enhance and expand our business 

we have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering our proprietary software programs provide vehicle sellers with online access to data and reports regarding their vehicles being processed at any of our facilities this technology allows vehicle sellers to monitor each stage of our vehicle sales process from pick up to sale and settlement by the buyer our full range of internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process and minimizes the administrative and processing costs for us as well as our sellers we believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients resulting in high client retention and allow us to expand our national supply contracts

endoflife vehicle processing 

in the uk we are an authorized treatment facility for the disposal of endoflife vehicles 

virtual insured exchange vix 

we provide the venue for insurance customers to enter a vehicle into a sealed bid sale to establish its true value thereby allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles 

transportation services 

we maintain contracts with thirdparty vehicle transport companies which enable us to pick up most of our sellers’ vehicles within 24 hours our national network and transportation capabilities provide cost and time savings to our vehicle sellers and ensure ontime vehicle pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters in north america in the uk we perform transportation services through a combination of our fleet of over 150 vehicles and thirdparty vehicle transport companies 

vehicle inspection stations 

we offer some of our major insurance company sellers office and yard space to house vehicle inspection stations onsite at our facilities we have over 90 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities an onsite vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company sellers with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles which reduces storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility 

ondemand reporting 

we provide vehicle sellers with real time data for vehicles that we process for the particular seller this includes vehicle sellers’ gross and net returns on each vehicle service charges and other data that enable our vehicle sellers to more easily administer and monitor the vehicle disposition process in addition we have developed a database containing over 240 fields of realtime and historical information accessible by our sellers allowing for their generation of custom ad hoc reports and customer specific analysis 

dmv processing 

we have extensive expertise in dmv document and title processing for salvage vehicles we have developed a computer system which provides a direct link to the dmv computer systems of several states allowing us to expedite the processing of vehicle title paperwork 

flexible vehicle processing programs 

at the election of the seller we sell vehicles pursuant to our percentage incentive program pip consignment program or purchase program 

percentage incentive program our percentage incentive program is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle sellers under pip we agree to sell all of the vehicles of a seller in a specified market usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price because our revenues under pip are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return we provide the vehicle seller at our expense with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility as well as dmv document and title processing in addition we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather washing vehicle exteriors vacuuming vehicle interiors cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires making keys for drivable vehicles and identifying drivable vehicles we believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of the vehicles thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle sellers and us 

consignment program under our consignment program we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs 

purchase program under the purchase program we purchase vehicles from a vehicle seller at a formula price based on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated preaccident value pav or actual cash value acv and sell the vehicles for our own account currently the purchase program is offered primarily in the uk 

buy it now 

we offer an option to our members to purchase specific prequalified vehicles immediately at a set price before the live auction process this enables us to provide a fast easy transparent and comprehensive buying option on these prequalified vehicles 

member network 

we maintain a database of thousands of members in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair licensee used vehicle dealer and export industries as well as the general public as we sell directly to the general public at certain locations our database includes each member’s vehicle preference and purchasing history this data enables us to notify prospective buyers throughout the world via email of vehicles available for bidding that match their vehicle preferences listings of vehicles to be sold on a particular day and location are also made available on the internet 

sales process 

we offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles utilizing vb3 vb3 opens our sales process to registered members anywhere in the world who have internet access the vb3 technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb3 system lets a member see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay ®  members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb3’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf during all steps of the auction preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the highest preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time and then bid4u submits bids for the highest preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

copart dealer services 

we provide franchise and independent dealers with a convenient method to sell their tradeins through any of our facilities we have a dedicated group of employees in north america that target these dealers and work with them throughout the sales process

sales 

we process vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle sellers no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenues for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 we obtained 81 of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2014 and 82 for fiscal 2013 and 2012 from insurance company sellers our arrangements with our sellers are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle sellers the agreements are customized to each vehicle seller’s particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle seller in a designated geographic area 

we market our services to vehicle sellers through an inhouse sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques including targeted mailing of our sales literature telemarketing followup personal sales calls internet search engines employee referrals tow shop referrals participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions we market our services to franchise and independent dealerships as well as the general public under copartdirect we may when appropriate provide vehicle sellers with detailed analysis of the net return on vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses 

during the last three years a majority of our revenue was generated within north america and a majority of our longlived assets are located within the united states please see note 13 — segments and other geographic information in our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the geographic location of our sales and our longlived assets 

members 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered members in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair licensee used vehicle dealer and export industries we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing members with a variety of programs and services to become a registered member and gain admission to one of our sales prospective members must first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee provide requested personal and business information and have in most states a vehicle dismantler’s dealer’s resale repair or export license in certain venues we may sell to the general public registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements however nonregistered buyers may transact business at any of our sales via a 

registered broker who meets the local licensing and permitting requirements a member may also bring guests to a facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale we market to members on the internet and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in north america include kar auction services inc formerly adesa inc and insurance auto auctions inc auction broadcasting company llc and manheim inc the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation inc lkq lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group llc may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in the uk our principal competitors are privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business operating software that we developed to track salvage sales vehicles throughout the sales process we have implemented our proprietary business operating software at the majority of our storage facilities in addition we have integrated our mainframe computer system with internet and intranet systems in order to provide secure access to our data and images in a variety of formats 

our auctionstyle service product vb3 is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required 

we have invested in a production data center that is designed to run the business in the event of an emergency the facility’s electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored this facility is located in an area considered to be free of weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place as a result we recognized a charge of 291 million resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies 

employees 

as of july 31 2014 we had 4179 fulltime employees of whom 1225 were engaged in general and administrative functions and 2954 were engaged in yard operations we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good employees per geographic region are as follows 

 11 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oils and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination certain of our facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in aboveground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be disposed of as nonhazardous or hazardous waste as appropriate we have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities and we have initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional capital expenditures 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and international motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in june 2003 we filed a provisional us patent application on vb 2 in the united states this provisional patent application was followed by a us utility application filed in july 2003 the patent was issued by the united states patent and trademark office on january 1 2008 generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application in fiscal 2004 we received a patent from australia the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weatherrelated accidents

  risk factors tableend investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial 

materialized the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for fiscal 2014 historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues seller arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days’ notice vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside north america including recent expansions in europe brazil and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired outside of north america into our operations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside north america in 2007 with a significant acquisition in the united kingdom the uk and we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside north america in august 2012 we announced our acquisition of a company in the united arab emirates the uae in november 2012 we announced our acquisitions of companies in brazil and germany and in june 2013 we announced our acquisition of a company in spain acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside north america pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in international markets among other things we will ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology and financial and administrative functions may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

      as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the competition and markets authority uk regulator if an inquiry is made by the uk regulator we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulator will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry if the uk regulator determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulator the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not until our acquisition been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa uk bribery act brazil clean companies act or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the north american market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in north america 

some of our target markets outside north america operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in north america for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in north america in which we act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in north america and the uk has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside north america and the uk we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

in general acquisitions increase our sales and profitability although given the typical size of our acquisitions most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on consolidated results of operations and financial position we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts as a result the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations during this period the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions while profitable may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and accordingly have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position hence the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted 

we are transitioning various functionality of our thirdparty enterprise operating system to an internally developed proprietary system and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we work to develop design and stabilize this system 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place the transition of our enterprise operating system carries certain risks including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions delays or deficiencies which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb3 which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we may also implement further and enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be timeconsuming and expensive increase management responsibilities and divert management attention any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period could materially and adversely affect our business even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope domestically and internationally we must continue to provide reliable realtime access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products services features and functionality the transition to our new internal proprietary system will require us to commit substantial financial operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases without assurance that the volume of business will increase consumers will not tolerate a service hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service levels or insufficient capacity any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the impairment of capitalized development costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position during fiscal 2014 we recognized a 291 million impairment charge primarily related to capitalized software development costs as we ceased development of a thirdparty enterprise operating system and decided to address our international technology needs through an internally developed proprietary solution 

a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

information security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious code phishing attacks or information security breaches 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control we routinely are subject to cyberthreats and our technologies systems and networks have been subject to cyberattacks and we believe we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our consolidated operating results or financial position we have experienced incidents relating to cyberattacks in which unauthorized parties attempted to access and disrupt our online commerce these cyberattacks have caused minor service interruptions which were promptly addressed and resolved and our online service was restored to normal business however if one or more of these events continue to occur it could lead to security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services which could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromises this could cause service interruptions malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers such as 

the lack of availability of our valueadded systems as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties continuous cyberattacks could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market additional costs such as repairing systems adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs regulatory penalties financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded 

we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions including but not limited to usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes if these systems are compromised become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position in addition as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 

consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data furthermore our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption 

we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future under current credit card practices and the rules of the online auto auction industry we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers as such we have implemented certain antifraud measures including credit card verification procedures however a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance insufficiency or defective design additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in north america and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales 

we implemented our online system across all of our north american and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in both markets in considering new markets we consider the potential 

synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in north america and the uk we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita and sandy had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the united states we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2013 we acquired new facilities in sao paulo brazil the uae ettlingen germany cordoba spain and in north america furthermore promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

      in addition certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

     our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

                   19 

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions recent us supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our north american and brazilian storage facilities we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation 

infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate 192 of our common stock as of july 31 2014 if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer vincent w mitz our president and william e franklin our executive vice president united states and chief financial officer or if one or more of these executives decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

our cash investments are subject to numerous risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing in particular the online commerce is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete our future success will depend on our ability to 

   developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites transactionprocessing systems and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public may involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these 

sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2013 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricanes katrina rita and sandy weather events have had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the us these additional costs were characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory and included the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices and declines in used car prices may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts or pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws affecting the importation of salvage vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of salvage vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of salvage vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for salvage vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the us the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or is volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations in recent periods the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets has increased substantially principally as a result of a series of acquisitions we have made in north america the uk brazil germany the uae and spain in fiscal 2013 and 2014 as of july 31 2014 the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was 2838 million 

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in the definition of a business segment in which we operate changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations changes in competition or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization changes in these factors or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance could affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets which may result in an impairment charge for example continued deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required with respect to our acquisitions in north america the uk brazil germany the uae or spain we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets should the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

an adverse outcome of a pending georgia sales tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

the georgia department of revenue or dor conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of the audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to remit sales taxes totaling 738 million including penalties and interest in issuing the notice of proposed assessment the 

dor stated its policy position that sales for resale to nonus registered resellers are subject to georgia sales and use tax 

we have engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel has provided us with an opinion that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm and advice from outside tax advisors we believe that we have adequately provided for the payment of this assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the dor’s notice of proposed assessment and intend to defend this matter we have filed a request for protest or administrative appeal with the state of georgia there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the georgia dor we understand that georgia law and dor regulations are ambiguous on many of the points at issue in the audit and litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar uae dirham brazilian real and the euro could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with our credit facility prove ineffective it could result in volatility in our operating results including potential losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payment commitments for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan the notional amount of the two derivative transactions amortizes 188 million per quarter until september 30 2015 and 2000 million on december 14 2015 the first swap agreement fixed our interest rate with respect to a notional amount of 2375 million of our term loan at 85 basis points plus the applicable rate as outlined in our credit facility agreement the second 

swap agreement fixed our interest rate with respect to a notional amount of 563 million of our term loan at 69 basis points plus the applicable rate as outlined in our credit facility agreement the applicable rate on our credit facility can fluctuate between 15 and 20 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility and at july 31 2014 was 15 

we recorded the swaps at fair value and are currently designated as an effective cash flow hedge under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  each quarter we measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method” and record in earnings any gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness the hedge provided by our swaps could prove to be ineffective for a number of reasons including early retirement of the term loan as is allowed under the credit facility or in the event the counterparty to the interest rate swaps are determined in the future to not be creditworthy any determination that the hedge created by the swaps is ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and result in volatility in our operating results in addition any changes in relevant accounting standards relating to the swaps especially asc 815 derivatives and hedging  could materially increase earnings volatility

  legal proceedings tableend legal proceedings 

we are subject to threats of litigation and are involved in actual litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage and handling or disposal of vehicles the material pending legal proceedings to which we are party to or of which our property is subject to include the following matters 

on november 1 2013 we filed suit against sparta consulting inc now known as “kpit” in the 44th judicial district court of dallas county texas alleging fraud fraudulent inducement andor promissory fraud negligent misrepresentation unfair business practices pursuant to california business and professions code § 17200 breach of contract declaratory judgment and attorney’s fees we seek compensatory and exemplary damages disgorgement of amounts paid attorney’s fees pre and postjudgment interest costs of suit and a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights duties and obligations under the implementation services agreement dated october 6 2011 the suit arises out of our september 17 2013 decision to terminate the implementation services agreement under which kpit was to design implement and deliver a customized replacement enterprise resource planning system for us on january 2 2014 kpit removed this suit to the united states district court for the northern district of texas on august 11 2014 the northern district of texas transferred the suit to the united states district court for the eastern district of california for convenience on january 8 2014 kpit filed suit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of california alleging breach of contract promissory estoppel breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing account stated quantum meruit unjust enrichment and declaratory relief kpit 

seeks compensatory and exemplary damages prejudgment interest costs of suit and a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights duties and obligations under the implementation services agreement we are zealously pursuing our claim for damages and vigorously defending kpit’s claim for damages 

in connection with our response to hurricane sandy we entered into various shortterm leaselicense agreements with certain land owners in new york and new jersey to marshal and store storm damaged vehicles until they were sold in november and december 2012 various actions were commenced against us and land owners in new york actions were brought by the town of southampton the county of suffolk the town of brookhaven and the new york state department of environmental conservation the dec seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as civil penalties in connection with alleged violations of local zoning land use and environmental regulations the claims by the various plaintiffs have been mitigated with the removal of vehicles from the various shortterm storage locations in new york the claims brought by the dec have all been resolved through entering into consent orders which included administrative payments in amounts that are not material to us and restoration of premises which we are undertaking we are defending the remaining new york claim and believe we have bona fide legal defenses 

we have provided for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when the insurance is purchased 

governmental proceedings 

the georgia department of revenue or dor conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of the audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to remit sales taxes totaling 738 million including penalties and interest in issuing the notice of proposed assessment the dor stated its policy position that sales for resale to nonus registered resellers are subject to georgia sales and use tax 

we have engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel has provided us an opinion that the sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm and advice from outside tax advisors we have adequately provided for the payment of a possible assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the dor’s notice of proposed assessment and intend to defend this matter we have filed a request for protest or administrative appeal with the state of georgia there can be no assurance that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the georgia dor we understand that georgia law and dor regulations are ambiguous on many of the points at issue in the audit and litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to 

be resolved in a manner adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk and brazil we also provide vehicle remarketing services in the united arab emirates uae germany and spain 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb3 vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us and canada north america brazil and the uae we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account and as an agent in germany and spain we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance such indicators include 

service and vehicle sales revenue our revenue consists of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs included in the consignment fee under the consignment program only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk we have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 

our revenue is impacted by changes in salvage frequency salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents which insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repairs costs used car values and auction returns over the last several years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in salvage frequency the increase in salvage frequency may have been driven by the decline in used car values relative to repair costs conversely increases in used car prices such as occurred during the most recent recession may decrease salvage frequency and adversely affect our growth rate used car values are determined by many factors including the used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the average age of cars on the road new cars sales grew on a year over year basis increasing the supply of used cars additionally the average age of cars on the road continued to increase growing from 96 years in 2002 to 114 years in 2014 these factors among others have led to a general decline in used car values while repair costs are generally trending upward the factors that influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in salvage frequency 

operating costs and expenses yard operations consists primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

other income and expense other income primarily includes income from the rental of certain real property foreign exchange rate gains and losses and gains and losses from the disposal of assets which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period other expense consists primarily of interest expense on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt 

liquidity and cash flows our primary source of working capital is cash operating results the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents the primary factors affecting cash operating results are i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v salvage frequency vi increased volume from our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity however we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and if available if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 

acquisitions and new operations 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america the uk the uae germany spain and brazil and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2011 through july 31 2014 

 

 the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it is our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets 

ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii increasing our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb3 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary 

results of operations 

the following table shows certain data from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 

 comparison of fiscal years ended july 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

the following table presents a comparison of service revenues and vehicle sales for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 

 service revenues the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2014 of 1087 million or 128 as compared to fiscal 2013 came from i growth in north america of 767 million ii growth in the uk of 237 million driven by increased volume from our vehicle suppliers and iii our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into germany spain the uae and brazil which represented 83 million excluding the increase in revenues in fiscal 2013 associated with hurricane sandy of 312 million north america service revenue grew by 1079 million or 147 the growth in north america was driven primarily by increased volume as revenue per car remained relatively flat the increase in volume came from the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and increases from existing suppliers as we believe there has been an increase in the overall growth in the salvage market driven by increased salvage frequency 

the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2013 of 924 million or 122 as compared to fiscal 2012 came from growth from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the uae and brazil which represented 101 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed on may 30 2013 and represented 80 million iii growth in the uk of 29 million driven by increased revenue per car and iv growth in north america of 714 million the growth in north america was driven primarily by increased volume as revenue per car remained relatively flat the increase in volume came from i hurricane sandy as the major storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles ii increased volumes from the full year impact of an exclusive provider contract entered into with a major insurance company at the end of fiscal 2012 and iii what we believe to be a general increase in the overall salvage market as we believe there has been an increase in salvage frequency 

vehicle sales the increase in vehicle sales for fiscal 2014 of 84 million or 42 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily came from i our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into germany spain the uae and brazil which represented 48 million ii growth in the uk of 23 million driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity from the general public and iii growth in north america of 13 million driven primarily by the acquisition of salvage parent inc 

the increase in vehicle sales for fiscal 2013 of 298 million or 179 as compared to fiscal 2012 resulted from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the uae and brazil which represented 11 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which represented 32 million iii growth in the uk of 136 million driven primarily by increased volume from insurance sellers and increased open market purchase activity from the general public and iv growth in the north america of 119 million driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity 

the following table summarizes operating expenses total other expenses and income taxes for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 

 yard operations expense the increase in yard operations expense for fiscal 2014 of 622 million or 136 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily came from i growth in north america driven by the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed in the fourth quarter of the fiscal 2013 increased volume from what we believe to be an increase in the overall size of the salvage market due to increased salvage frequency and increases in volume from noninsurance suppliers ii growth in the uk driven by increased volumes from our new and existing suppliers and iii growth in our international activity outside of the uk as these operations are in their developmental stages without the benefit of scale included in our yard operations expense in fiscal 2013 was 257 million of abnormal costs associated with hurricane sandy excluding those costs the average handling cost per car increased driven primarily by growth in normal subhaul labor equipment and titling costs as well as charges associated with severance and lease termination costs of 29 million primarily associated with the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition 

included in yard operations cost was depreciation and amortization expenses which were 362 million 408 million and 330 million for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2014 was due primarily to our data center assets being fully 

depreciated the increase in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2013 was due primarily to accelerated depreciation from the shorter useful lives of our data center assets 

the increase in yard operations expense for fiscal 2013 of 806 million or 214 as compared to fiscal 2012 was due to the growth from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the uae and brazil which represented 54 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which represented 64 million iii growth in the uk of 16 million driven by increased volume associated with general salvage market growth and iv growth in north america of 595 million the growth in north america was driven by increases in both the costs to process each car and in volume which were 317 million and 278 million respectively the increase in volume came from i hurricane sandy as the major storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles ii increased volumes from the full year impact of an exclusive provider contract entered into with a major insurance company at the end of fiscal 2012 and iii what we believe to be a general increase the in overall salvage market as we believe there has been an increase in salvage frequency which is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that the insurance companies salvage rather than repair the increase in the cost to process each car was driven primarily by the abnormal costs for temporary storage facilities premiums for subhaulers labor costs incurred from overtime travel and lodging and equipment associated with hurricane sandy there was also an increase in the normal cost to process each car driven by growth in normal subhaul labor equipment and titling costs 

cost of vehicle sales  the increase in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2014 of 73 million or 43 as compared to fiscal 2013 came from i our international expansion during the prior fiscal year which represented 48 million ii growth in the uk of 21 million driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity from the general public and iii growth in north america of 03 million driven primarily by the acquisition of salvage parent inc 

the increase in cost of vehicle sales for fiscal 2013 of 303 million or 221 as compared to fiscal 2012 came from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the uae and brazil which represented 11 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which represented 29 million and iii growth in the uk and north america of 262 million and driven primarily by increased volume from insurance sellers in the uk and increased open market purchase activity from the general public in both the uk and north america 

general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 of 266 million or 193 as compared to fiscal 2013 increased primarily from i our international expansion during the prior fiscal year into germany spain the uae and brazil representing 37 million and ii growth in north america of 196 million driven primarily by the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 increased expenditures on technology development and the overall growth in labor costs professional services and facilities costs associated with domestic and international expansion included in fiscal 2014 was 75 million in lease termination severance and relocation costs associated with the integration of the salvage parent inc acquisition and the relocation of our technology department from california to our dallas texas corporate headquarters 

included in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 175 million 160 million and 151 million for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 of 234 million or 205 as compared to fiscal 2012 is a result of growth from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the uae and brazil representing 53 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed on may 30 2013 and represents 28 million iii relocation costs of 17 million and iv growth in north america of 128 million the growth in north america was driven primarily by increased costs associated with new product development the configuration of a new worldwide erp operating platform and the transition costs associated with the outsourcing of our it infrastructure and support which totaled 108 million as well as an overall growth in labor costs professional services and facilities costs associated with domestic and international expansion 

impairment during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place as a result we recognized a charge of 291 million resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software 

other expense income the decrease in total other expense for fiscal 2014 of 12 million or 200 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of principal payments on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt  

the decrease in total other expense for fiscal 2013 of 22 million or 262 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of principal payments on longterm debt partially offset by a gain on sale of assets 

income taxes our effective income tax rates were 338 350 and 345 for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the change in the overall tax rate was driven by fluctuations in the us tax laws and the geographical allocation of our taxable income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents a comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

 working capital and cash and cash equivalents increased for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to cash generated from operations partially offset by decreases in capital expenditures payments on longterm debt and cash used in acquisitions cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at variable rates cash and cash equivalents decreased for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to increases of capital expenditures and acquisitions as well as payments on longterm debt partially offset by a reduction in share repurchase activity proceeds from stock option exercises and increased accounts payable balances 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees members’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair during the winter months most of our facilities process 

10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that i is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity ii has adequate size given the capacity needs iii has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations iv is reasonably close to a major road or highway and v most importantly has the appropriate zoning for our business costs to develop a new yard generally range from 10 to 130 million depending on size location and developmental infrastructure requirements 

as of july 31 2014 570 million of the 1587 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

net cash provided by operating activities increased for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to improved cash operating results from an increase in revenue and changes in operating assets and liabilities the change in operating assets and liabilities was related to the lower growth in accounts receivables of 183 million primarily due to the prior year effect of hurricane sandy a decrease in prepaid and other assets of 113 million offset by an increase in accounts payable of 93 million 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increases in prepaid and other assets of 288 million accounts receivable of 152 million and income taxes receivable of 78 million partially offset by increases in accounts payable of 186 million the remaining decrease of 28 million was due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

net cash used in investing activities decreased for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to significant land acquisitions during fiscal 2013 related to our first facilities in brazil and germany and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities software development and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations we have no material noncancelable commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2014 included in capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software the capitalized costs were 165 million 193 million and 82 million for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired during fiscal 2014 we recognized a charge of 291 million resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of business operating software see notes to consolidated financial statements capitalized software costs in note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies 

net cash used in investing activities increased for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to increases in capital expenditures including significant land acquisitions related to our first facilities in brazil and germany lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities software development and acquiring yard equipment acquisition related capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 were 840 million primarily for the acquisition of salvage parent inc and acquisitions for international expansion 

net cash used in financing activities increased for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 predominantly due to a 163 million change in bank overdraft decreased proceeds of 110 million from the exercise of stock options a 144 million decrease in common stock repurchases and a 38 million reduction in tax 

benefits from stockbased payment compensation partially offset by a 217 million decrease in payments on longterm debt see notes to consolidated financial statements note 10 — stockholders’ equity  

on september 22 2011 our board of directors approved a 40 million share increase in the stock repurchase program that was originally implemented in 2003 bringing the total current authorization to 98 million shares the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions no time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program subject to applicable securities laws such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time for fiscal 2014 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock for fiscal 2013 we repurchased 500000 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 2777 for fiscal 2012 we repurchased 8880708 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 2251 as of july 31 2014 the total number of shares repurchased under the program was 50286782 and 47713218 shares were available for repurchase under our program 

net cash used in financing activities decreased for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to a 1883 million decrease in common stock repurchases a 163 million change in bank overdraft and increased proceeds of 78 million from the exercise of stock options partially offset by a 1250 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and a 404 million increase in payments on longterm debt 

in the first second and third quarters of fiscal 2012 and the second quarter of fiscal 2013 certain executives exercised stock options through cashless exercises in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 certain employees exercised stock options through cashless exercises a portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price and federal and state minimum statutory tax withholding requirements we remitted 01 million 06 million and 26 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees’ minimum statutory withholding requirements 

the exercised stock options are summarized in the following table 

 

 42 

contractual obligations 

we lease certain domestic and foreign facilities and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases in addition to the minimum future lease commitments presented the leases generally require us to pay property taxes insurance maintenance and repair costs which are not included in the table because we have determined these items are not material the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july 31 2014 

 

 

   credit facility 

on december 14 2010 we entered into an amended and restated credit facility agreement credit facility which superseded our previously disclosed credit agreement with bank of america na bank of america the credit facility is an unsecured credit agreement providing for i a 1000 million revolving credit facility including a 1000 million alternative currency borrowing sublimit and a 500 million letter of credit sublimit revolving credit and ii a term loan facility of 4000 million term loan on january 14 2011 the full 4000 million provided under the term loan was borrowed on september 29 2011 we amended the credit facility increasing the amount of the term loan from 4000 million to 5000 million on march 1 2013 we amended the credit facility to increase the net leverage ratio at which restrictive spending covenants are introduced from 11 to 151 

the term loan which at july 31 2014 had 2938 million outstanding amortizes 188 million each quarter beginning december 31 2011 with all outstanding borrowings due on december 14 2015 all amounts borrowed under the term loan may be prepaid without premium or penalty during fiscal 2014 we made principal repayments of 750 million we currently have 07 million of deferred financing costs in other assets as of july 31 2014 

amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest subject to certain restrictions at a fluctuating rate based on i the eurocurrency rate ii the federal funds rate or iii the prime rate as described in the credit facility we have entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan balance see notes to consolidated financial statements note 9 — derivatives and hedging a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to 20 above the otherwise applicable interest rate our interest rate as of july 31 2014 was the 015 eurocurrency rate plus the 15 applicable rate the applicable rate can fluctuate between 15 and 20 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility the credit facility is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries the carrying amount of the credit facility is comprised of borrowings under which interest accrues under a fluctuating interest rate structure accordingly the carrying value approximates fair value as of july 31 2014 and was classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy 

amounts borrowed under the revolving credit may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date of december 14 2015 the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit the commitment fee ranges from 0075 to 0125 per annum depending on our leverage ratio we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit at july 31 2014 

the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and may place certain business operating restrictions on us relating to among other things indebtedness liens and other encumbrances investments mergers and acquisitions asset sales dividends and distributions and redemptions of capital stock in addition the credit facility provides for the following financial covenants i earnings before interest income tax depreciation and amortization ebitda ii leverage ratio iii interest coverage ratio and iv limitations on capital expenditures the credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees violation of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties crossdefaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency defaults material judgments invalidity of the loan documents and events constituting a change of control we were in compliance with all covenants as of july 31 2014 

restructuring

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2014 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements pursuant to item 303a4 of regulation sk promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including costs related to vehicle pooling selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition stockbased payment compensation purchase price allocations longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we discuss where appropriate sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item i “financial statements” 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current north american contracts collecting the proceeds from the member presale services including towing title processing preparation and storage as well as sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service net of applicable rebates or allowances for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle the revenue associated with the presale services is recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and determinable the selling price of each service is determined based on management’s best estimate and is allotted based on the relative selling price method 

vehicle sales where vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf are recognized on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multipleelement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting 

the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees 

which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services 

we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in us gaap in accordance with asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

 the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values for fiscal 2014 and 2013 due to the shortterm nature of those instruments and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments see notes to consolidated financial statements note 8 — longterm debt for additional fair value disclosures 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation for an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “abnormal” as 

provided in the guidance in addition the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

in early november 2012 hurricane sandy hit the northeastern coast of the united states as a result of the extensive flooding that it caused we expended additional costs for i temporary storage facilities ii premiums for subhaulers as they were reassigned from other regions and iii labor costs incurred for overtime travel and lodging due to the reassignment of employees to the affected region these costs which are characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory  were expensed as incurred and not included in inventory as of july 31 2013 the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of hurricane sandy were sold 

derivatives and hedging 

we have entered into two interest rate swaps to eliminate interest rate risk on our variable rate term loan and the swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  see notes to consolidated financial statements note 9 — derivatives and hedging  each quarter we measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method” and record in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness with the effective portion of the hedges’ change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income or loss 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life generally three years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets total gross capitalized software as of july 31 2014 and 2013 was 617 million and 743 million respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software as of july 31 2014 and 2013 totaled 386 million and 286 million respectively 

during fiscal 2014 we terminated a contract with kpit formerly known as sparta consulting inc whereby kpit was engaged to design and implement an sapbased replacement for our existing business operating software that among other things would address our international expansion needs following a review of kpit’s work performed to date and an assessment of the cost to complete deployment risk and other factors we ceased development of kpit’s software and are now pursuing an internally developed proprietary solution in its place as a result we recognized a charge of 291 million resulting primarily from the impairment of costs previously capitalized in connection with the development of the software 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total 

accounts receivable balance a one percentage point adverse change to the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of 17 million 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada the uk brazil spain and germany in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate then we analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2014 we have 22 million of valuation allowance arising from both our us and foreign operations to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 

based on our results for the twelve months ended july 31 2014 a one percentage adverse change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase in the income tax expense of 27 million 

we apply the provision of asc 740 income taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement 

although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes including the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing 

authorities including the internal revenue service and us states we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

stockbased payment compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method compensation cost related to stockbased payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes merton option pricing model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000 deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which has a 225000 stop loss per claim and a stop loss limiting total exposure to 120 of expected claims in addition each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss to limit our ultimate exposure our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue historically our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies is 57 million as of july 31 2014 if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our annual medical expense would change by 15 million and our accrual for medical expenses would change by 04 million if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our annual workers’ compensation expense and our accrual for workers’ compensation expenses would change by less than 02 million a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by an insignificant amount 

accounting for acquisitions 

we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquired entities in accordance with asc 805 business combinations  the accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates including the fair value of acquired intangible assets which involve projections of future revenues cash flows and terminal value which are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate and the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities including potential contingencies and the useful lives of the assets the projections are developed using internal forecasts available industry and market data and estimates of longterm growth rates of our business historical experience is additionally utilized in which historical or current costs have approximated fair value for certain assets acquired 

segment reporting 

our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics

 item 7a 

  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets all cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as of july 31 2014 as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2014 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held for fiscal 2014 a hypothetical 10 adverse change in our interest yield would not have materially affected our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the credit facility were 2938 million as of july 31 2014 amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest subject to certain restrictions at a fluctuating rate based on i the eurocurrency rate ii the federal funds rate or iii the prime rate as described in the credit facility a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to 20 above the otherwise applicable interest rate if interest rates were to increase by 10 our interest expense would increase but by an insignificant amount due to the fixed interest rate swaps we have entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan balance to mitigate the interest expense risk 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues are typically denominated in the local currency of each country and result from transactions by our operations in canada the uk the uae brazil spain and germany these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar the british pound the uae dirham the brazilian real and the euro our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility which could have a material and adverse impact on our future results a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham brazilian real and euro would have resulted in an increase to revenue of 263 million for fiscal 2014 

fluctuations in foreign currencies also create volatility in our consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2014 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of 190 million this loss was recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar 

british pound uae dirham brazilian real and euro would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion copart inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2014 based on the coso criteria

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

  risk factors tableend investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialized the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during the fiscal year ended july 31 2013 historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues seller arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside north america including recent expansions in europe brazil and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired outside of north america into our operations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside north america in 2007 with a significant acquisition in the united kingdom the uk and we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside north america in august 2012 we announced our acquisition of a company in the united arab emirates the uae in november 2012 we announced our acquisitions of companies in brazil and germany and in june 2013 we announced our acquisition of a company in spain acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside north america pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in international markets among other things we will ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful 

or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology integration and integration of financial and administrative functions may not proceed as we anticipate and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses including unanticipated capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

      as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition certain acquisitions in the uk may be reviewed by the office of fair trade oft andor competition commission uk regulators if an inquiry is made by uk regulators we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulators will agree with us if they decide to make an inquiry if the uk regulators determine that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulators the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

our operations and acquisitions in certain foreign areas expose us to political regulatory economic and reputational risks 

although we have implemented policies procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with antibribery laws trade controls and economic sanctions and similar regulations our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

in addition some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate nonus companies which had not until our acquisition been subject to us law in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the north american market for example certain markets operate on a principal rather than agent basis which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks that we do not experience in north america 

some of our target markets outside north america operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in north america for example new markets may operate either wholly or partially on the principal model in which the vehicle is purchased then resold for our own account rather than the agency model employed in north america in which we act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles consequently new acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our consolidated gross margin percentages further operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in north america and the united kingdom has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside north america and the uk we cannot predict whether markets will readily adopt our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning erp system is not executed efficiently and effectively our business financial position and our consolidated operating results could be adversely affected 

we are in the process of converting our primary management information system to a new standard erp system which will occur in phases through 2014 and 2015 in the event this conversion of our primary management information system is not executed efficiently and effectively the conversion may cause interruptions in our primary management information systems which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb 2  which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

in addition our information and technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses network failures computer and telecommunications failures infiltration by unauthorized persons and security breaches usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes although we have not been the victim of cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our consolidated operating results or financial position we have from time to time experienced cyber security breaches such as computer viruses and similar 

information technology violations in the ordinary course of business we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions if these systems are compromised become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in north america and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales we implemented our online system across all of our north american and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in both markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in north america and the uk we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina rita and sandy had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the gulf coast area and in the northeastern coast of the united states respectively we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities for example in fiscal 2013 we acquired five new facilities in sao paulo brazil one facility in the uae one facility in ettlingen germany one facility in cordoba spain and 43 facilities in north america furthermore promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

   16 

  in addition certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

     our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

           17 

         due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our north american and brazilian storage facilities we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates further we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate 19 of our common stock as of july 31 2013 if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more 

difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer and vincent w mitz our president or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

our cash investments are subject to numerous risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

the impairment of capitalized development costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or rollout if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public may involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete 

more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during the fiscal year ended july 31 2006 and during fiscal year 2013 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in gulf coast states and hurricane sandy in the northeastern coast of the united states respectively these additional costs characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory and included the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices and declines in used car prices may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts or pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial position additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws affecting the importation of salvage vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of salvage vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of salvage vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for salvage vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the united states the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

adverse us and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the us and abroad as a result of any economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles increases in unemployment as a result of any economic downturn may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident which disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or remain volatile our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations in recent periods the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet has increased substantially principally as a result of a series of acquisitions we have made in north america brazil germany uae and spain in fiscal 2013 as of july 31 2013 the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was 2675 million 

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in the definition of a business segment in which we operate changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations changes in competition or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization changes in these factors or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance could affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets which may result in an impairment charge for example continued deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required with respect to our acquisitions in north america uk brazil germany uae or spain we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets should the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

an adverse outcome of a pending georgia sales tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

the georgia department of revenue or dor conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of the audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to remit sales taxes totaling 738 million including penalties and interest in issuing the notice of proposed assessment the 

dor stated its policy position that sales for resale to nonus registered resellers are subject to georgia sales and use tax 

we have engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel has provided us with an opinion that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm and advice from outside tax advisors we have adequately provided for the payment of this assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the dor’s notice of proposed assessment and intend to defend this matter we have filed a request for protest or administrative appeal with the state of georgia there can be no assurance however that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the georgia dor we understand that georgia law and dor regulations are ambiguous on many of the points at issue in the audit and litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements and consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound canadian dollar uae dirham brazilian real and the euro could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

if the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with our credit facility prove ineffective it could result in volatility in our operating results including potential losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payment commitments for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan the notional amount of the two derivative transactions amortizes 188 million per quarter until september 30 2015 and 200 million on december 14 2015 the first swap agreement fixed our interest rate with respect to a notional amount of 2875 million of our term loan at 85 basis points plus the applicable rate as outlined in our credit facility agreement the second 

swap agreement fixed our interest rate with respect to a notional amount of 813 million of our term loan at 69 basis points plus the applicable rate as outlined in our credit facility agreement the applicable rate on our credit facility can fluctuate between 15 and 20 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility and at july 31 2013 was 15 

we recorded the swaps at fair value and are currently designated as an effective cash flow hedge under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  each quarter we measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method” and record in earnings any gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness the hedge provided by our swaps could prove to be ineffective for a number of reasons including early retirement of the term loan as is allowed under the credit facility or in the event the counterparty to the interest rate swaps are determined in the future to not be creditworthy any determination that the hedge created by the swaps is ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and result in volatility in our operating results in addition any changes in relevant accounting standards relating to the swaps especially asc 815 derivatives and hedging  could materially increase earnings volatility

overview 

we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk and brazil we also provide vehicle remarketing service in the united arab emirates uae germany and spain 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb 2  vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us and canada north america the uae and brazil we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account and as an agent in germany and spain we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle 

regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program or pip where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs under the consignment programs only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles sold under purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

acquisitions and new operations 

we have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired 55 facilities and established four new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2011 through july 31 2013 all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america the uk the uae germany spain and brazil and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2010 through july 31 2013 

 31 

 

 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it is our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through business acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

revenues 

the following table sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands except percentages 

 service revenues service revenues were 8497 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 7573 million for fiscal 2012 an increase of 924 million or 122 above fiscal 2012 the growth came from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the united arab emirates and brazil which represented 101 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed on may 30 2013 and represents 80 million iii growth in the uk of 29 million driven by increased revenue per car and iv growth in north america of 714 million the growth in north america was driven primarily by increased volume as revenue per car remained relatively flat the increase in volume came from i hurricane sandy as the major storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles ii market share gains as we saw the full year impact of the exclusive provider contract entered into with a major insurance company at the end of fiscal 2012 and iii what we believe to be a general increase in the overall salvage market as we believe there has been an increase in salvage frequency salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair trends in salvage frequency are driven by the relationship between repairs costs used car values and auction returns the increase in salvage frequency was driven we believe by the decline in used cars values relative to repair costs used car values are determined by many factors including the used car supply which is tied directly to new car sales and the 

average age of cars on the road new cars sales grew on a year over year basis increasing the supply of used cars and the average age of a car on the road continued to grow these factors among others lead to a decline in used car values on a year over year basis during the same period the average cost to repair a car increased the factors that influence repair costs used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements accordingly we cannot predict future trends in salvage frequency 

vehicle sales we have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account we also purchase vehicles in the open market primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account vehicle sales revenues were 1967 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 1669 million for fiscal 2012 an increase of 298 million or 179 above fiscal 2012 the increase came from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the united arab emirates and brazil which represented 11 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which represented 32 million iii growth in the uk of 136 million and driven primarily by increased volume from insurance sellers in the uk and increased open market purchase activity from the general public and iv growth in north america of 119 million driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment were 4175 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 3446 million for fiscal 2012 an increase of 729 million or 212 above fiscal 2012 the growth came from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the united arab emirates and brazil which represented 54 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which represented 64 million iii growth in the uk of 16 million driven by increased volume associated with general salvage market growth and iv growth in north america of 595 million the growth in north america was driven by increases in both the costs to process each car and in volume 317 million and 278 million respectively the increase in volume came from i hurricane sandy as the major storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles ii market share gains as we saw the full year impact of the exclusive provider contract entered into with a major insurance company at the end of fiscal 2012 and iii what we believe to be a general increase the in overall salvage market as we believe there has been an increase in salvage frequency which is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that the insurance companies salvage rather than repair the increase in the cost to process each car was driven primarily by the abnormal costs for temporary storage facilities premiums for subhaulers labor costs incurred from overtime travel and lodging and equipment associated with hurricane sandy there was also an increase in the normal cost to process each car driven by growth in normal subhaul labor equipment and titling costs 

included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 408 million and 330 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense is due primarily to accelerated depreciation from the shorter useful lives of our data center assets 

cost of vehicle sales the cost of vehicles sold was 1672 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 1370 million for fiscal 2012 an increase of 302 million or 220 the increase came from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the united arab emirates and brazil which represented 11 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which represented 29 million and iii growth in the uk and north america of 262 million and driven primarily by increased volume from insurance sellers in the uk and increased open market purchase activity from the general public in both the uk and in north america 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment were 1220 million for fiscal 2013 compared to 994 million for fiscal 2012 an increase of 226 million or 227 the growth came from i our international expansion during the year into germany spain the united arab emirates and brazil representing 53 million ii the acquisition of salvage parent inc which closed on may 30 2013 and represents 28 million iii relocation costs of 17 million and iv growth in north america of 128 million the growth in north america was driven 

primarily by increased costs associated with new product development the rollout of a new worldwide erp operating platform and the transition costs associated with the outsourcing of our it infrastructure and support which totaled 108 million as well as an overall growth in labor costs professional services and facilities costs associated with domestic and international expansion 

included in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 160 million and 151 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

other expense income total other expense was 61 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 83 million during fiscal 2012 a decrease of 22 million or 265 interest expense decreased 11 million as a result of principal payments of longterm debt which is further described in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 9 longterm debt  which is incorporated herein by reference other income net increased 08 million due primarily to the gain on sale of assets 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2013 and 2012 were 350 and 345 respectively the change in the overall tax rate was driven by fluctuations in the us state taxes and the geographical allocation of our taxable income 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

revenues 

the following table sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands except percentages 

 service revenues service revenues were 7573 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 7131 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of 442 million or 62 above fiscal 2011 growth in unit volume generated 335 million in additional service revenue relative to last year and was driven primarily by growth in the number of units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and the migration from the principal model to the agency model in the uk growth in the average revenue per car sold generated 115 million in additional revenue over last year and was driven by an increase in the average vehicle auction selling price as over 50 of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle we believe the increase in the average vehicle auction selling price was driven primarily by i the year over year increase in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the general increase in used car pricing which we believe has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles which are repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user iii the mix of cars sold as the insurance company cars which on average command a lower average selling price than noninsurance cars represented a lower portion of all cars sold and iv in the uk the beneficial impact of vb 2 which we introduced in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide we cannot determine the impact of the movement of these influences as we cannot determine which vehicles are sold to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export nor can we predict their future movement accordingly we cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing used car pricing product sales mix and the introduction of vb 2 in the uk had on the selling price of vehicles and ultimately on service revenue the average dollar to pound exchange rate was 158 dollars to the pound and 160 dollars to the pound for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectively and led to a decrease in service revenue of 08 million 

vehicle sales we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 

vehicle sales revenues were 1669 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 1592 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of 77 million or 48 above fiscal 2011 the increase in vehicle sales revenue was due to the growth in the average selling price of vehicles which resulted in increased revenue of 202 million the growth in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to i the increase in commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling and ii in the uk the continuing beneficial impact of vb 2 which we introduced to the uk in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide we cannot determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the specific impact of commodity pricing nor can we isolate the impact that vb 2 had on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold in the uk the decline in volume resulted primarily from the migration of certain contracts in the uk from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of 111 million the detrimental impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate was 14 million 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment were 3446 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 3371 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of 75 million or 22 above fiscal 2011 the increase was driven by volume which led to an increase of 135 million as we processed more vehicles in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 this increase was offset by a reduction in operating costs of 55 million driven by the decline in the cost to process each car there was a detrimental impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate of 05 million 

included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 330 million and 370 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

cost of vehicle sales the cost of vehicles sold was 1370 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 1252 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of 118 million or 94 the increase in the cost per unit sold represented a 151 million increase relative to last year unit volume decrease led to a decrease of 23 million the beneficial impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate was 10 million 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were 994 million for fiscal 2012 compared to 989 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of less than 05 million or 05 the beneficial impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate was 01 million 

included in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 151 million and 87 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

impairment  during the year ended july 31 2012 we recorded an impairment of 88 million associated with the writedown to fair market value of certain assets primarily real estate computer hardware and our fleet of private aircraft which have been removed from operations and if not disposed of are reflected in assets held for sale on the balance sheet 

other expense income total other expense was 83 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 14 million during fiscal 2011 an increase of 69 million or 4929 interest expense increased 73 million as a result of increased borrowing under the new credit facility which is further described in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 9 longterm debt  which is incorporated herein by reference other income net increased 05 million due primarily to the gain on sale of assets 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2012 and 2011 were 345 and 369 respectively the change in tax rates was primarily driven by the geographical allocation of income and the application of new elective tax law starting in fiscal 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of working capital is net income accordingly factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital those primary factors i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v salvage frequency vi change in market share of our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchange rates x product mix and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate are discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10k 

potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity however with respect to the issuance of equity or debt we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and if available if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees members’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars deemed as totaled by the insurance companies during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

as of july 31 2013 we had working capital of 679 million including cash and cash equivalents of 636 million cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at a variable rate cash and cash equivalents decreased by 765 million from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 the decrease in cash was due primarily to the 2143 million for capital expenditures and acquisitions and 967 million in payments on outstanding debt which were offset by a reduction in share repurchase activity proceeds from stock option exercises and increased accounts payable balances 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 

as of july 31 2013 355 million of the 636 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 304 million to 1993 million during fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012 the decrease was driven in part by increases in prepaid and other assets of 288 million increased accounts receivable of 152 million and increased income taxes receivable of 78 million offset by increases in accounts payable of 186 million the remaining decrease of 28 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 133 million to 2297 million during fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease was driven in part by increased deferred income taxes of 155 million a 121 million increase in vehicle pooling costs as a result of the adoption of asu 200913 in fiscal 2011 offset by an increase in net income of 157 million the remaining decrease of 14 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

investing activities 

capital expenditures excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were 1303 million 548 million and 702 million for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities software development and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations acquisition related capital expenditures for the year ended july 31 2013 were 840 million primarily for the acquisition of salvage parent inc and acquisitions for international expansion we have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2013

credit facilities 

on december 14 2010 we entered into an amended and restated credit facility agreement credit facility which supersedes our previously disclosed credit agreement with bank of america na bank of america the credit facility is an unsecured credit agreement providing for i a 1000 million revolving credit facility including a 1000 million alternative currency borrowing sublimit and a 500 million letter of credit sublimit revolving credit and ii a term loan facility of 4000 million term loan on january 14 2011 the full 4000 million provided under the term loan was borrowed on september 29 2011 we amended the credit agreement increasing the amount of the term loan facility from 4000 million to 5000 million on march 1 2013 we amended the credit agreement to increase the net leverage ratio at which restrictive spending covenants are introduced from 11 to 151 

the term loan which at july 31 2013 had 3688 million outstanding amortizes 188 million each quarter beginning december 31 2011 with all outstanding borrowings due on december 14 2015 all amounts borrowed under the term loan may be prepaid without premium or penalty during the year ended july 31 2013 we made principal repayments of 750 million we currently have 12 million deferred financing costs in other assets as of july 31 2013 

amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest subject to certain restrictions at a fluctuating rate based on i the eurocurrency rate ii the federal funds rate or iii the prime rate as described in the credit facility we have entered into two interest rate swaps see note 10 derivatives and hedging  to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan balance which at july 31 2013 totaled 3688 million a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to 20 above the otherwise applicable interest rate at july 31 2013 our interest rate is the 020 eurocurrency rate plus the 15 applicable rate the applicable rate can fluctuate between 15 and 20 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility the credit facility is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries the carrying amount of the credit facility is comprised of borrowing under which interest accrues under a fluctuating interest rate structure accordingly the carrying value approximates fair value at july 31 2013 and is classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy 

amounts borrowed under the revolving credit may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date which is december 14 2015 the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit the commitment fee ranges from 0075 to 0125 per annum depending on our leverage ratio we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit at the end of the period 

the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and may place certain business operating restrictions on us relating to among other things indebtedness liens and other encumbrances investments mergers and acquisitions asset sales dividends and distributions and redemptions of capital stock in addition the credit facility provides for the following financial covenants i earnings before income tax depreciation and amortization ebitda ii leverage ratio iii interest coverage ratio and iv limitations on capital expenditures the credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees violation of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties crossdefaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency defaults material judgments invalidity of the loan documents and events constituting a change of control we are in compliance with all covenants as of july 31 2013 please refer to the tables under the caption “contractual obligations” above in the “longterm debt including current portion” section for the payment schedule 

restructuring 

we relocated our corporate headquarters to dallas texas in 2012 certain functions currently performed at the fairfield california location may transition to the corporate headquarters over the next few years we may incur additional expenses in future fiscal years 

the restructuringrelated costs are as follows in thousands 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2013 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of regulation sk promulgated under the exchange act 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to vehicle pooling costs selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we discuss where appropriate sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current north american contracts collecting the proceeds from the member presale services including towing title processing preparation and storage as well as sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service net of applicable rebates or allowances for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle the revenue associated with the presale services are recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and 

determinable the selling price of each service is determined based on management’s best estimate and allotted based on the relative selling price method 

vehicle sales where vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf are recognized on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multipleelement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting 

the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale and the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to 

   we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services prior to the adoption of asu 200913 we used the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when the fair value of delivered items had not been established and deferred all arrangement consideration when fair value was not available for undelivered items 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in accordance with asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

 41 

 the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values as of july 31 2013 and july 31 2012 due to the shortterm nature of those instruments and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments see note 9 longterm debt for fair value disclosures related to our longterm debt 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “abnormal” as provided in the guidance in addition the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

in early november 2012 hurricane sandy hit the northeastern coast of the united states as a result of the extensive flooding that it caused we expended additional costs for i temporary storage facilities ii premiums for subhaulers as they were reassigned from other regions and iii labor costs incurred for overtime travel and lodging due to the reassignment of employees to the affected region these costs which are characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory  were expensed as incurred and not included in inventory as of july 31 2013 the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of hurricane sandy have been sold 

derivatives and hedging 

we have entered into two interest rate swaps to eliminate interest rate risk on our variable rate term loan and the swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges under asc 815 derivatives and hedging see note 10 derivatives and hedging  each quarter we measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method” and record in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness with the effective portion of the hedges’ change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income or loss 

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life generally three years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets total gross capitalized software as of july 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was 743 million 550 million and 468 million respectively accumulated amortization expense 

related to software for july 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was 286 million 191 million and 102 million respectively 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance ie total writeoffstotal accounts receivable writeoff percentage we note that a one percentage point deviation in the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of 15 million 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada the uk brazil germany and spain in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2013 we have 16 million of valuation allowance arising from both of our us and foreign operations to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations as a result we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 

based on our results for the twelve months ended july 31 2013 a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of 28 million 

we apply the provision of asc 740 which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on 

audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement 

although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service and us states we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method compensation cost related to stockbased payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes merton option pricing model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000 deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which is 225000 per claim in addition each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies is 61 million as of july 31 2013 if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our medical expense would change by 10 million and our medical accrual would change by 04 million if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our workers’ compensation expense would change by less than 01 million and our accrual for workers’ 

compensation expenses would change by less than 01 million a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than 01 million 

segment reporting 

our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 1 summary of significant accounting policies 

 our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets as of july 31 2013 all of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2013 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held during the twelve months ended july 31 2013 a 10 change in our interest yield would not materially affect our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the credit facility were 3688 million as of july 31 2013 amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest subject to certain restrictions at a fluctuating rate based on i the eurocurrency rate ii the federal funds rate or iii the prime rate as described in the credit facility a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to 20 above the otherwise applicable interest rate based on the average credit facility balance held during the year ended july 31 2013 a 10 change in our interest rate would not materially affect our operating results 

we have entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan balance to mitigate the interest expense risk 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues result from transactions by our canadian uk uae brazilian spain and german operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar the british pound the uae dirham the brazilian real and the euro our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility accordingly our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the 

us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham brazilian real or euro in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decreaseincrease to revenue of 228 million for the twelve months ended july 31 2013 

fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2013 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of 454 million this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar british pound uae dirham brazilian real or euro will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

  risk factors tableend investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialized the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during the fiscal year ended july 31 2012 historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues seller arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our expansion into markets outside north america including recent expansions in europe and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired outside of north america into our operations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we first expanded our operations outside north america in 2007 with a significant acquisition in the united kingdom and we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside north america in august 2012 we announced our acquisition of a company in the united arab emirates acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside north america pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in international markets among other things we will ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology integration and integration of financial and administrative functions may not proceed as we anticipate and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses including unanticipated capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

       as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition certain acquisitions in the united kingdom may be reviewed by the office of fair trade oft andor competition commission uk regulators if an inquiry is made by uk regulators we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulators will agree with us if they decide to make an inquiry if the uk regulators determine that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulators the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

we face risks associated with the implementation of our salvage auction model in markets that may not operate on the same terms as the north american market for example the uk market operates on a principal rather than agent basis which has tended to have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and has exposed us to inventory risks that we do not experience in north america 

some of our target markets outside north america operate in a manner substantially different than our historic market in north america for example the uk market operates primarily on the principal model in which we take title to vehicles rather than the agency model employed in north america in which we act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles as a result our operations in the uk have had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our consolidated gross margin percentages operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence in addition our business in north america and the united kingdom has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers in other markets insurers have traditionally been less 

involved in the disposition of salvage vehicles as we expand into markets outside north america and the united kingdom we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers 

if the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning “erp” system is not executed efficiently and effectively our business financial position and our consolidated operating results could be adversely affected 

we are in the process of converting our primary management information system to a new standard erp system which will occur in phases through 2013 and 2014 in the event this conversion of our primary management information system is not executed efficiently and effectively the conversion may cause interruptions in our primary management information systems which may make our website and services unavailable this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform vb 2  which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

in addition our information and technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses network failures computer and telecommunications failures infiltration by unauthorized persons and security breaches usage errors by our employees power outages and catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes although we have not been the victim of cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our consolidated operating results or financial position we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses and similar information technology violations in the ordinary course of business we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions if these systems are compromised become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired if that were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in north america and the uk 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations over the last decade had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales we implemented our online system across all of our north american and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 respectively and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices as well as improved operating efficiencies in both markets in considering new markets we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in north america and the uk we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories for example hurricanes katrina and rita had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the gulf coast area we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our 

capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

     as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

     our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

       17 

             due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert 

management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our north american storage facilities we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of our operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted further we rely on independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate 16 of our common stock as of july 31 2012 if they were to act together these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors any amendments to our articles of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these stockholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an antitakeover effect or that may delay defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 

our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time without stockholder approval up to an aggregate of 5000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include rights superior to 

the rights of the holders of common stock in addition our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer and vincent w mitz our president or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

our cash investments are subject to numerous risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

the impairment of capitalized development costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or roll out if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public may involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during the fiscal year ended july 31 2006 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in gulf coast states these additional costs characterized as “abnormal” under asc 330 inventory were recognized during the fiscal year ended july 31 2006 and included the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices and declines in used car prices may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts or pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion 

plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share consolidated results of operations and financial condition additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws affecting the importation of salvage vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of salvage vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of salvage vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for salvage vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the united states the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination 

by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

volatility in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has led to an economic downturn in the us and abroad as a result of the economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles adverse credit conditions may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or remain volatile our credit facility may be affected 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations in recent periods the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet has increased substantially principally as a result of a series of acquisitions we have made in the uk since 2007 as of july 31 2012 the amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was 1964 million 

pursuant to asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in the definition of a business segment in which we operate changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations changes in competition or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization changes in these factors or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance could affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets which may result in an impairment charge for example continued deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that goodwill impairment is required with respect to our acquisitions in the uk we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets should the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

an adverse outcome of a pending georgia sales tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

the georgia department of revenue or dor conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of the audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to remit sales taxes totaling 738 million including penalties and interest in issuing the notice of proposed assessment the 

dor stated its policy position that sales for resale to nonus registered resellers are subject to georgia sales and use tax 

we have engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel has provided us with an opinion that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm and advice from outside tax advisors we have not provided for the payment of this assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the dor’s notice of proposed assessment and intend to defend this matter we have filed a request for protest or administrative appeal with the state of georgia there can be no assurance however that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the georgia dor we understand that georgia law and dor regulations are ambiguous on many of the points at issue in the audit and litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements and consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound and canadian dollar could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

fluctuations in the us unemployment rates could result in declines in revenue from processing insurance vehicles 

increases in unemployment may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us 

if the interest rate swap entered into in connection with our credit facility proves ineffective it could result in volatility in our operating results including potential losses which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

we entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payment commitments for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan the notional amount of the two derivative transactions amortizes 188 million per quarter until september 30 2015 and 200 million on december 14 2015 the first swap agreement fixed our interest rate with respect to a notional amount of 3375 million of our term loan at 85 basis points plus the one month libor rate the second swap agreement fixed our interest rate with respect to a notional amount of 1063 million of our term loan at 69 basis points plus the one month libor rate the applicable rate on our credit facility can fluctuate between 15 and 20 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility and at july 31 2012 was 150 

we recorded the swap at fair value and it is currently designated as an effective cash flow hedge under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  each quarter we will measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method” and record in earnings any gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness the hedge provided by our swap could prove to be ineffective for a number of reasons including early retirement of the term loan as is allowed under the credit facility or in the event the counterparty to the interest rate swap is determined in the future to not be creditworthy any determination that the hedge created by the swap is ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and result in volatility in our operating results in addition any changes in relevant accounting standards relating to the swap especially asc 815 derivatives and hedging  could materially increase earnings volatility

overview 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb 2  vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters however at certain locations we sell directly to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs in the united states and canada or north america we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the united kingdom or uk a significant portion of our business is conducted on a principal basis purchasing salvage vehicles outright from insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account 

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program or pip program where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs under the consignment programs only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual 

sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 we converted all of our north american and uk sales respectively to an internetbased auctionstyle model using our vb 2 internet sales technology which employs a twostep bidding process the first step called the preliminary bid allows members to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual auction begins the second step allows members to bid against each other and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process in a realtime process over the internet 

acquisitions and new operations 

we have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired nine facilities and established three new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2010 through july 31 2012 all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have 155 facilities located in north america and the uk as of july 31 2012 and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2009 through july 31 2012 

 

 

in january 2010 the company completed the acquisition of d hales limited d hales which operated five locations in the united kingdom in fiscal 2011 we acquired john hewitt and sons limited hewitt which operated one location in the united kingdom these acquisitions were undertaken because of their strategic fit with our business in the united kingdom in august 2012 we acquired ride safely middle east auction llc located in dubai uae 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial condition is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it is our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

revenues 

the following table sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands except percentages 

 service revenues service revenues were 7573 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 7131 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of 442 million or 62 above fiscal 2011 growth in unit volume generated 335 million in additional service revenue relative to last year and was driven primarily by growth in the number of units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and the migration from the principal model to the agency model in the uk growth in the average revenue per car sold generated 115 million in additional revenue over last year and was driven by an increase in the average vehicle auction selling price as over 50 of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle we believe the increase in the average vehicle auction selling price was driven primarily by i the year over year increase in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the general increase in used car pricing which we believe has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles which are repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user iii the mix of cars sold as the insurance company cars which on average command a lower average selling price than noninsurance cars represented a lower portion of all cars sold and iv in the uk the beneficial impact of vb 2 which we introduced in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide we cannot determine the impact of the movement of these influences as we cannot determine which vehicles are sold to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export nor can we predict their future movement accordingly we cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing used car pricing product sales mix and the introduction of vb 2 in the uk had on the selling price of vehicles and ultimately on service revenue the average dollar to pound exchange rate was 158 dollars to the pound and 160 dollars to the pound for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectively and led to a decrease in service revenue of 08 million 

vehicle sales we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account vehicle sales revenues were 1669 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 1592 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of 77 million or 48 above fiscal 2011 the increase in vehicle sales revenue was due to the growth in the average selling price of vehicles which resulted in increased revenue of 202 million the growth in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to i the increase in commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling and ii in the uk the continuing beneficial impact of vb 2 which we introduced to the uk in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide we cannot determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the specific impact of commodity pricing nor can we isolate the impact that vb 2 had on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold in the uk the decline in volume resulted primarily from the migration of certain contracts in the uk from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of 111 million the detrimental impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 14 million 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses were 3776 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 3741 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of 35 million or 09 above fiscal 2011 the increase was driven by volume which led to an increase of 135 million as we processed more vehicles in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 this increase was offset by a reduction in operating costs of 55 million driven by the decline in the cost to process each car there was a detrimental impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate of 05 million included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 330 million and 370 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2012 and 2011 respectively

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were 994 million for fiscal 2012 compared to 989 million for fiscal 2011 an increase of less than 05 million or 05 the beneficial impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 01 million general and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses were 151 million and 87 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

impairment  during the year ended july 31 2012 we recorded an impairment of 88 million associated with the write down to fair market value of certain assets primarily real estate computer hardware and our fleet of private aircraft which have been removed from operations and if not disposed of during the year are reflected in assets held for sale on the balance sheet 

other expense income total other expense was 83 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 14 million during fiscal 2011 an increase of 69 million or 4929 interest expense increased 73 million as a result of increased borrowing under the new credit facility which is further described in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 9 longterm debt  which is incorporated herein by reference other income net increased 05 million due primarily to the gain on sale of assets 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2012 and 2011 were 345 and 369 respectively the change in tax rates was primarily driven by the geographical allocation of income and the application of new elective tax law starting in fiscal 2012

decline in volume resulted primarily from the migration of certain contracts in the uk from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of 08 million the beneficial impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 21 million 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses were 3741 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 3202 million for fiscal 2010 an increase of 539 million or 168 above fiscal 2010 the increase was driven primarily by i the growth in volume of units processed ii the adoption of asu 200913 iii increase in subhauling costs due to the growth in diesel prices on a year over year basis and iv the general growth in program costs associated with new business segments there was a detrimental impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate of 08 million included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 370 million and 349 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2011 and 2010 respectively

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were 989 million for fiscal 2011 compared to 1006 million for fiscal 2010 a decrease of 17 million or 17 the decline in general and administrative costs was due primarily to decreased advertising costs and decreased headcount depreciation and amortization expenses were 87 million and 83 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the detrimental impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 01 million

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 369 and 367 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of working capital is cash generated though operations potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity however with respect to the issuance of equity or debt we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and if available if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees members’ fees and reimbursable 

advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars totaled by the insurance companies during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

our primary source of working capital is net income accordingly factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital those primary factors i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v salvage frequency vi change in market share of our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchanges rates x product mix and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate are discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections in this form 10k 

as of july 31 2012 we had working capital of 1349 million including cash and cash equivalents of 1401 million cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of us treasury bills and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at a variable rate cash and cash equivalents increased by 661 million from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 the increase in cash was due primarily to the 1250 million of proceeds from additional debt proceeds from the sale of assets held for sale and from stock option exercises and cash from operations which were offset by share repurchase activity payments on outstanding debt and capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 

as of july 31 2012 588 million of the 1401 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 133 million to 2297 million during fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease was driven in part by increased deferred income taxes of 155 million a 121 million increase in vehicle pooling costs as a result of the adoption of asu 200913 in fiscal 2011 offset by an increase in net income of 157 million the remaining decrease of 14 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 435 million to 2429 million during fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was driven in part by an increase in net income of 147 million a reduction in income tax receivables of 86 million and by a reduction in vehicle pooling costs of 144 million as a result of the adoption of asu 200913 the remaining increase of 58 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

investing activities 

capital expenditures excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were 548 million 702 million and 758 million for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities software development and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations we have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2012 during fiscal 2011 we sold our corporate headquarters building in fairfield california for 165 million and entered into a twentyone month lease term during fiscal 2013 we terminated this lease

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to vehicle pooling costs selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements where appropriate we discuss sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current north american contracts collecting the proceeds from the member upon adoption of the new accounting standard for evaluating multipleelement arrangements presale services including towing title processing preparation and storage sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service net of applicable rebates or allowances for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle the revenue associated with the presale services are recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and determinable the selling price of each service is determined based on management’s best estimate and allotted based on the relative selling price method 

vehicle sales where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf are recognized on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to 

separate them into units of accounting within a multipleelement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting 

the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale and the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to 

   on august 1 2010 we prospectively adopted asu 200913 consequently we recognize in the period earned certain revenues primarily towing fees titling fees and other enhancement service fees which were previously deferred until the period the car associated with those revenues was sold as a result of this adoption for the twelve months ended july 31 2011 we accelerated recognition of 144 million in service revenue and 135 million in related yard operation expenses 

we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting contained within an arrangement containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services prior to the adoption of asu 200913 we used the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when the fair value of delivered items had not been established and deferred all arrangement consideration when fair value was not available for undelivered items 

fair value of financial instruments 

we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in accordance with asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures asc 820 as amended by accounting standards update 201104 we consider fair value as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 

 42 

the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements which included cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values as of july 31 2012 and july 31 2011 due to the shortterm nature of those instruments see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 9 longterm debt  

derivatives and hedging 

we have entered into interest rate swaps to eliminate interest rate risk on our variable rate term loan and the swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges under asc 815 derivatives and hedging see the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 10 derivatives and hedging  each quarter we measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method” and record in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness with the effective portion of the hedges change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income or loss 

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life generally three years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets total capitalized software as of july 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was 550 million 468 million and 229 million respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software for july 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was 191 million 102 million and 93 respectively 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of the guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense excessive spoilage double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “so abnormal” as provided in the guidance in addition the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance ie total writeoffstotal accounts receivable writeoff percentage we note that a one percentage point deviation in the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of less than 12 million 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our north america and uk operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada and uk in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2012 we had 12 million of valuation allowance arising from the state operating losses where we had discontinued certain operations previously and from capital losses in the us and the uk to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income taxes have been sufficiently provided to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations as a result we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 

based on our results for the twelve months ended july 31 2012 a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of 28 million 

we apply the provision of asc 740 which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement 

although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service and us states we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method compensation cost related to stockbased payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes merton option pricing model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000 deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which is 225000 per claim in addition each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies is 57 million as of july 31 2012 if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our medical expense would change by 06 million and our medical accrual would change by 04 million if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our workers’ compensation expense would change by 50000 and our accrual for workers’ compensation expenses would change by 50000 a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than 25000 

segment reporting 

our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements — note 1 summary of significant accounting policies 

 our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets as of july 31 2012 all of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2012 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held during the twelve months ended july 31 2012 a 10 change in our interest yield would not materially affect our operating results 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the credit facility were 4438 million as of july 31 2012 amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest subject to certain restrictions at a fluctuating rate based on i the eurocurrency rate ii the federal funds rate or iii the prime rate as described in the credit facility a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to 20 above the otherwise applicable interest rate 

we have entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan balance 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues result from transactions by our canadian and uk operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar and the british pound our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility accordingly our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and british pound in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decreaseincrease to revenue of 199 million for the twelve months ended july 31 2012 

fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2012 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of 349 million this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar or the british pound will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 legal proceedings 

we are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage and handling or disposal of vehicles these legal proceedings include the following matters 

on november 20 2007 car auction  reinsurance solutions inc cars filed suit against us in the superior court in the county of new castle delaware cars was seeking in excess of 20 million in damages punitive damages and prejudgment interest related to allegations involving breach of contract and misrepresentation on september 15 2011 the parties reached a settlement amount that was not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

on august 21 2008 a former employee filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission or eeoc claiming in part that he was denied employment based on his race and subjected to unlawful retaliation we responded to the charge of discrimination explaining that we have a policy prohibiting the employment of individuals with certain criminal offenses and that the former employee was terminated after it was belatedly discovered that he had been convicted of a felony and other crimes prior to being hired by us the charge of discrimination lay dormant at the eeoc for over two years in january 

2011 however the eeoc began actively investigating the allegations and challenging our policy of conducting criminal background checks and denying employment based on certain criminal convictions it is the eeoc’s position that such a practice is unlawful because it has a disparate impact on minorities it is our position that our policy is required by one of our largest auto insurance company customers because our customer is in the insurance and financial services industry its operations are heavily regulated the federal deposit insurance act 12 usc §1829 prohibits savings and loan holding companies such as our customer from employing “any person who has been convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or a breach of trust or money laundering or has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with a prosecution for such offense” in turn it is our understanding that our customer is obligated to make sure its vendors such as us comply with similar hiring restrictions the eeoc is still investigating the charge of discrimination we anticipate that if the charge of discrimination is not dismissed or settled the eeoc will file a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of all former employees and applicants of ours who were denied employment because of our policy we believe that our practices are not unlawful and intend to continue to vigorously defend this action 

on april 23 2010 deborah hill filed suit against us in the twentieth judicial circuit of collier county florida alleging negligent destruction of evidence in connection with a stored vehicle that suffered damage due to a fire at our facility in florida where the vehicle was being stored relief sought is for compensatory damages costs and interest allowed by law we believe the claim is without merit and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit 

on september 21 2010 robert ortiz and carlos torres filed suit against us in superior court of san bernardino county san bernardino district which purported to be a class action on behalf of persons employed by us in the positions of facilities managers and assistant general managers in california at any time since the date four years prior to september 21 2010 the complaint alleges failure to pay wages and overtime wages failure to provide meal breaks and rest breaks in violation of various california labor and business and professional code sections due to alleged misclassification of facilities managers and assistant general managers as exempt employees relief sought includes class certification injunctive relief damages according to proof restitution for unpaid wages disgorgement of illgotten gains civil penalties attorney’s fees and costs interest and punitive damages we believe the claim is without merit and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit 

on february 12 2011 jose e brizuela filed suit against us in superior court san bernardino county san bernardino district which purports to be class action on behalf of persons employed by us paid on a hourly basis in california at any time since the date four years prior to february 14 2011 the complaint alleges failure to pay all earned wages due to an alleged practice of rounding of hours worked to the detriment of the employees relief sought includes class certification injunctive relief unpaid wages waiting time penaltywages interest and attorney’s fees and costs of suit we believe the claim is without merit and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit 

on august 10 2011 glenn a mangis and lynn brownmangis husband and wife filed suit against us in the superior court of washington for pierce county alleging exposure to asbestos during the course of his employment as a carpenter electrician and laborer and as a direct result of said exposure plaintiff developed mesothelioma plaintiff’s wife is alleging loss of spousal relationship as a result relief sought is for general and special damages medical and related expenses costs and disbursements in case prejudgment interest and all other relief the court deems just no specific amount was given we believe the claim is without merit and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit 

we provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with 

these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when insurance is purchased 

governmental proceedings 

the georgia department of revenue or dor recently conducted a sales and use tax audit of our operations in georgia for the period from january 1 2007 through june 30 2011 as a result of the audit the dor issued a notice of proposed assessment for uncollected sales taxes in which it asserted that we failed to remit sales taxes totaling 738 million including penalties and interest in issuing the notice of proposed assessment the dor stated its policy position that sales for resale to nonus registered resellers are subject to georgia sales and use tax 

we have engaged a georgia law firm and outside tax advisors to review the conduct of our business operations in georgia the notice of assessment and the dor’s policy position in particular our outside legal counsel has provided us with an opinion that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax in rendering its opinion our counsel noted that nonus registered resellers are unable to comply strictly with technical requirements for a georgia certificate of exemption but concluded that our sales for resale to nonus registered resellers should not be subject to georgia sales and use tax notwithstanding this technical inability to comply 

based on the opinion from our outside law firm and advice from outside tax advisors we have not provided for the payment of this assessment in our consolidated financial statements we believe we have strong defenses to the dor’s notice of proposed assessment and intend to defend this matter we have filed a request for protest or administrative appeal with the state of georgia there can be no assurance however that this matter will be resolved in our favor or that we will not ultimately be required to make a substantial payment to the georgia dor we understand that georgia law and dor regulations are ambiguous on many of the points at issue in the audit and litigating and defending the matter in georgia could be expensive and timeconsuming and result in substantial management distraction if the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to copart it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial statements

overview 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb 2  sellers are primarily insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators and vehicle rental companies we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters however at certain locations we sell directly to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs in the united states and canada or north america we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the united kingdom or uk a significant portion of our business is conducted on a principal basis purchasing salvage vehicles outright from insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account 

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program or pip program where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs under the consignment programs only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual 

sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 we converted all of our north american and uk sales respectively to an internetbased auctionstyle model using our vb 2 internet sales technology which employs a twostep bidding process the first step called the preliminary bid allows members to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual auction begins the second step allows members to bid against each other and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process in a realtime process over the internet 

acquisitions and new operations 

we have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired seven facilities and established seven new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2009 all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have 153 facilities located in north america and the uk as of july 31 2011 and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2008 through july 31 2011 

 

  

in january 2010 the company completed the acquisition of d hales limited d hales which operated five locations in the united kingdom in fiscal 2011 we acquired john hewitt and sons limited hewitt 

which operated one location in the united kingdom these acquisitions were undertaken because of their strategic fit with our business in the united kingdom 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial condition is affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it is our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

revenues 

the following table sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands except percentages 

 service revenues service revenues were 7236 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 6421 million for fiscal 2010 an increase of 815 million or 127 above fiscal 2010 growth in unit volume generated 639 million in additional service revenue relative to last year and was driven primarily by growth in the number of units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and the migration from the principal model to the agency model in the uk growth in the average revenue per car sold generated 19 million in additional revenue over last year as higher scrap metal and used car pricing led to a general increase in the average selling price and consequently higher revenue per car sold and was offset by growth in the percentage of volume processed from suppliers with below average revenue per car the average dollar to pound exchange rate was 160 dollars to the pound and 157 dollars to the pound for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively and led to an increase in service revenue of 13 million 

over 50 of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle we believe the increase in the average selling price was primarily impacted by i the year over year increase in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the general increase in used car pricing which we believe has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles which are repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user and iii in the uk the continuing beneficial impact of vb 2 which we introduced to the uk in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide we cannot determine the impact of the movement of these factors nor can we predict their future movement further we cannot determine which vehicles are sold to the end user or for 

scrap dismantling retailing or export accordingly we cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and the introduction of vb 2 had on the selling price of vehicles and ultimately on service revenue 

in addition on august 1 2010 we adopted accounting standards update asu 200913  revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements asu 200913 consequently we recognized in the period earned certain revenues primarily towing fees titling fees and other enhancement service fees which were previously deferred until the period the car associated with those revenues was sold as a result of this change we recognized 144 million in additional revenue for the fiscal year ended july 31 2011 which would have otherwise been recognized in future periods 

vehicle sales we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account vehicle sales revenues were 1486 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 1307 million for fiscal 2010 an increase of 179 million or 137 above fiscal 2010 the increase in vehicle sales revenue was due to the growth in the average selling price of vehicles which resulted in increased revenue of 163 million the growth in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to i the increase in commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling and ii in the uk the continuing beneficial impact of vb 2 which we introduced to the uk in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide we cannot determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the specific impact of commodity pricing nor can we isolate the impact that vb 2 had on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold in the uk the decline in volume resulted primarily from the migration of certain contracts in the uk from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of 08 million the beneficial impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 24 million 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses were 3741 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 3202 million for fiscal 2010 an increase of 539 million or 168 above fiscal 2010 the increase was driven primarily by i the growth in volume of units processed ii the adoption of asu 200913 iii increase in subhauling costs due to the growth in diesel prices on a year over year basis and iv the general growth in program costs associated with new business segments there was a detrimental impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate of 08 million included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 370 million and 349 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

on august 1 2010 we adopted asu 200913 consequently we recognized certain revenues and expenses associated primarily with towing fees titling fees and seller storage fees which were previously deferred until the period the car associated with those revenues and expenses was sold the expenses recognized for the year ended july 31 2011 which would have otherwise been recognized in future periods was 135 million 

cost of vehicle sales the cost of vehicles sold was 1252 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 1047 million for fiscal 2010 an increase of 205 million or 196 the increase in the cost per unit sold represented a 190 million increase relative to last year unit volume decrease led to a decrease of 06 million the detrimental impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 21 million 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were 1076 million for fiscal 2011 compared to 1089 million for fiscal 2010 a decrease of 13 million or 12 the decline in general and administrative costs was due primarily to decreased advertising costs and decreased headcount also included in general and administrative expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 87 million and 83 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the detrimental 

impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 01 million 

other income expense total other expense was 14 million during fiscal 2011 compared to other income of 04 million for fiscal 2010 an increase of 18 million or 4324 interest expense increased 39 million as a result of increased borrowing under the new credit facility refer to footnote 10 for additional information regarding the facility interest income declined 03 million due primarily to reduced interest yields and a lower cash balance other income net increased 17 million due primarily to the gain on sale of assets 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 369 and 367 respectively 

net income due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of 1664 million for fiscal 2011 compared to net income of 1516 million for fiscal 2010 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

revenues 

the following sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands except percentages 

 service revenues service revenues were 6421 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 6154 million for fiscal 2009 an increase of 268 million or 44 above fiscal 2009 the increase in service revenue was due primarily to an increase in the average revenue per car sold the increase in the revenue per car sold was driven by increased selling prices as over 50 of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle at the auction we believe the increase in the average selling price was primarily due to i an increase in commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling and ii the general increase in used car pricing which has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles that are either repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user we cannot determine the movement of these influences nor can we determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing and used car pricing had on the selling price of vehicles unit volume grew by over one percent resulting in an increase in revenue of 71 million the average dollar to pound exchange rate was 157 dollars to the pound and 159 dollars to the pound for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively and led to a reduction in service revenue of 02 million 

vehicle sales we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account vehicle sales revenues were 1307 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 1277 million for fiscal 2009 an increase of 30 million or 24 above fiscal 2009 the increase in vehicle sales revenue was due to the rise in the average selling price of vehicles which resulted in increased revenue of 300 million the rise in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to i the increase in commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the general increase in used car pricing which has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles that are either repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user and iii in the uk the continuing beneficial impact of vb 2 which we introduced to the uk in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide we cannot determine which vehicles are sold directly to 

the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the specific impact of commodity pricing and used car pricing nor can we isolate the impact that vb 2 had on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold in the uk the change in volume reflects the migration of certain contracts in the uk from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of 250 million the negative impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 20 million 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses were 3202 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 3248 million for fiscal 2009 a decline of 46 million or 14 below fiscal 2009 the decline was driven primarily by operational efficiencies and by reductions in subhauling costs relative to the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 when the cost of diesel fuel peaked included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 349 million and 328 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

cost of vehicle sales the cost of vehicles sold was 1047 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 1060 million for fiscal 2009 a decline of 14 million or 13 unit volume decline led to a reduction of 180 million and was primarily due to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee basis cost per unit sold was up and represented a 171 million increase relative to last year the negative impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 05 million 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were 1089 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 869 million for fiscal 2009 an increase of 220 million or 253 the growth in general and administrative costs was due primarily to i increased advertising costs as we invested in events and media promotions including nascar and nhra sponsorships to generate new member activity ii the additional costs associated with the chairman and chief executive officer’s noncash compensation package approved by the shareholders in april 2009 and iii increased headcount these changes increased general and administrative expenses by 86 million 61 million and 48 million respectively also included in general and administrative expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 83 million and 90 million for the years ended july 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

other income expense total other income was 04 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 24 million for fiscal 2009 a decline of 20 million or 823 net interest income declined 14 million due primarily to reduced interest yields other income net declined 06 million primarily due a decline in rental income of 17 million and the loss of 08 million on the sale of an airplane in fiscal 2010 and was offset by a 11 million impairment of a note receivable relating to the disposal of the assets of a discontinued business and a 10 million loss on the sale of an airplane in fiscal 2009 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 367 and 387 respectively the decrease was driven primarily by the reduction of state income taxes and the favorable tax treatment we received relating to certain interest expenses in the uk 

net income due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of 1516 million for fiscal 2010 compared to net income of 1411 million for fiscal 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of working capital is cash generated though operations potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity however with respect to the issuance of equity or debt we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and if available if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary 

source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees members’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars totaled by the insurance companies during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

our primary source of working capital is net income accordingly factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital those primary factors i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v salvage frequency vi change in market share of our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchanges rates x product mix and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate are discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections in this form 10k 

as of july 31 2011 we had working capital of 752 million including cash and cash equivalents of 740 million cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of us treasury bills and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at a variable rate cash and cash equivalents decreased by 1942 million from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 the decrease in cash was due primarily to the share repurchase activity during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 7396 million of common stock of which 400 million was financed with term debt borrowings in connection with the tender offer discussed below in financing activities 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 435 million to 2429 million during fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was driven in part by an increase in net income of 147 million a reduction in income tax receivables of 86 million and by a reduction in vehicle pooling costs of 144 million as a result of the adoption of asu 200913 the remaining increase of 58 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 39 million to 1994 million during fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009 due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 93 million to 2033 million during fiscal 2009 when compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was driven primarily by a reduction in income taxes receivable of 180 million which was offset by a decrease in net income of 158 million the remaining increase of 71 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

investing activities 

capital expenditures related to continuing operations excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were 702 million 758 million and 789 million for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities software development and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations we have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2011 during fiscal 2011 we sold our corporate headquarters building in fairfield ca for 165 million and entered into a two year lease with a six month extension option at the end of the lease term

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to vehicle pooling costs selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition sharebased compensation longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011 the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements where appropriate we discuss sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current north american contracts collecting the proceeds from the member upon adoption of the new accounting standard for evaluating multipleelement arrangements presale services including towing title processing preparation and storage sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service net of applicable rebates or allowances for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle the revenue associated with the presale services are recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and determinable the selling price of each service is determined based on management’s best estimate and allotted based on the relative selling price method 

vehicle sales where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf are recognized on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multipleelement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting 

the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale and the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to 

   on august 1 2010 we prospectively adopted asu 200913 consequently we recognize in the period earned certain revenues primarily towing fees titling fees and other enhancement service fees which were previously deferred until the period the car associated with those revenues was sold as a result of this adoption for the twelve months ended july 31 2011 we accelerated recognition of 144 million in service revenue and 135 million in related yard operation expenses 

we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting contained within an arrangement containing multiple deliverables estimated selling prices are determined using management’s best estimate significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends pricing customization and practices and profit objectives for the services prior to the adoption of asu 200913 we used the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when the fair value of delivered items had not been established and deferred all arrangement consideration when fair value was not available for undelivered items 

capitalized software costs 

we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred internaluse software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life generally three years management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets total capitalized software as of july 31 2011 2010 and 2009 was 468 million 229 million and 100 million respectively accumulated amortization expense related to software for july 31 2011 2010 and 2009 totaled 102 million 93 million and 91 respectively 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of the guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense excessive spoilage double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “so abnormal” as provided in the guidance in addition the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance ie total writeoffstotal accounts receivable writeoff percentage we note that a one percentage point deviation in the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of less than 11 million 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our north america and uk operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income tax exposures as required under asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada and uk in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2011 we had 09 million of valuation allowance arising from the net operating losses in states where we had discontinued certain operations in prior years and the potential losses if certain capital assets are sold in the uk to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 

historically our income taxes have been sufficiently provided to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations as a result we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 

based on our results for the twelve months ended july 31 2011 a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of 26 million 

we apply the provision of asc 740 which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement 

although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service and us states we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

sharebased compensation 

we account for our sharebased payment awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method compensation cost related to sharebased payment transactions measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued be recognized in the consolidated financial statements determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes merton option pricing model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000 deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which is 225000 per claim in addition each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies is 55 million as of july 31 2011 if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our medical expense would change by 09 million and our medical accrual would change by 350000 if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our workers’ compensation expense would change by 50000 and our accrual for workers’ compensation expenses would change by 50000 a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than 25000 

segment reporting 

our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk 

interest income risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets as of july 31 2011 all of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits us treasury bills and money market funds as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2011 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held during the twelve months ended july 31 2011 a 10 change in our interest yield would not materially affect our operating results we do not hedge interest rate fluctuation risks 

interest expense risk 

our total borrowings under the credit facility were 3751 million as of july 31 2011 amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest subject to certain restrictions at a fluctuating rate based on i the eurocurrency rate ii the federal funds rate or iii the prime rate as described in the credit facility a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to 20 above the otherwise applicable interest rate at july 31 2011 the interest rate was the eurocurrency rate plus 150 

changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of income an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates as of july 31 2011 if the eurocurrency rate increased by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense by 21 million for the year ended july 31 2011 as of july 31 2011 we have not entered into any interest rate swaps of forward interest rate contracts to mitigate the risk 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues result from transactions by our canadian and uk operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar and the british pound our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility accordingly our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and british pound in which our revenues and profits are 

denominated would result in a decreaseincrease to revenue of 191 million for the twelve months ended july 31 2011 there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous as a result the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect income 

fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2011 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of 232 million this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar or the british pound will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 item 1 business 

general 

copart inc is a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us canada and the united kingdom uk 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb 2  sellers are primarily insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators vehicle rental companies and the general public we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations we sell directly to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us and canada north america we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate both on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle for our own account and as an agent 

during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 we converted all of our north american and uk sales respectively to vb 2  vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers whom we refer to as members anywhere in the world who have internet access this technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a registered member to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility or over the internet during the preview to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 s bid4u feature will incrementally bid on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder 

we believe the implementation of vb 2 has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it has improved the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated with live auctions for fiscal 2010 sales of north american vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for 502 of total vehicles sold 275 of vehicles were sold to out of state members and 227 were sold to out of country members based on registration for fiscal 2010 sales of uk vehicles on a unit basis to members registered outside the country where the vehicle is located accounted for 177 of total vehicles sold 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

• providing coverage that facilitates seller access to buyers around the world reducing towing and thirdparty storage expenses offering a local presence for vehicle inspection stations and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by speciallytrained teams • providing a comprehensive range of customer services that include merchandising services efficient title processing timely pickup and delivery of vehicles and internet sales • establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions • increasing the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and convenience of internet bidding • applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through internet bidding webbased order processing salvage value quotes electronic communication with members and sellers vehicle imaging and an online used vehicle parts locator service and • providing the venue for insurance customers through our virtual insured exchange vix product to contingently sell a vehicle through the auction process to establish its true value allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in the overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both members and sellers and v the growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal year 2010 which ended july 31 2010 our revenues were approximately 7729 million and our operating income was approximately 2391 million 

on june 14 2007 we entered the uk salvage market through the acquisition of universal salvage plc universal in fiscal 2008 we made the following additional acquisitions century salvage sales limited century on august 1 2007 ag watson auto salvage  motors spares scotland limited ag watson on february 29 2008 simpson bros york holdings limited simpson on april 4 2008 in fiscal 2010 we acquired d hales limited d hales on january 22 2010 universal century ag watson and d hales were all leading providers of vehicle auctions and services to the motor insurance and automotive industries simpson was primarily an auto dismantler and was acquired primarily for its real estate holdings 

in fiscal 2008 we initiated two new programs using vb 2  i copart dealer services cds by which we sell dealertradeins and ii copartdirect whereby we sell cars on behalf of the general public our goal through these two programs is to expand vb 2 s application beyond traditional salvage in order to expand our customer base cds targets franchise and independent dealerships while copartdirect targets the general public 

in fiscal 2009 we opened our website to the public initiated our registered broker program by which the public can purchase vehicles through a member and initiated our market maker program by which members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks that enable the general public to browse and view our inventory and purchase vehicles from us through the market maker 

in fiscal 2010 we initiated two additional programs using vb 2  i 2 nd chance bidding which allows the second highest bidder of a vehicle the opportunity to purchase the vehicle for the sellers current minimum bid after the high bidder declines and ii night cap sales which provides sellers an additional opportunity to have members bid on their vehicles increasing exposure and minimizing cycle time 

in north america we opened one new facility located in scranton pennsylvania as of july 31 2010 we had 134 facilities in the us 2 facilities in canada and 16 facilities in the uk 

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool in north america sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on consignment either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion in north america and on a primary basis in the uk companies in our industry will purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based either on a percentage of the vehicles estimated preaccident cash value andor based on the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and delivered to the buyer while most companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction copart sells all of its vehicles on its internet selling platform vb 2  thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators vehicle rental companies and the general public the primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

automobile manufacturers are incorporating new standard features including unibody construction passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic components airbags xenon lights computer systems heated seats and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes 

the primary buyers of the vehicles are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some states the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

the majority of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance companys adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicles mileage options and condition in order to estimate its preaccident value pav or actual cash value acv the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjusters estimate of repair costs vehicles salvage value and the pav or acv as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the preaccident value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

• the anticipated percentage return on salvage ie gross salvage proceeds minus vehicle handling and selling expenses divided by the actual cash value • the services provided by the company and the degree to which such services reduce administrative costs and expenses 5 

• the price the company charges for its services • national coverage • the ability to respond to natural disasters • the ability to provide analytical data to the seller and • in the uk the actual amount paid for the vehicle in the uk insurance companies generally tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles the insurance company will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pick up order the assignment we arrange for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicles release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle or invoiced separately to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate states motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold either at a live auction or in our case on vb 2 typically within 7 days proceeds are then collected from the member seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller

personal and business information and have in most states a vehicle dismantlers dealers resale repair or export license in certain venues we may sell to the general public registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements however nonregistered buyers may transact business at any of our sales via a registered broker who meets the local licensing and permitting requirements a member may also bring guests to a facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale we market to members on the internet and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in north america include kar holdings inc formerly adesa inc and insurance auto auctions inc auction broadcasting company and manheim auctions the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation lkq lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in the uk our principal competitors are privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business operating software that we developed and which tracks salvage sales vehicles throughout the sales process we have implemented our proprietary business operating software at all of our storage facilities in addition we have integrated our mainframe computer system with internet and intranet systems in order to provide secure access to our data and images in a variety of formats 

our auctionstyle service product vb 2  is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required 

we have invested in a production data center that is designed to run the business in the event of an emergency the facilitys electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored this facility is located in an area considered to be free of weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes 

as of july 31 2008 our uk operations were completely migrated to our proprietary business operating software and servers described above 

employees 

as of july 31 2010 we had 2834 fulltime employees of whom approximately 643 were engaged in general and administrative functions and approximately 2191 were engaged in yard operations as of july 31 2010 we had 2316 and 518 employees located in north america and the uk respectively we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oils and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination certain of our facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in aboveground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be disposed of as nonhazardous or hazardous waste as appropriate we have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities and we have initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional capital expenditures 

in connection with the acquisition of the dallas texas facility in 1994 we set aside 30 million to cover the costs of environmental remediation stabilization and related consulting expenses for a sixacre portion of the facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former operators we began the stabilization process in 1996 and completed it in 1999 we paid all remediation and related costs from the 30 million fund and in accordance with the acquisition agreement distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller of the dallas facility less 02 million which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the nofurtheraction letter in september 2002 our environmental engineering consultant issued a report which concludes that the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized the leadimpacted soil and that the concrete cap should prevent impact to storm water and subsequent surface water impact our consultant thereafter submitted an operations and maintenance plan plan to the texas commission on environmental quality tceq providing for a twoyear inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap and a twoyear ground and surface water monitoring plan in january of 2003 the tceq approved the plan subject to the additions of upstream background surface water samples from the intermittent stream adjacent to the facility and documentation of any repairs to the concrete cap during the post closuremonitoring period the first semiannual water sampling was conducted in april 2003 which reflected that the leadimpacted stabilized soil is not impacting the ground andor surface water the second round of semiannual water samples collected in october and november 2003 reported concentration of lead in one storm water and one surface water sample in excess of the established upstream criteria for lead in correspondence which we received in july 2004 the tceq approved with comment our water monitoring report dated february 24 2004 the tceq instructed us to continue with postclosure monitoring and maintenance activities and submit the next report in accordance with the approved schedules in february 2005 a report from our environmental engineering consultant was transmitted to the tceq containing the results of annual monitoring activities consisting of two 2 semiannual sampling events which occurred in apriljune 2004 and octobernovember 2004 laboratory analytical results indicated no lead concentrations exceeding the target concentration level set in the corrective measures study for the site but some results were in excess of texas surface water quality standards our environmental engineering consultant concluded in the february 2005 report to the tceq that it is unlikely that lead concentrations detected in the storm water runoff samples are attributable to the lead impacted soils based on the results of the 2004 samplings we requested that no further action be taken and that a closure letter be issued by the tceq in september 2007 the tceq notified us that they did not concur with our consultants conclusions and recommendations the tceq said it would not provide a closure letter until additional sampling of surface water is performed which reflects concentrations of lead below texas surface water quality standards in february 2008 the tceq provided comments to our proposal for surface water 

sampling in march 2008 our environmental engineer submitted to the tceq an addendum to the surface water sampling plan which was approved by the tceq in june 2008 sampling was performed in november 2008 in december 2008 a report was submitted to the tceq indicating that lead levels were below texas surface water quality standards in may of 2009 the tceq approved the surface water sampling report as well as the concrete cap inspection report submitted in december 2008 we have made the necessary repairs to the concrete cap and provided a survey map of the cap annual inspections of the cap are required to ensure its maintenance there is no assurance that we may not incur future liabilities if the stabilization process proves ineffective or if future testing of surface or ground water reflects concentrations of lead which exceed texas surface or ground water quality standards 

we do not believe that the above environmental matter will either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and international motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

legal proceedings 

we are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage and handling or disposal of vehicles this litigation includes the following matter 

on november 20 2007 car auction  reinsurance solutions inc cars filed suit against copart in the superior court in the county of new castle delaware cars is seeking in excess of 2 million in damages punitive damages and prejudgment interest related to allegations involving breach of contract and misrepresentation we believe the claim is without merit and are defending the lawsuit vigorously 

on december 16 2008 liberty mutual fire insurance company filed suit against copart in the us district court northern district of california liberty mutuals complaint sought reformation of an insurance contract and specific performance in relation to a policy issued to us with a 50000 self insured retention after settlement of a claim under the subject policy for 395 million liberty mutual sought to reform the contract and charge us for a 2 million selfinsured retention which it claimed was the original intent pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties the case was dismissed in january 2010 

we provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when insurance is purchased 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in june 2003 we filed a provisional us patent application on vb 2 in the united states this provisional patent application was followed by a us utility application filed in july 2003 and a concurrent international application that has since been nationalized and is pending in the netherlands canada australia china the european union mexico and japan the patent was issued by the united states patent and trademark office on january 1 2008 generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law we are not dependent upon any single patent application and there can be no assurance that any patents will be issued from pending applications or that any patents that are issued will provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantages to us 

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weather related accidents 




 item 1a risk factors 

  investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialized the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

although no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during the fiscal year ended july 31 2010 historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues seller arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be 

cancelled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our acquisitions in the uk expose us to risks arising from the acquisitions and risks associated with operating in markets outside north america we may acquire additional companies in the uk or other countries or seek to establish new yards or facilities to complement the acquired companies operations any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired outside of north america into our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

during fiscal 2007 we completed the acquisition of universal salvage plc or universal our first acquisition in the uk in fiscal 2008 we completed the acquisitions of century salvage sales limited century simpson bros york holdings limited and ag watson auto salvage  motor spares scotland limited ag watson all located within the uk in fiscal 2010 we completed the acquisition of d hales limited d hales which is also located in the uk we may continue to acquire additional companies or operations in the uk or other countries in europe or may seek to establish new yards or operations in the uk or europe now that we have established a presence in these markets 

our acquisitions in the uk and continued expansion of our operations outside north america pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we experienced losses associated with credit card fraud in the uk in addition our operating expenses were adversely affected in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 by incremental integration expenses we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in the uk or europe among other things we have deployed vb 2 technologies at all of our operations in the uk and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology integration and integration of financial and administrative functions may not proceed as we currently anticipate and could result in presently unanticipated costs or expenses including unanticipated capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally the businesses of universal century ag watson and d hales have depended on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our operating objectives for the uk and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

• the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations • the need to localize our product offerings particularly with respect to vb 2  17 

• tariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets and • exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and revenue growth rates as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

certain acquisitions in the united kingdom may be reviewed by the office of fair trade oft andor competition commission uk regulators if an inquiry is made by the uk regulators we may be required to demonstrate our acquisitions will not result or be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market based on our analysis of the relevant uk markets there can be no assurance that the uk regulators will agree with us if they decide to make an inquiry if the uk regulators determine that by our acquisitions of certain assets there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in a uk market we could be required to divest some portion of our uk assets in the event of a divestiture order by the uk regulators the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value accordingly any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture 

in the uk a significant portion of our business is conducted on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle to buyers continued operations on a principal basis will have a negative impact on our future consolidated gross margin percentages and exposes us to additional inventory risks 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions during such periods in particular the uk acquisitions because of their size and because the uk operates primarily on the principal model versus the agency model employed in north america will have a significant impact on the comparability of revenues margins and margin percentages in future periods continued operations on a principal basis will have a negative impact on our future consolidated gross margin percentages and exposes us to inventory risks including losses from theft damage and obsolescence 

our strategic shift from live sales to an entirely internetbased sales model presents risks including substantial technology risks 

during 2004 in north america and during 2008 in the uk we converted all of our sales from a live auction process to an entirely internetbased auctionstyle model based on technology developed internally by us the conversion represented a significant change in the way we conduct business and presents numerous risks including our increased reliance on the availability and reliability of our network systems in particular we believe the conversion presents the following risks among others 

• our operating results in a particular period could be adversely affected in the event our networks are not operable for an extended period of time for any reason as a result of internet viruses or as a result of any other technological circumstance that makes us unable to conduct our virtual sales • our business is increasingly reliant on internally developed technology and we have limited historic experience developing technologies or systems for largescale implementation and use 18 

• our general and administrative expenses have tended to increase as a percentage of revenue as our information technology payroll has increased • the change in our business model may make it more difficult for management investment analysts and investors to model or predict our future operating results until sufficient historic data is available to evaluate the effect of the vb 2 implementation over a longer period of time and in different economic environments • our increasing reliance on proprietary technology subjects us to intellectual property risks including the risk of third party infringement claims or the risk that we cannot establish or protect intellectual property rights in our technologies we have filed patent applications for vb 2 in the netherlands canada australia china the european union mexico and japan but we cannot provide any assurances that the patents will actually be issued or if issued that the patents would not later be found to be unenforceable or invalid our results of operations may not continue to benefit from the implementation of vb 2 to the extent we have experienced in recent periods 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary vb 2 sales technologies across our operations has had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base and increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales vb 2 was implemented across all of our north american and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 respectively we do not believe however that we will continue to experience improvements in our results of operations at the same relative rates we have experienced in the last few years in addition we cannot predict whether we will experience the same initial benefits from the implementation of vb 2 in the uk market or in future markets we may enter that we experienced in north america 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories as discussed below hurricanes katrina and rita had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the gulf coast area we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

• continue to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms • expand existing facilities in nogrowth regulatory environments 19 

• increase revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities • maintain the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions or • create new vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and profitability requirements as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

• hire train and manage additional qualified personnel • establish new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle sellers • identify and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms • secure adequate capital and • maintain the supply of vehicles from vehicle sellers our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

• fluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles • the impact of foreign exchange gain and loss as a result of our recently acquired companies in the uk • our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations in the uk and any additional international markets we may enter • the availability of salvage vehicles • variations in vehicle accident rates • member participation in the internet bidding process • delays or changes in state title processing • changes in international state or federal laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles • changes in local laws affecting who may purchase salvage vehicles • our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully • the timing and size of our new facility openings • the announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors • the severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns • the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure • the availability and cost of general business insurance • labor costs and collective bargaining 20 

• acceptance of buyers and sellers of our internetbased model deploying vb 2  a proprietary internet auctionstyle sales technology • changes in the current levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles • the introduction of a similar internet product by a competitor and • the ability to obtain necessary permits to operate due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our strategic shift to an internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

implementation of vb 2 in our operations has increased the relative importance of intellectual property rights to our business our intellectual property rights include a patent for vb 2 as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our vb 2 auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

if we experience problems with our trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our north american storage facilities we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an 

increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of our operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted further we rely on independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other shareholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 15 of our common stock as of july 31 2010 if they were to act together these shareholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders including the election of directors any amendments to our articles of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these shareholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these shareholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have a shareholder rights plan or poison pill which could affect the price of our common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest or to acquire us 

in march 2003 our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan commonly known as a poison pill the poison pill may discourage delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities initiating a tender offer or proxy contest or acquiring us through an acquisition merger or similar transaction such an acquirer could be prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chairman a jayson adair our chief executive officer and vincent w mitz our president or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

our cash investments are subject to numerous risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or an impairment to our invested cash and may have a material affect on our consolidated financial statements 

the impairment of capitalized development costs could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of new software products new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software beginning with its introduction or roll out if at any time it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be expensed in part or in full as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

increased investment in advertising and marketing could adversely impact our operating results 

in fiscal year 2010 we increased and in fiscal year 2011 we may increase our spending on advertising and marketing relative to 2009 these amounts may be material to our overall general and administrative expenses and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

new member programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member and the market maker program through which registered members can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public may involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during the year ended july 31 2006 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in gulf coast states these additional costs characterized as abnormal under fasb asc 330 inventory were recognized during the year ended july 31 2006 and included the additional 

subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices and declines in used car prices may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts or pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share results of operations and financial condition additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules 

regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws affecting the importation of salvage vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of salvage vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of salvage vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for salvage vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the united states the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing the demand for our products and services 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

volatility in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has led to an economic downturn in the us and abroad as a result of the economic downturn the number of miles driven may decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles adverse credit conditions may also affect the ability of members 

to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or remain volatile our credit facility may be affected 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations in recent periods the amount of goodwill on our balance sheet has increased substantially principally as a result of a series of acquisitions we have made in the uk since 2007 as of july 31 2010 the amount of goodwill on our balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was approximately 1759 million 

pursuant to fasb asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  we are required to annually test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in the definition of a business segment in which we operate changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations changes in competition or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization changes in these factors or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance could affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets which may result in an impairment charge for example continued deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that a goodwill impairment is required with respect to our acquisitions in the uk we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets should the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the consolidated financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board or the fasb the public company accounting oversight board and the sec from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements and consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar 

and foreign currencies primarily the british pound and canadian dollar could adversely affect our financial results 

fluctuations in the us unemployment rates could result in declines in revenue from processing insurance cars 

increases in unemployment may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle and not an insurance company is responsible for its disposition we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or if disposed disposed through channels other than us

our corporate headquarters are located in fairfield california this facility consists of approximately 100000 square feet of office space owned by copart we also own or lease an additional 152 operating facilities in the us we have facilities in every state except delaware new hampshire north dakota rhode island south dakota vermont and wyoming in canada we have facilities only in the province of ontario in the uk as of july 31 2010 we owned or leased 16 operating facilities we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations and additional offices on commercially acceptable terms 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage and handling or disposal of vehicles this litigation includes the following matter 

on november 20 2007 car auction  reinsurance solutions inc cars filed suit against copart in the superior court in the county of new castle delaware cars is seeking in excess of 2 million in damages punitive damages and prejudgment interest related to allegations involving breach of contract and misrepresentation we believe the claim is without merit and are defending the lawsuit vigorously 

on december 16 2008 liberty mutual fire insurance company filed suit against copart in the us district court northern district of california liberty mutuals complaint sought reformation of an insurance contract and specific performance in relation to a policy issued to us with a 50000 selfinsured retention after settlement of a claim under the subject policy for 395 million liberty mutual sought to reform the contract and charge us for a 2 million selfinsured retention which it claimed was the original intent pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties the case was dismissed in january 2010 

we provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when insurance is purchased

overview 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb 2  sellers are primarily insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators vehicle rental companies and the general public we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters however at certain locations we sell directly to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs in the united states and canada or north america we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the united kingdom or uk a significant portion of our business is conducted on a principal basis purchasing salvage vehicles outright from insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account 

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program or pip program where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the consignment or fixed fee program we generally 

charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs under the consignment programs only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 we converted all of our north american and uk sales respectively to an internetbased auctionstyle model using our vb 2 internet sales technology which employs a twostep bidding process the first step called the preliminary bid allows members to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual auction begins the second step allows members to bid against each other and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process in a realtime process over the internet 

acquisitions and new operations 

we have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired fourteen facilities and established twelve new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2008 all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have 152 facilities located in north america and the uk as of july 31 2010 and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2007 through july 31 2010 



 closed in fiscal 2008  former mag facility  closed in fiscal 2010 

in january 2010 the company completed the acquisition of d hales limited d hales which operated five locations in the united kingdom this acquisition was undertaken because of its strategic fit with our business in the united kingdom 

in april 2008 we completed the acquisition of simpson bros york holdings limited a uk limited liability company simpson which operated one location in york england simpsons primary business activity was the dismantling of automobiles and the sales of salvaged auto parts in the same month we also completed the acquisition of bob lowe salvage pool inc which operated one location in sikeston missouri in february 2008 we completed the purchase of the assets and business of ag watson auto salvage  motors spares scotland limited ag watson which operated two salvage locations in scotland and two salvage locations in northern england in august 2007 we completed the acquisition of century salvage sales limited century a vehicle salvage disposal company with three facilities located in the uk the total consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately 382 million in cash net of cash acquired 

on june 14 2007 we acquired all the issued share capital of universal salvage plc universal for £200 per share approximately 394 based on currency exchange rates on june 14 2007 universal based in the uk and operating exclusively within the uk is a service provider to the motor insurance and automotive industries the aggregate acquisition consideration 

paid by us totaled approximately £607 million approximately 1200 million based on currency exchange rates on june 14 2007 and was funded from our available cash resources we also assumed outstanding indebtedness of universal totaling approximately £23 million 45 million as of june 14 2007 the acquisition was our first acquisition outside north america 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it is our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and members and iv expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

revenues 

the following sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands except percentages 



service revenues service revenues were approximately 6421 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 6154 million for fiscal 2009 an increase of 268 million or 44 above fiscal 2009 the increase in service revenue was due primarily to an increase in the average revenue per car sold the increase in the revenue per car sold was driven by increased selling prices as over 50 of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle at the auction we believe the increase in the average selling price was primarily due to i an increase in commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling and ii the general increase in used car pricing which has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles that are either repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user we cannot determine the movement of these influences nor can we determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing and used car pricing had on the selling price of vehicles unit volume grew by over one percent resulting in an increase in revenue of 71 million the average dollar to pound exchange rate was 157 dollars to the pound and 159 dollars to the pound for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively and led to a reduction in service revenue of 02 million 

vehicle sales we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account vehicle sales revenues were approximately 1307 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 1277 million for fiscal 2009 an increase of 30 million or 24 above fiscal 2009 the increase in vehicle sales revenue was due to the rise in the average selling price of vehicles which resulted in increased revenue of 300 million the rise in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to i the increase in commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the general increase in used car pricing which has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles that are either repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user and iii in the uk the continuing beneficial impact of vb 2 which we introduced to the uk in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide we cannot determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the specific impact of commodity pricing and used car pricing nor can we isolate the impact that vb 2 had on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold in the uk the change in volume reflects the migration of certain contracts in the uk from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of 250 million the negative impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 20 million 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses were approximately 3202 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 3248 million for fiscal 2009 a decline of approximately 46 million or 14 below fiscal 2009 the decline was driven primarily by operational efficiencies and by reductions in subhauling costs relative to the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 when the cost of diesel fuel peaked included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 349 million and 328 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

cost of vehicle sales the cost of vehicles sold was approximately 1047 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 1060 million for fiscal 2009 a decline of approximately 14 million or 13 unit volume decline led to a reduction of 180 million and was primarily due to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee basis cost per unit sold was up and represented a 171 million increase relative to last year the negative impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 05 million 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were approximately 1089 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 869 million for fiscal 2009 an increase of approximately 220 million or 253 the growth in general and administrative costs was due primarily to i increased advertising costs as we invested in events and media promotions including nascar and nhra sponsorships to generate new member activity ii the additional costs associated with the chairman and chief executive officers noncash compensation package approved by the shareholders in april 2009 and iii increased headcount these changes increased general and administrative expenses by 86 million 61 million and 48 million respectively also included in general and administrative expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 83 million and 90 million for the years ended july 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

other income expense total other income was approximately 04 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 24 million for fiscal 2009 a decline of approximately 20 million or 823 net interest income declined 14 million due primarily to reduced interest yields other income net declined 06 million primarily due a decline in rental income of 17 million and the loss of 08 million on the sale of an airplane in the current year and was offset by a 11 million impairment of a note receivable relating to the disposal of the assets of a discontinued business and a 10 million loss on the sale of an airplane in the prior year 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were approximately 367 and 387 respectively the decrease was driven primarily by the reduction of state income taxes and the favorable tax treatment we received relating to certain interest expenses in the uk 

net income due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 1516 million for fiscal 2010 compared to net income of approximately 1411 million for fiscal 2009

revenues 

the following sets forth information on customer revenue by class in thousands except percentages 



service revenues service revenues were approximately 6154 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 6197 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of 44 million or 07 below fiscal 2008 the decline in service revenue was due to the negative impact on recorded service revenues due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate and was offset by growth in unit volume and a marginal growth in revenue per transaction the average dollar to pound exchange rate was 159 dollars to the pound and 200 dollars to the pound for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively and led to a reduction in service revenue of 95 million growth in unit volume was driven primarily by an increase in the units sold on behalf of insurance companies and units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships the growth resulted from market wins and with respect to insurance company cars from what we believe to be an increase in salvage frequency salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that are deemed total economic losses by the insurance company we believe the increased availability of such cars was as a result of lower average used car pricing the growth in unit volume generated 49 million in additional revenue relative to last year revenue yield per transaction was marginally higher as the decline in the average selling price was offset by higher yield on services provided and generated 02 million in additional revenue compared to last year over 50 of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicles we believe the decline in the average selling price was primarily due to i the recent declines in commodity and used car pricing as we believe that commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the decline in used car pricing because we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers and iii the strengthening of the dollar as we believe a stronger dollar increases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies however we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles 

vehicle sales we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account vehicle sales revenues were approximately 1277 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 1651 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of 374 million or 226 below fiscal 2008 the decline in vehicle sales revenue was due to the negative impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate the decline in unit volume and 

the decline in revenue per transaction the decline in the average usd to gbp exchange rate led to a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of 297 million the decline in unit volume lead to a reduction in revenue of 53 million and was due primarily to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee basis the decline in the average revenue per transaction led to a reduction of revenue of 23 million we believe the decline in the average selling price was primarily due to i the declines in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing particularly the price per ton for crushed car bodies has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the decline in used car pricing because we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers and iii the strengthening of the dollar as we believe a stronger dollar increases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies however we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses were approximately 3248 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 3289 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of approximately 41 million or 13 below fiscal 2008 the beneficial impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in gbp to usd exchange rate was 106 million and was offset by an increase in the cost to process each car which was driven primarily by an increase in subhauling costs in the us and the additional costs associated with five new facilities included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 328 million and 322 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

cost of vehicle sales the cost of vehicles sold was approximately 1060 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 1337 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of approximately 276 million or 207 the beneficial impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 238 million unit volume decline was responsible for 43 million of the total decline and was due primarily to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee basis cost per unit sold was up marginally and represented a 04 million increase relative to last year 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were approximately 869 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 843 million for fiscal 2008 an increase of approximately 26 million or 31 the beneficial impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in gbp to usd exchange rate was approximately 30 million the growth in general and administrative costs was due primarily to i increased it payroll and technology costs as we expanded our development and network departments ii increased advertising costs as we invested in events and media promotions to generate public awareness and iii the additional costs associated with the ceo and presidents noncash compensation package approved by the shareholders in april 2009 also included in general and administrative expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 90 million and 106 million for the years ended july 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

other income expense total other income was approximately 24 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 117 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of approximately 93 million or 795 net interest income declined 61 million due to reductions in both the average cash balances and the interest yield other income net declined 32 million primarily due to the impairment of a note receivable relating to the sale of assets of the public auction business which we exited in 2006 and the loss on the sale of an airplane in the uk together totaling 22 million currency exchange losses on certain intercompany obligations and losses on the disposition of other certain assets 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were approximately 387 and 371 respectively the increase was driven primarily by the decline in tax exempt interest income 

discontinued operations during fiscal 2009 we received a 12 million payment for a note receivable resulting from the sale of certain mag business assets and real estate we exited the mag business in our 2006 fiscal year the gain on the sale of the real estate was deferred until payment on the note receivable was received the 16 million of income from discontinued operations represents that gain net of taxes 

net income due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 1411 million for fiscal 2009 compared to net income of approximately 1569 million for fiscal 2008

our primary source of working capital is cash generated though operations potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity however with respect to the issuance of equity or debt we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and if available if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection on sellers fees members fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars totaled by the insurance companies during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

our primary source of working capital is net income accordingly factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital those primary factors i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v salvage frequency vi change in market share of our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchanges rates x product mix and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate are discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections in this form 10k 

as of july 31 2010 we had working capital of approximately 3302 million including cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2682 million cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of us treasury bills and funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at a variable rate cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 1055 million from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 39 million to 1994 million during fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009 due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 93 million to 2033 million during fiscal 2009 when compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was driven primarily by a reduction in income taxes receivable of 180 million which was offset by a decrease in net income of 158 million the remaining increase of 71 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 120 million to 1941 million during fiscal 2008 when compared to fiscal 2007 due to the increase in net income which was offset in part by the timing of routine changes in working capital items the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal 2008 

investing activities 

during the fiscal year ended july 31 2008 we purchased approximately 1544 million of shortterm investments which was offset by the sale of 2570 million of shortterm investments we historically invested our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we converted our entire balance of shortterm investments to cash and cash equivalents 

capital expenditures related to continuing operations excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were approximately 758 million 789 million and 1134 million for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations we have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2010 

during the fiscal year ended july 31 2010 we used approximately 214 million in cash for the acquisition of d hales we made no acquisitions during the fiscal year ended july 31 2009 during the fiscal year ended july 31 2008 we used approximately 382 million in cash for the acquisitions of century simpson ag watson and bob lowes salvage pool 

financing activities 

in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 we generated approximately 63 million 31 million and 127 million respectively through the exercise of stock options 

in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 we generated approximately 20 million 19 million and 17 million respectively through the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 

in fiscal 2009 we used approximately 175 million and in 2008 we generated approximately 82 million through changes in our book overdraft 

in february 2003 our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 90 million shares of our common stock in october 2007 our board of directors approved a 20 million share increase in our stock repurchase program bringing the total current number of shares authorized for repurchase to 29 million shares the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions no time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program subject to applicable securities laws such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time for the year ended july 31 2010 we repurchased 121251 shares of our common stock at a price of 3676 for the year ended july 31 2009 we did not repurchase any shares under our stock repurchase program for the year ended july 31 2008 we repurchased 6615764 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 4070 as of july 31 2010 the total number of shares repurchased under the program was 13770720 and 15229280 shares were available for repurchase under our program 

in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2009 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 mr adair chief executive officer and then president exercised stock options through cashless exercises in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 mr johnson chairman of the board exercised stock options through a cashless exercise a portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price and federal and state minimum statutory tax withholding requirements we remitted approximately 172 million to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees minimum statutory withholding requirements in fiscal year 2008 no stock options were exercised through the cashless exercise method the exercises are summarized in the following table 



1 shares withheld for taxes are treated as a repurchase of shares for accounting purposes but do not count against our stock repurchase program 

contractual obligations 

we lease certain domestic and foreign facilities and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases in addition to the minimum future lease commitments presented the leases generally require the company to pay property taxes insurance maintenance and repair costs which are not included in the table because we have determined these items are not material the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july 31 2010 in thousands 



  



1 contractual obligations consist of future noncancelable minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases used in the normal course of business 2 tax liabilities include the longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 3 commercial commitments consist primarily of letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions 

credit facilities 

on march 6 2008 we entered into an unsecured credit agreement with bank of america na the credit agreement providing for a 200 million revolving credit facility the credit facility currently available under the credit agreement is 150 million subject to a 100 million foreign currency borrowing sublimit and a 50 million letter of credit sublimit amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be used for repurchases of stock capital expenditures working capital and other general corporate purposes the credit facility matures and all outstanding borrowings are due on the fifth anniversary of the credit agreement the maturity date with annual reductions in availability of 25 million on each of the first three anniversaries of the credit agreement amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date and bear interest at our option at either eurocurrency rate plus 05 to 0875 depending on the leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement at the end of the previous quarter or at the us prime rate a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to 20 above the otherwise applicable interest rate the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility the commitment fee ranges from 0075 to 015 depending on the leverage ratio as of the end on the previous quarter the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and places certain business operating restrictions on us relating to among other things indebtedness liens and other encumbrances investments mergers and acquisitions asset sales and dividends distributions and redemptions of capital stock in addition the credit agreement provides for a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio the credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees violation of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties crossdefaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency defaults material judgments invalidity of the loan documents and events constituting a change of control the credit facility is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries the credit facility contains restrictions with respect to investments mergers and acquisitions dividends and distributions and redemptions of capital stock these restrictions become effective only after our debt to ebitda ratio exceeds 1010 at july 31 2010 the debt to ebitda ratio was less than 1010 as of july 31 2010 and july 31 2009 we did not have an outstanding balance under the credit facility 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2010 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to vehicle pooling costs selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition sharebased compensation longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our 

significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2010 the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements where appropriate we discuss sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements in accordance with fasb asc 60525 revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  which addresses accounting for multipleelement arrangements and revenue recognition for units of accounting 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the sellers behalf and under most of our current north american contracts collecting the proceeds from the member we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the member for the seller and accordingly we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection net of applicable rebates or allowances 

vehicle sales where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf are recognized in accordance with asc 60525 on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the member and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

in certain cases seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the member however we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items as a result we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered which generally occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the member for the seller 

we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of asc 60525 to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multielement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale and the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 

we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our members or sellers 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor transportation and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs 

are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of fasb asc 3301035 inventory subsequent measurement to our vehicle pooling costs asc 3301035 requires that items such as idle facility expense excessive spoilage double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as provided in asc 3301035 in addition asc 3301035 requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance ie total writeoffstotal accounts receivable writeoff percentage we note that a one percentage point deviation in the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of less than 01 million 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our north america and uk operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc 740 income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada and uk in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2010 we had approximately 08 million of valuation allowance arising from the net operating losses in states where we had discontinued certain operations in prior years and the potential losses if certain capital assets are sold in the uk to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated income statement 

historically our income taxes have been sufficiently provided to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors including i the geographical allocation of our 

future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations as a result we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 

based on our results for the twelve months ended july 31 2010 a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately 24 million 

effective august 1 2007 we adopted fasb asc 7401025 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement 

although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service and us states we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method as required by asc 718 compensation—stock compensation  asc 718 requires that the compensation cost related to sharebased payment transactions measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued be recognized in the financial statements determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the grant date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000 deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which is 150000 per claim in addition each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies is approximately 48 million as of july 31 2010 if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our medical expense would change by approximately 10 million and our medical accrual would change by approximately 200000 if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our workers compensation expense would change by approximately 100000 and our accrual for workers compensation expenses would change by 100000 a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than 25000 

segment reporting 

our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk 

interest rate risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets as of july 31 2010 all of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits us treasury bills and money market funds as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2010 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held during the twelve months ended july 31 2010 a 10 change in our interest yield would not materially affect our operating results we do not hedge interest rate fluctuation risks 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues result from transactions by our canadian and uk operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar and the british pound our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility accordingly our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and british pound in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decreaseincrease to revenue of approximately 171 million for the twelve months ended july 31 2010 there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous as a result the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect income 

fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2010 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of approximately 327 million this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar or the british pound will not have a material affect on our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb 2  sellers are primarily insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators vehicle rental companies and the general public we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters and at certain locations we sell directly to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 

in the us and canada or north america we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate primarily on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle for our own account 

during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 we converted all of our north american and uk sales respectively to our internet based auctionstyle selling platform which we call vb 2  this technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 s bid4u feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access 

we believe the implementation of vb 2 has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles we also believe that it has improved the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated with live auctions for fiscal 2009 sales of north american vehicles on a unit basis to buyers registered outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for 468 of total vehicles sold 253 of vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 215 were sold to out of country buyers based on registration for fiscal 2009 sales of uk vehicles on a unit basis to buyers registered outside the country where the vehicle is located accounted for 184 of total vehicles sold 

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

• providing coverage that facilitates seller access to buyers around the world reducing towing and thirdparty storage expenses offering a local presence for vehicle inspection stations and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by speciallytrained teams • providing a comprehensive range of customer services that include merchandising services efficient title processing timely pickup and delivery of vehicles and internet sales • establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions • increasing the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and convenience of internet bidding • applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through internet bidding webbased order processing salvage value quotes electronic communication with buyers and sellers vehicle imaging and an online used vehicle parts locator service and • providing the venue for insurance customers through our virtual insured exchange vix product to contingently sell a vehicle through the auction process to establish its true value allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles historically we believe our business has grown as a result of i acquisitions ii increases in the overall volume in the salvage car market iii growth in market share iv increases in amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of valueadded services for both buyers and sellers and v the growth in noninsurance company sellers for fiscal year 2009 which ended july 31 2009 our revenues were approximately 7431 million and our operating income was approximately 2253 million

in fiscal 2008 we initiated two new programs i copart dealer services cds by which we sell dealertradeins using our vb 2 application and ii copartdirect whereby we sell cars on behalf of the general public using our vb 2 application so that individuals can avoid the inconvenience of selling the cars themselves our goal through these two programs is to expand vb 2 s application beyond traditional salvage in order to expand our customer base cds targets franchise and independent dealerships while copartdirect targets the general public

industry overview 

the auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool in north america sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on consignment either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion in north america and on a primary basis in the uk companies in our industry will purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers insurance companies and resell the vehicles for their own account the vehicles are usually purchased at a price based either on a percentage of the vehicles estimated preaccident cash value andor based on the extent of damage vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and delivered to the buyer while most companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction copart sells all of its vehicles on its internet selling platform vb 2  thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process in the uk all sales were converted to vb 2 during fiscal 2008 

although there are other sellers of vehicles such as banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators vehicle rental companies and the general public the primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies 

automobile manufacturers are incorporating new standard features including unibody construction passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic components airbags xenon lights computer systems heated seats and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes this may result in an increased supply of total loss salvage vehicles from insurance companies 

the primary buyers of the vehicles are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers exporters and in some states the general public vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

the majority of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident typically the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance companys adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicles mileage options and condition in order to estimate its preaccident value pav or actual cash value acv the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjusters estimate of repair costs vehicles salvage value and the pav or acv as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the preaccident value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle 

we believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include 

• the anticipated percentage return on salvage ie gross salvage proceeds minus vehicle handling and selling expenses divided by the actual cash value • the services provided by the company and the degree to which such services reduce administrative costs and expenses • the price the company charges for its services 5 

• national coverage and ability to respond on a national scale • the ability to provide analytical data to the seller and • in the uk the actual amount paid for the vehicle in the uk insurance companies generally tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles the insurance company will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles 

generally upon receipt of the pick up order the assignment we arrange for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle seller we will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers to obtain the vehicles release from a towing company vehicle repair facility or impound facility advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle or invoiced separately to the seller 

the salvage vehicle then remains in storage at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate states motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv in the us total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale for our own account 

generally sellers of nonsalvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations at that time the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online the vehicle is then sold either at a live auction or in our case on vb 2 typically within 7 days proceeds are then collected from the buyer seller fees are subtracted and the remainder is remitted to the seller

flexible vehicle processing programs 

at the election of the seller we sell vehicles pursuant to our percentage incentive program pip consignment program or purchase program 

percentage fee consignment our percentage incentive program is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle sellers under pip we agree to sell all of the vehicles of a seller in a specified market usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price because our revenues under pip are directly linked to the vehicles sale price we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return we provide the vehicle seller at our expense with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility and dmv document and title processing in addition we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather washing vehicle exteriors vacuuming vehicle interiors cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires making keys for drivable vehicles and identifying drivable vehicles we believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of the vehicles thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle sellers and us 

consignment program under our consignment program we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs 

purchase program under the purchase program we purchase vehicles from a vehicle seller at a formula price based on a percentage of the vehicles estimated preaccident value pav or actual cash value acv and sell the vehicles for our own account we have no purchase programs in north america

sales process 

we offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles we utilize vb 2  an auctionstyle sales methodology that we developed this technology and model employs a twostep bidding process the first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to ebay buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 s bid4u feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf during all steps of the auction preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of a second bidding step an internetonly virtual auction this second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the highest preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in real time then bid4u submits bids for the highest preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access 

copartfinder 

copartfinder is our unique internet search engine that enables users to locate used vehicle parts quickly and efficiently copartfinder is accessible by the public through a copartsponsored website copartfinder lists vehicles recently sold through vb 2 and identifies certain purchasers this allows vehicle dismantlers and other resellers to streamline their parts sale process and access a large pool of potential buyers parts buyers can use copartfinder to search for specific vehicle makes and models and view digital images of vehicles that meet their requirements once a specific parts seller is identified for a specific part requirement buyers have the option to call fax or email the dismantlerseller we believe that copartfinder provides an incentive for vehicle dismantlers to purchase their salvage vehicles through our sales process

seller marketing 

we process vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle sellers state farm insurance company accounted for 10 of our revenues during fiscal year 2007 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues during fiscal years 2009 or 2008 of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 we obtained approximately 83 83 and 84 respectively from insurance company sellers our arrangements with our sellers are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle sellers the agreements are customized to each vehicle sellers particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle seller in a designated geographic area 

we market our services to vehicle sellers through an inhouse sales force and independent agents that utilize a variety of sales techniques including targeted mailing of our sales literature telemarketing followup personal sales calls internet search engines employee referrals tow shop referrals participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions we market our services to the general public under copartdirect by utilizing an inhouse sales force and we market our services to franchise and independent dealerships through a group of independent agents we may when appropriate provide vehicle sellers with detailed analysis of the net return on vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses 

buyers 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair licensee used vehicle dealer and export industries we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing buyers with a variety of programs and services to become a registered buyer and gain admission to one of our sales prospective buyers must first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee provide requested personal and business information and have in most states a vehicle dismantlers dealers resale repair or export license in certain venues we may sell to the general public registration entitles a buyer to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements however nonregistered buyers may transact business at any of our sales via a registered broker who meets the local licensing and permitting requirements a buyer may also bring guests to a facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale strict admission procedures are intended 

to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale we market to buyers on the internet and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and nonsalvage vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in north america include kar holdings inc formerly adesa inc and insurance auto auctions inc auction broadcasting company and manheim auctions the largest national dismantler is lkq corporation lkq in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies entirely in the uk our principal competitors are privately held independent remarketers 

management information systems 

our primary management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business operating software that we developed and which tracks salvage sales vehicles throughout the sales process we have implemented our proprietary business operating software at all of our storage facilities in addition we have integrated our mainframe computer system with internet and intranet systems in order to provide secure access to our data and images in a variety of formats 

our auctionstyle service product vb 2  is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required our sale internet and imaging services are load balanced across different geographical data centers 

we have invested in a production data center that is designed to run the business in the event of an emergency the facilitys electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored this facility is located in an area considered to be free of weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes 

as of july 31 2008 our uk operations were completely migrated to our proprietary business operating software and servers described above 

employees 

as of july 31 2009 we had 2713 fulltime employees of whom approximately 480 were engaged in general and administrative functions and approximately 2233 were engaged in yard operations as of july 31 2009 we had 2253 and 460 employees located in north america and the uk respectively we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good 

environmental matters 

our operations inside and outside the us are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oils and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination certain of our facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in aboveground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must 

be disposed of as nonhazardous or hazardous waste as appropriate we have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities and we have initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional capital expenditures 

in connection with the acquisition of the dallas texas facility in 1994 we set aside 30 million to cover the costs of environmental remediation stabilization and related consulting expenses for a sixacre portion of the facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former operators we began the stabilization process in 1996 and completed it in 1999 we paid all remediation and related costs from the 30 million fund and in accordance with the acquisition agreement distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller of the dallas facility less 02 million which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the nofurtheraction letter in september 2002 our environmental engineering consultant issued a report which concludes that the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized the leadimpacted soil and that the concrete cap should prevent impact to storm water and subsequent surface water impact our consultant thereafter submitted an operations and maintenance plan plan to the texas commission on environmental quality tceq providing for a twoyear inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap and a twoyear ground and surface water monitoring plan in january of 2003 the tceq approved the plan subject to the additions of upstream background surface water samples from the intermittent stream adjacent to the facility and documentation of any repairs to the concrete cap during the post closuremonitoring period the first semiannual water sampling was conducted in april 2003 which reflected that the leadimpacted stabilized soil is not impacting the ground andor surface water the second round of semiannual water samples collected in october and november 2003 reported concentration of lead in one storm water and one surface water sample in excess of the established upstream criteria for lead in correspondence which we received in july 2004 the tceq approved with comment our water monitoring report dated february 24 2004 the tceq instructed us to continue with postclosure monitoring and maintenance activities and submit the next report in accordance with the approved schedules in february 2005 a report from our environmental engineering consultant was transmitted to the tceq containing the results of annual monitoring activities consisting of two 2 semiannual sampling events which occurred in apriljune 2004 and octobernovember 2004 laboratory analytical results indicated no lead concentrations exceeding the target concentration level set in the corrective measures study for the site but some results were in excess of texas surface water quality standards our environmental engineering consultant concluded in the february 2005 report to the tceq that it is unlikely that lead concentrations detected in the storm water runoff samples are attributable to the lead impacted soils based on the results of the 2004 samplings we requested that no further action be taken and that a closure letter be issued by the tceq in september 2007 the tceq notified us that they did not concur with our consultants conclusions and recommendations the tceq said it would not provide a closure letter until additional sampling of surface water is performed which reflects concentrations of lead below texas surface water quality standards in february 2008 the tceq provided comments to our proposal for surface water sampling in march 2008 our environmental engineer submitted to the tceq an addendum to the surface water sampling plan which was approved by the tceq in june 2008 sampling was performed in november 2008 in december 2008 a report was submitted to the tceq indicating that lead levels were below texas surface water quality standards in may of 2009 the tceq approved the surface water sampling report as well as the concrete cap inspection report submitted in december 2008 we are making necessary repairs to the concrete cap and providing a survey map of the cap annual inspections of the cap will be required to ensure its maintenance there is no assurance that we may not incur future liabilities if the stabilization process proves 

ineffective or if future testing of surface or ground water reflects concentrations of lead which exceed texas surface or ground water quality standards 

we do not believe that the above environmental matter will either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and international motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

legal proceedings 

we are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage and handling or disposal of vehicles this litigation includes the following matters 

on november 20 2007 car auction  reinsurance solutions inc cars filed suit against copart in the superior court in the county of new castle delaware cars is seeking in excess of 2 million in damages punitive damages and prejudgment interest related to allegations involving breach of contract and misrepresentation we believe the claim is without merit and we are vigorously defending the lawsuit

we provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that the ultimate liability if any will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed or that our insurers will not seek to deny or limit coverage additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when insurance is purchased

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weather related accidents 




 item 1a risk factors 

  investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialized the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec before deciding to purchase any shares of our common stock 

we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

historically a limited number of vehicle sellers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues seller arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a substantial vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates during fiscal 2009 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenues 

our acquisitions in the uk expose us to risks arising from the acquisitions and risks associated with operating in markets outside north america we may acquire additional companies in the uk or other countries in europe or seek to establish new yards or facilities to complement the acquired companies operations we have limited experience operating outside north america and any failure to integrate these recently acquired companies or future uk or other european acquisitions into our operations successfully could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

during fiscal 2007 we completed the acquisition of universal salvage plc or universal our first acquisition in the uk in fiscal 2008 we completed the acquisitions of century salvage sales limited or century simpson bros york holdings limited and ag watson auto salvage  motor spares scotland limited all located within the uk we may continue to acquire additional companies or operations in the uk or other countries in europe or may seek to establish new yards or operations in the uk or europe now that we have established a presence in these markets we have limited experience operating our business outside north america which presents numerous strategic operational and financial risks to us 

our acquisitions in the uk and continued expansion of our operations outside north america pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we experienced losses associated with credit card fraud in the uk although historical practice in the uk market has been to accept credit cards we have not accepted them in north america and may need to further enhance our security systems to reduce the risk of credit card fraud in addition our 

operating expenses were adversely affected in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 by incremental integration expenses we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in the uk or europe among other things we have deployed our vb 2 online vehicle auction technologies at all of our operations in the uk and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology integration and integration of financial and administrative functions may not proceed as we currently anticipate and could result in presently unanticipated costs or expenses including unanticipated capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally 

we have limited experience operating our business outside north america and lack familiarity with local laws regulations and business practices we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally the businesses of universal century and ag watson have depended on key seller relationships and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our operating objectives for the uk and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

• the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations • the need to localize our product offerings particularly with respect to vb 2  • tariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets and • exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk which we have not been previously subject to in any material amounts and which had an adverse impact on our revenues and revenue growth rates during the twelve months ended july 31 2009 as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired we could incur significant charges that would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 

goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of assets acquired in business combinations in recent periods the amount of goodwill on our balance sheet has increased substantially principally as a result of a series of acquisitions we have made in the uk since 2007 as of july 31 2009 the amount of goodwill on our balance sheet subject to future impairment testing was approximately 166 million 

pursuant to sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to annually test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred additionally interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future 

performance and cash flows as well as other assumptions these estimates can be affected by numerous factors including changes in the definition of a business segment in which we operate changes in economic industry or market conditions changes in business operations changes in competition or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization changes in these factors or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance could affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets which may result in an impairment charge for example continued deterioration in worldwide economic conditions could affect these assumptions and lead us to determine that a goodwill impairment is required with respect to our acquisitions in the uk we cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets should the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could result in our incurring net losses in future periods 

in the uk we operate primarily on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle to buyers continued operations on a principal basis will have a negative impact on our future consolidated gross margin percentages and exposes us to additional inventory risks 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions during such periods in particular the uk acquisitions because of their size and also because the uk operates primarily on the principal model versus the agency model employed in north america will have a significant impact on the comparability of revenues margins and margin percentages in future periods continued operations on a principal basis will have a negative impact on our future consolidated gross margin percentages and exposes us to inventory risks including 

• loss from theft or damage • loss from devaluation and • loss from obsolescence our strategic shift from live sales to an entirely internetbased sales model presents risks including substantial technology risks 

during 2004 in north america and during 2008 in the uk we converted all of our sales from a live auction process to an entirely internetbased auctionstyle model based on technology developed internally by us the conversion represented a significant change in the way we conduct business and currently presents numerous risks including our increased reliance on the availability and reliability of our network systems in particular we believe the conversion presents the following risks among others 

• our operating results in a particular period could be adversely affected in the event our networks are not operable for an extended period of time for any reason as a result of internet viruses or as a result of any other technological circumstance that makes us unable to conduct our virtual sales • our business is increasingly reliant on internally developed technology and we have limited historic experience developing technologies or systems for largescale implementation and use • our general and administrative expenses have tended to increase as a percentage of revenue as our information technology payroll has increased • the change in our business model may make it more difficult for management investment analysts and investors to model or predict our future operating results until sufficient historic 19 

data is available to evaluate the effect of the vb 2 implementation over a longer period of time and in different economic environments 

• our increasing reliance on proprietary technology subjects us to intellectual property risks including the risk of third party infringement claims or the risk that we cannot establish or protect intellectual property rights in our technologies we have filed patent applications for vb 2 in the netherlands canada australia china the european union mexico and japan but we cannot provide any assurances that the patents will actually be issued or if issued that the patents would not later be found to be unenforceable or invalid our results of operations may not continue to benefit from the implementation of vb 2 to the extent we have experienced in recent periods 

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary vb 2 sales technologies across our operations has had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base and increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales vb 2 was implemented across all of our north american and uk salvage yards beginning in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 respectively we do not believe however that we will continue to experience improvements in our results of operations at the same relative rates we have experienced in the last few years in addition we cannot predict whether we will experience the same initial benefits from the implementation of vb 2 in the uk market or in future markets we may enter that we experienced in north america 

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles 

capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories as discussed below hurricanes katrina and rita had in certain quarters an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the gulf coast area we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in 

addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during the year ended july 31 2006 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in gulf coast states these additional costs characterized as abnormal under statement of financial accounting standards 151 were recognized during the year ended july 31 2006 and included the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices declines in commodity prices and declines in used car prices may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues revenue growth rates if any and operating results significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts or pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results recently the markets in which we operate have been particularly affected by changes in fuel prices commodity prices and decreases in the prices of used cars in particular declines in scrap metal and used car prices had an adverse impact on our revenue growth rates during the twelve months ended july 31 2009 continued volatility in fuel commodity and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle sellers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service 

providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share results of operations and financial condition additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of additional facilities and the development of new facilities there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

• continue to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms • expand existing facilities in nogrowth regulatory environments • increase revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities • maintain the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions or • create new vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and profitability requirements as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

• hire train and manage additional qualified personnel • establish new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle sellers • identify and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms • secure adequate capital and • maintain the supply of vehicles from vehicle sellers our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

• fluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles • the impact of foreign exchange gain and loss as a result of our recently acquired companies in the uk • our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations in the uk and any additional international markets we may enter • the availability of salvage vehicles • variations in vehicle accident rates • buyer participation in the internet bidding process • delays or changes in state title processing 22 

• changes in international state or federal laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles • changes in local laws affecting who may purchase salvage vehicles • our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully • the timing and size of our new facility openings • the announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors • the severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns • the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure • the availability and cost of general business insurance • labor costs and collective bargaining • the availability of subhaulers at competitive rates • acceptance of buyers and sellers of our internetbased model deploying vb 2  a proprietary internet auctionstyle sales technology • changes in the current levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles • the introduction of a similar internet product by a competitor and • the ability to obtain necessary permits to operate due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our strategic shift to an internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

implementation of vb 2 in our operations has increased the relative importance of intellectual property rights to our business our intellectual property rights include a patent for vb 2 as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights in addition we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our vb 2 auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions in our north american operations as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property 

rights claims against us grows litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

changes in laws affecting the importation of salvage vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our internetbased auctionstyle model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base as a result foreign importers of salvage vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base changes in laws and regulations that restrict the importation of salvage vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for salvage vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base for example in march 2008 a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the united states the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing the demand for our products and services 

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make adjustments to accounting policies that could adversely affect the financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board or the fasb the public company accounting oversight board the sec and other accounting organizations or governmental entities from time to time issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that require changes to our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but future pronouncements or interpretations could require a change or changes in our policies or procedures 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely effect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience problems with our trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our north american storage facilities we also utilize to a lesser extent independent subhaulers in the uk our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

in addition to using independent subhaulers in the uk we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles from our uk storage facilities in connection therewith we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends our results of our operations could be harmed 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted further we rely on independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other shareholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 16 of our common stock as of july 31 2009 if they were to act together these shareholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders 

including the election of directors any amendments to our articles of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these shareholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these shareholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have a shareholder rights plan or poison pill which could affect the price of our common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest or to acquire us 

in march 2003 our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan commonly known as a poison pill the poison pill may discourage delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities initiating a tender offer or proxy contest or acquiring us through an acquisition merger or similar transaction such an acquirer could be prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chief executive officer and a jayson adair our president or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

our cash investments are subject to numerous risks 

we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities which may include us treasuries other federal state and municipal debt bonds preferred stock commercial paper insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded all securities are subject to risk including fluctuations in interest rates credit risk market risk and systemic economic risk changes or movements in any of these risk factors may result in a loss or an impairment to our invested cash and may have a material affect on our financial statements 

the recent financial crisis and economic downturn may negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for over a year which has led to an economic downturn in the us and abroad as a result of the ongoing financial crisis and economic downturn the number of miles driven may continue to decrease which may lead to fewer accident claims a reduction of vehicle repairs and fewer salvage vehicles adverse credit conditions may also affect the ability of buyers to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand in addition if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or remain volatile our banking institution may reduce our line of credit 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 

our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements and consequently foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings should we choose to engage in 

hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will not exceed their benefits fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies primarily the british pound and canadian dollar could adversely affect our financial results 

investment in nascar sponsorships and other advertising could impact our operating results 

we have in fiscal 2009 and will continue in fiscal 2010 to invest in advertising and sponsorship programs with nascar and other events in the motorsports industry we may expend amounts that are material to our overall general and administrative expenses and we cannot predict what future benefits if any will be derived 

new buyer programs could impact our operating results 

we have or will initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered buyer and the market maker program through which registered buyers can open copart storefronts with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public may involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit if any will be derived

we provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty we maintain insurance which may or may not provide coverage for claims made against us there is no assurance that there will be insurance coverage available when and if needed or that our insurers will not seek to deny or limit coverage additionally the insurance that we carry requires that we pay for costs andor claims exposure up to the amount of the insurance deductibles negotiated when insurance is purchased

overview 

we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb 2  sellers are primarily insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions charities car dealerships fleet operators vehicle rental companies and the general public we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters however at certain locations we sell directly to the general public the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs in the united states and canada or north america we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the united kingdom or uk we operate primarily on a principal basis purchasing salvage vehicles outright from insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account 

our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue purchased vehicle revenues and other remarketing services revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program or pip program where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the fixed fee program we generally charge an 

additional fee for title processing and special preparation although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs under the consignment programs only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage loading and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 we converted all of our north american and uk sales respectively to an internetbased auctionstyle model using our vb 2 internet sales technology this process employs a twostep bidding process the first step called the preliminary bid allows buyers to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual auction begins the second step allows buyers to bid against each other and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process in a realtime process over the internet 

acquisitions and new operations 

we have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired twenty three facilities and established thirteen new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2006 all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have 147 facilities located in north america and the uk and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2006 through july 31 2009 



 closed in fiscal 2008  former mag facility in april 2008 we completed the acquisition of simpson bros york holdings limited a uk limited liability company simpson which operates one location in york england simpsons primary business activity was the dismantling of automobiles and the sales of salvaged auto parts in the same month we also completed the acquisition of bob lowe salvage pool inc which operates one location in sikeston missouri in february 2008 we completed the purchase of the assets and business of ag watson auto salvage  motors spares scotland limited ag watson which operates two salvage locations in scotland and two salvage locations in northern england in august 2007 we completed the acquisition of century salvage sales limited century a vehicle salvage disposal company with three facilities located in the uk the total consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately 382 million in cash net of cash acquired 

on june 14 2007 we acquired all the issued share capital of universal salvage plc or universal for £200 per share approximately 394 based on currency exchange rates on june 14 2007 universal based in the uk and operating exclusively within the uk is a service provider to the motor insurance and automotive industries the aggregate acquisition consideration paid by us totaled approximately £607 million approximately 1200 million based on currency exchange rates on june 14 2007 and was funded from our available cash resources we also assumed outstanding indebtedness of universal totaling approximately £23 million 45 million as of june 14 2007 the acquisition was our first acquisition outside north america and included the seven facilities discussed above 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account it is our intention where possible to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 

in addition to growth through acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and buyers and iv expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income presented in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

revenues 

the following sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands except percentages 



service revenues service revenues were approximately 6154 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 6197 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of 44 million or 07below fiscal 2008 the decline in service revenue was due to the negative impact on recorded service revenues due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate and was offset by growth in unit volume and a marginal growth in revenue per transaction the average dollar to pound exchange rate was 159 dollars to the pound and 200 dollars to the pound for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively and lead to a reduction in service revenue of 95 million growth in unit volume was driven primarily by an increase in the units sold on behalf of insurance companies and units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships the growth resulted from market wins and with respect to insurance company cars from what we believe to be an increase in salvage frequency 

salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that are deemed total economic losses by the insurance company we believe the increased availability of such cars was as a result of lower average used car pricing the growth in unit volume generated 49 million in additional revenue relative to last year revenue yield per transaction was marginally higher as the decline in the average selling price was offset by higher yield on services provided and generated 02 million in additional revenue compared to last year over 50 of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicles we believe the decline in the average selling price was primarily due to i the recent declines in commodity and used car pricing as we believe that commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the decline in used car pricing because we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers and iii the strengthening of the dollar as we believe a stronger dollar increases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies however we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles 

vehicle sales we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account vehicle sales revenues were approximately 1277 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 1651 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of 374 million or 226 below fiscal 2008 the decline in vehicle sales revenue was due to the negative impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate the decline in unit volume and the decline in revenue per transaction the decline in the average usd to gbp exchange rate lead to a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of 297 million the decline in unit volume lead to a reduction in revenue of 53 million and was due primarily to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee basis the decline in the average revenue per transaction lead to a reduction of revenue of 23 million we believe the decline in the average selling price was primarily due to i the declines in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing particularly the price per ton for crushed car bodies has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the decline in used car pricing because we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers and iii the strengthening of the dollar as we believe a stronger dollar increases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies however we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses were approximately 3248 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 3289 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of approximately 41 million or 13 below fiscal 2008 the beneficial impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in gbp to usd exchange rate was 106 million and was offset by an increase in the cost to process each car which was driven primarily by an increase in subhauling costs in the us and the additional costs associated with five new facilities included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 328 million and 322 million for the fiscal years ended july 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

cost of vehicle sales the cost of vehicles sold was approximately 1060 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 1337 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of approximately 276 million or 207 the beneficial impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was 238 million unit volume decline was responsible for 43 million of the total decline and was due primarily to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee 

basis cost per unit sold was up marginally and represented a 04 million increase relative to last year 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were approximately 869 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 843 million for fiscal 2008 an increase of approximately 26 million or 31 the beneficial impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in gbp to usd exchange rate was approximately 30 million the growth in general and administrative costs was due primarily to i increased it payroll and technology costs as we expanded our development and network departments ii increased advertising costs as we invested in events and media promotions to generate public awareness and iii the additional costs associated with the ceo and presidents non cash compensation package approved by the shareholders in april 2009 also included in general and administrative expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which were 90 million and 106 million for the years ended july 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

other income expense total other income was approximately 24 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 117 million for fiscal 2008 a decline of approximately 93 million or 795 net interest income declined 61 million due to reductions in both the average cash balances and the interest yield other income net declined 32 million primarily due to the impairment of a note receivable relating to the sale of assets of the public auction business which we exited in 2006 and the loss on the sale of an airplane in the uk together totaling 22 million currency exchange losses on certain intercompany obligations and losses on the disposition of other certain assets 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were approximately 387 and 371 respectively the increase was driven primarily by the decline in tax exempt interest income 

discontinued operations during fiscal 2009 we received a 12 million payment for a note receivable resulting from the sale of certain mag business assets and real estate we exited the mag business in our 2006 fiscal year the gain on the sale of the real estate was deferred until payment on the note receivable was received the 16 million of income from discontinued operations represents that gain net of taxes 

net income due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 1411 million for fiscal 2009 compared to net income of approximately 1569 million for fiscal 2008 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

revenues 

the following sets forth information on customer revenue by geographic region based on the location of the selling entity in thousands except percentages 



service revenues service revenues were approximately 6197 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 5358 million for fiscal 2007 an increase of 839 million or 157 over fiscal 2007 the growth in revenue came from an increase in units sold and an increase in revenue per transaction the growth in units sold came from acquisitions primarily in the uk market share wins and the development of noninsurance markets and represented 597 million of the increase and 

service revenue yield represented 242 million of the total increase growth in revenue yield per transaction was primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of the vehicles over 50 of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicles we believe the increase in the average selling price was due primarily to i the increases in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling ii the increase in used car pricing as we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers iii the weakening of the dollar as we believe a weaker dollar decreases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies and iv the decline in salvaged cars sold as a percentage of total cars sold as salvaged cars generally sell for less than nonsalvaged cars however we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap dismantling retailing or export and accordingly cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles 

vehicle sales vehicle sales revenues were approximately 1651 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 249 million for fiscal 2007 an increase of 1402 million or 5635 over fiscal 2007 the increase was due almost entirely to the uk acquisitions in which we assumed certain contracts that required us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account in north america we have no contracts in which we are required to purchase the vehicle from the seller 

yard operation expenses yard operation expenses from continuing operations were approximately 3289 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 2715 million for fiscal 2007 an increase of 574 million or 211 over fiscal 2007 yard operating expenses in the uk excluding depreciation increased by 496 million as we made our first acquisition in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and accordingly had a full year of expenses in fiscal 2008 in north america excluding depreciation yard operating expenses grew by 63 million due primarily to increased volume included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which grew by 15 million to 322 million due primarily to increased amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in the uk 

cost of vehicles sales the cost of vehicles sold was approximately 1337 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 224 million for fiscal 2007 an increase of 1113 million or 4974 over fiscal 2007 the increase was due primarily to the uk acquisitions in which we assume certain contracts that require us to act as a principal purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately 843 million for fiscal 2008 compared to 636 million for fiscal 2007 an increase of approximately 207 million or 325 over fiscal 2007 the increase came primarily from the additional management finance technology systems and administrative resources required to support international operations increased resources required to accelerate the development and deployment of the enhancements to vb 2 and to our seller support software and interfaces and the incremental costs associated with the uk integration included in general and administrative expenses is depreciation and amortization of 106 million an increase of 49 million over fiscal 2007 and includes amortization expenses relating to intangible assets acquired as part of the uk acquisitions 

other income total other income was approximately 117 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 143 million for fiscal 2007 a decline of approximately 25 million or 178 over fiscal 2007 interest income declined 60 million due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash and investment balance net other income increased approximately 13 million equity in loss 

of unconsolidated entity reflected a 22 million write down in fiscal 2007 to the carrying value of our investment in lanelogic corporation lanelogic 

income taxes our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2008 and 2007 were approximately 371 and 373 respectively 

net income due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 1569 million for fiscal 2008 compared to net income of approximately 1363 million for fiscal 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of working capital is cash generated though operations potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity however with respect to the issuance of equity or debt we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and if available if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection on sellers fees buyers fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently the number of cars totaled by the insurance companies during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

because our primary source of working capital is net income factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital those primary factors i seasonality ii market wins and losses iii supplier mix iv accident frequency v salvage frequency vi change in market share of our existing suppliers vii commodity pricing viii used car pricing ix foreign currency exchanges rates x product mix and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate are discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections in this form 10k 

as of july 31 2009 we had working capital of approximately 2123 million including cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1627 million cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at a variable rate cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 1237 million from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 

we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 93 million to 2033 million during fiscal 2009 when compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was driven primarily by a reduction in income taxes receivable of 180 million which was offset by a decrease in net income of 158 million the remaining increase of 71 million is due to routine changes in working capital items 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 120 million to 1941 million during fiscal 2008 when compared to fiscal 2007 due to the increase in net income which was offset in part by the timing of routine changes in working capital items the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 408 million to 1821 million during fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006 due to the increase in net income which was offset in part to the timing of routine changes in working capital items the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal 2007 and the loss on discontinued operations in the amount of 179 million in fiscal 2006 which did not recur in fiscal 2007 

investing activities 

during the fiscal years ended july 31 2008 and 2007 we purchased approximately 1544 million and 9218 million respectively of shortterm investments which were offset by the sale of 2570 million and 9679 million respectively of shortterm investments we historically invested our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we converted our entire balance of shortterm investments to cash and cash equivalents 

capital expenditures related to continuing operations excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were approximately 790 million 1134 million and 768 million for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our capital expenditures are primarily related to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations we have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of july 31 2009 

during the fiscal year ended july 31 2008 we used approximately 382 million in cash for the acquisitions of century salvage sales limited simpson bros york ltd ag watson auto salvage and motor spares scotland limited and bob lowes salvage pool during the fiscal year ended july 31 2007 we used approximately 1200 million in cash for the acquisition of universal which includes the following seven locations in the uk sandy sandtoft sandwich westbury chester denny and wootton

and other general corporate purposes the credit facility matures and all outstanding borrowings are due on the fifth anniversary of the credit agreement with annual reductions in availability of 25 million on each of the first three anniversaries of the credit agreement amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date and bear interest at our option at either eurocurrency rate plus 05 to 0875 depending of the leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement at the end of the previous quarter or at the prime rate a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to 20 above the otherwise applicable interest rate the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility the commitment fee ranges from 0075 to 015 depending on the leverage ratio as of the end on the previous quarter the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and places certain business operating restrictions on us relating to among other things indebtedness liens and other encumbrances investments mergers and acquisitions asset sales and dividends distributions and redemptions of capital stock in addition the credit agreement provides for a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio the credit facility contains events of default that include among others nonpayment of principal interest or fees violation of covenants inaccuracy of representations and warranties crossdefaults to certain other indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency defaults material judgments invalidity of the loan documents and events constituting a change of control the credit facility is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries the credit facility contains restrictions with respect to investments mergers and acquisitions dividends and distributions and redemptions of capital stock these restrictions become effective only after the companys debt to ebitda ratio exceeds 1010 at july 31 2009 the debt to ebitda ratio was less than 1010 as of july 31 2009 we did not have an outstanding balance under the credit facility 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of july 31 2009 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to vehicle pooling costs selfinsured reserves allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes revenue recognition sharebased compensation longlived asset impairment calculations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2009 the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements where appropriate we discuss sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 0021 which addresses accounting for multipleelement arrangements and staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 which addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the sellers behalf and under most of our current north american contracts collecting the proceeds from the buyer we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and accordingly we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection 

vehicle sales where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf are recognized in accordance with sab 104 on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the buyer and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

in certain cases seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer however we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items as a result we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered which generally occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller 

we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of eitf 0021 to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multielement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale and the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 

we also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our buyers or sellers 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor transportation and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 151 inventory costs sfas 151 to our vehicle pooling costs sfas 151 requires that items such as idle facility expense excessive spoilage double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as currentperiod charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as provided in accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 inventory pricing  in addition sfas 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or buyers and the inability of our sellers or buyers to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our sellers or buyers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance ie total writeoffstotal accounts receivable writeoff percentage we note that a one percentagepoint deviation in the writeoff percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of less than 01 million 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our north america and uk operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no109 accounting for income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the us canada and uk in arriving at a provision of income taxes we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities such as various accruals depreciation and amortization the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as of july 31 2009 we had approximately 03 million of valuation allowance arising from the net operating losses in states where we had discontinued certain operations in prior years to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated income statement 

historically our income taxes have been sufficiently provided to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate nonetheless our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by the following factors including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations as a result we routinely 

assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 

based on our results for the twelve months ended july 31 2009 a one percentagepoint change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately 22 million 

effective august 1 2007 we adopted financial interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement 

although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service and us states we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method as required by sfas no 123r sharebased payment  sfas no 123r requires that the compensation cost related to sharebased payment transactions measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued be recognized in the financial statements determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the grant date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers compensation and auto liability our insurance policies are subject to a 250000 deductible per claim with the exception of our medical policy which is 150000 per claim in addition each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows could be impacted the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances the total amount reserved for all policies is approximately 58 million as of july 31 2009 if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10 we estimate that our medical expense would change by approximately 10 million and our medical accrual would change by approximately 200000 if our total payroll changed by 10 we estimate that our workers compensation expense would change by approximately 100000 and our accrual for workers compensation expenses would change by 100000 a 10 change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than 25000 

segment reporting 

our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 

recently issued accounting standards 

for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk foreign currency risk and translation risk 

interest rate risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets as of july 31 2009 all of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments as of july 31 2009 we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagedbacked securities based on the average cash balance held during the twelve months ended july 31 2009 a 10 change in our interest yield would not materially affect our operating results we do not hedge interest rate fluctuation risks 

foreign currency and translation exposure 

fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries international net revenues result from transactions by our canadian and uk operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency the canadian dollar and the british pound our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility accordingly our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and british pound in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decreaseincrease to revenue of approximately 152 million for the twelve months ended july 31 2009 there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous as a result the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect income 

fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period at july 31 2009 the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of approximately 271 million this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income a 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar or the british pound will not have a material affect on our consolidated financial position 

we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

general 

copart inc is a leading provider of vehicle remarketing services in the united states us and the united kingdom uk 

we provide vehicle suppliers primarily insurance companies with a full range of remarketing services to process and sell salvage vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auctionstyle sales technology which we refer to as vb 2  we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of remarketing services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs in the us we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from sales transaction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage in the uk we operate primarily on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle to buyers through a combination of live auctions and internet sales we intend to implement vb 2 at our uk facilities where appropriate during fiscal 2008

we have grown our salvage business through a combination of acquisitions the development of new facilities and also by increasing our buyer base and implementing additional valueadded services for both buyers and suppliers for fiscal year 2007 which ended july 31 2007 our revenues were approximately 5607 million and our operating income was approximately 2031 million on june 14 2007 we acquired universal salvage plc or universal universal based in the uk operates seven salvage yards in the uk and is a leading provider of vehicle remarketing services to the motor insurance and automotive industries universal specializes in the disposal of accidentdamaged endoflife feebased nonsalvage vehicles on august 1 2007 we acquired century salvage sales limited or century in the uk century operates three salvage yards in the uk during the fiscal year ended july 31 2007 we opened three new salvage vehicle storage facilities located in baltimore maryland woodburn oregon and punta gorda florida during the year we also closed one facility located in grand island nebraska as of july 31 2007 we had 123 facilities in the us 1 facility in canada and 7 facilities in the uk 

during fiscal 2004 we converted all of our north american salvage vehicle storage facilities to an internet based auctionstyle model using vb 2  this second generation technology combines two bidding processes an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 ’s bid4u feature will 

incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internetonly virtual sale bid4u will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internetonly virtual sale this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access

we believe the implementation of vb 2 across our north american salvage operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles from us we also believe that it has improved the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated with live auctions for fiscal 2007 sales of north american vehicles on a unit basis to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for 508 of total vehicles sold 251 of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 257 were sold to out of country buyers based on registration as we integrate our recent uk acquisitions we intend to implement vb 2 at our uk facilities where appropriate we can not predict whether the implementation of vb 2 in the uk will have the same favorable impact on our buyer base and operating efficiencies that we experienced in the us

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the salvage vehicle sales and remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by 

·   providing coverage that facilitates supplier access to buyers around the world reducing towing and thirdparty storage expenses offering a local presence for vehicle inspection stations and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by speciallytrained teams

·   providing a comprehensive range of customer services that include merchandising services efficient title processing timely pickup and delivery of vehicles and internet sales

·   establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions

·   increasing the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and convenience of internet bidding

·   applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through internet bidding webbased order processing salvage value quotes electronic communication with buyers and sellers vehicle imaging and an electronic used vehicle parts locator service and

·   providing the venue for insurance customers through our virtual insured exchange “vix” product to enter a vehicle into a live virtual sale to establish its true value allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles

we adopted a formal plan in fiscal 2006 to discontinue the operations of motors auction group or mag a wholly owned subsidiary and dispose of the related assets or convert them to our salvage business we operated six public automobile sales facilities located in detroit michigan chesapeake virginia new castle delaware greencastle pennsylvania pittsburgh pennsylvania and richmond virginia we sold the businesses located in chesapeake new castle and greencastle prior to the end of fiscal 2006 we converted detroit pittsburgh and richmond into salvage facilities as of the end of fiscal 2006 no mag operations remained

the salvage vehicle industry provides a venue for salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate total loss vehicles in the united states and canada salvage vehicle sales companies generally auction or sell salvage vehicles on consignment either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion in the us and canada and on a primary basis in the uk salvage sales companies will purchase vehicles from vehicle suppliers at a formulabased price based usually either on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated preloss actual cash value andor based on the extent of damage and sell the vehicles for their own account salvage vehicle sales companies typically operate from one or more salvage facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and sold however in the united states and canada copart through the introduction of vb 2  eliminated local live auctions and we now sell all of our salvage vehicles over the internet in the uk copart sells vehicles though a combination of live auctions and internet sales

although there are other suppliers of salvage vehicles such as financial institutions vehicle leasing companies automobile rental companies charities and automobile dealers the primary source of salvage vehicles is insurance companies 

automobile manufacturers are incorporating new standard features including unibody construction passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic components airbags xenon lights computer systems heated seats and navigation systems we believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and accordingly more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes this could result in an increasing supply of total loss salvage vehicles in the future 

the primary buyers of salvage vehicles are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of salvage vehicle buyers either dismantle a vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

following an accident involving an insured vehicle the damaged vehicle is generally towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its actual cash value fair market value the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs and the vehicle’s salvage value as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the actual cash value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a salvage vehicle sales company settle with the insured vehicle owner and receive title to the vehicle 

we believe the primary factors that vehicle suppliers consider when selecting a salvage vehicle sales company include 

·   the anticipated percentage return on salvage ie gross salvage proceeds minus vehicle handling and selling expenses divided by the actual cash value

·   the services provided by the salvage vehicle sales company and the degree to which such services reduce administrative costs and expenses

·   the price the salvage vehicle sales company charges for its services

·   national coverage and ability to respond on a national scale

·   the ability to generate custom seller reports and

·   in the uk the percentage of the actual cash value paid for the vehicle

in the uk insurance companies generally tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles the salvage company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles will generally be awarded the contract 

generally upon receipt of the pick up order the assignment the salvage vehicle sales company arranges for the transport of a vehicle to a facility in north america as a service to the vehicle supplier the salvage vehicle sales company will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle suppliers to obtain the subject vehicle’s release from a towing company or vehicle repair facility typically advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered upon sale of the salvage vehicle 

the vehicle then remains in storage at our facility until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency or dmv generally total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company of for our own account depending on the terms of the contract in the uk upon release of interest by the vehicle owner the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale

proven ability to acquire and integrate acquisitions 

we have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle storage facilities since becoming a public company in 1994 we have completed the acquisition of 74 salvage vehicle storage facilities both in north america and the uk as part of our acquisition and integration strategy we seek to 

·   expand our global presence

·   strengthen our networks and access new markets

·   utilize our existing corporate and technology infrastructure over a larger base of operations and

·   introduce our comprehensive services and operational expertise

we strive to integrate all new facilities when appropriate into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle suppliers we work with new suppliers to implement our fee structures and new service programs we typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain knowledge about and respond to the local market we also assign a special integration team to help convert newly acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary software systems enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and sales systems 

technology to enhance and expand our business 

we have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering our proprietary software programs provide vehicle suppliers with online access to data and reports regarding their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our facilities this technology allows vehicle suppliers to monitor each stage of our salvage vehicle sales process from pick up to sale and settlement by the buyer our full range of internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimizes the administrative and processing costs for us as well as our suppliers we believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients resulting in high client retention and allow us to expand our national supply contracts 

our service offerings 

we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of vehicle remarketing services which expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process maximizing proceeds and minimizing costs not all service offerings are available in all markets 

online supplier access 

through copart access our internetbased service for vehicle suppliers we enable suppliers to assign vehicles for sale check sales calendars view vehicle images and history view and reprint body shop invoices and towing receipts and view the historical performance of the vehicles sold at our sales 

salvage estimation services 

we offer copart proquote a proprietary service that assists suppliers in the vehicle claims evaluation process by providing online salvage value estimates which helps suppliers determine whether to repair a particular vehicle or deem it a total loss 

estimating services 

we offer vehicle suppliers in the uk estimating services for vehicles taken to our sites estimating services provide our insurance company suppliers repair estimates which allows the insurance company to determine if the vehicle is a total loss vehicle if the vehicle is determined to be a total loss it is assigned to inventory 

endoflife vehicle processing 

in the uk universal is an authorized treatment facility or atf for the disposal of endoflife vehicles or elvs 

virtual insured exchange vix 

we provide the venue for insurance customers to enter a vehicle into a live virtual auctionstyle sale to establish its true value thereby allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles 

transportation services 

we maintain contracts with thirdparty vehicle transport companies which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers’ vehicles within 24 hours our national network and transportation capabilities provides cost and time savings to our vehicle suppliers and ensures ontime vehicle pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters in north america in the uk we perform transportation services primarily utilizing our employees and our fleet of over 100 vehicles 

vehicle inspection stations 

we offer certain of our major insurance company suppliers office and yard space to house vehicle inspection stations onsite at our storage facilities we have over 30 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities an onsite vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company suppliers with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles which reduces storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility 

ondemand reporting 

we provide vehicle suppliers with ondemand reports online via fax or email that summarize data on salvage vehicles that we process for the particular supplier these reports track our vehicle suppliers’ gross and net returns on each vehicle service charges and other data that enable our vehicle suppliers to more easily administer and monitor the salvage vehicle disposition process in addition we have developed a database containing over 240 fields of realtime and historical information accessible by our insurance customers allowing for their generation of custom ad hoc reports and customer specific analysis 

dmv processing 

we have extensive expertise in dmv document and title processing for salvage vehicles we have developed a computer system which provides a direct link to the dmv computer systems of several states this allows us to expedite the processing of vehicle title paperwork 

flexible vehicle processing programs 

at the election of the vehicle supplier we sell vehicles pursuant to our percentage incentive program pip consignment program or purchase program 

percentage fee consignment   our percentage incentive program is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle suppliers under pip we agree to sell all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle supplier in a specified market usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price because our revenues under pip are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return on salvage vehicles we provide the vehicle supplier at our expense with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility storage for up to 90 days and dmv document and title processing in addition we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather washing vehicle exteriors vacuuming vehicle interiors cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires making keys for drivable vehicles and identifying drivable vehicles we believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of salvage vehicles thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle suppliers and us

consignment program   under our consignment program we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs

purchase program under the purchase program we purchase vehicles from a vehicle supplier at a formula price based on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated preaccident value pav or “actual cash value” acv and sell the vehicles for our own account

buyer network 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair resale and exporting businesses our database includes each buyer’s vehicle preference and purchasing history this data enables us to notify via email prospective buyers throughout the world of salvage vehicles available for bidding that match their vehicle preferences listings of salvage vehicles to be sold on a particular day and location are also made available on the internet 

sales process 

we offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles we utilize vb 2  an auctionstyle sales methodology that we developed this second generation technology combines two bidding processes an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the three preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and our bid4u feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internetonly virtual sale bid4u will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internetonly virtual sale this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access

copartfinder 

copartfinder is our unique internet “search engine” that enables users to locate used vehicle parts quickly and efficiently copartfinder is accessible by the public through a copartsponsored website copartfinder lists vehicles recently sold through vb 2 and identifies certain purchasers this allows vehicle dismantlers and other resellers to streamline their parts sale process and access a large pool of potential buyers parts buyers can use copartfinder to search for specific vehicle makes and models and view digital images of vehicles that meet their requirements once a specific parts supplier is identified for a specific part requirement buyers have the option 

to call fax or email the dismantlersupplier we believe that copartfinder provides an incentive for vehicle dismantlers to purchase their salvage vehicles through our sales process 

supply arrangements and supplier marketing 

we obtain salvage vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle suppliers state farm insurance company accounted for 11 14 and 12 of our revenues for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively of the total number of vehicles that we processed in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 we obtained approximately 83 83 and 79 respectively from insurance company suppliers our arrangements with our suppliers are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle suppliers the agreements are customized to each vehicle supplier’s particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle supplier in a designated geographic area 

we market our services to vehicle suppliers through an inhouse sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques including targeted mailing of our sales literature telemarketing followup personal sales calls and participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions based upon our historical data on salvage vehicles and vehicle information supplied by vehicle suppliers our marketing personnel will provide vehicle suppliers with detailed analysis of the net return on salvage vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on salvage vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses 

buyers 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair resale and export businesses we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing buyers of salvage vehicles with a variety of programs and services to gain admission to one of our sales and become a registered buyer prospective buyers must first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee provide requested personal and business information and have in most states a vehicle dismantler’s dealer’s resale repair or export license in certain venues we may sell to the public registration entitles a buyer to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements a buyer may also bring guests to a facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale we market to buyers on the internet and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle suppliers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in north america include the adesa corporation auction broadcasting company insurance auto auctions inc manheim auctions and sadisco the largest national dismantlers include greenleaf and lkq corporation these national dismantlers in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing vehicle sales companies entirely including us in the uk our principal competitors are privately held independent salvage companies 

management information systems 

our primary management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business operating software that we developed and which tracks salvage sales vehicles throughout the sales process we have implemented our proprietary business operating software at all of our north american salvage storage facilities in addition we have integrated our mainframe computer system with internet and intranet systems in order to provide secure access to our data and images in a variety of formats 

our auctionstyle service product vb 2  is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required our sale internet and imaging services are load balanced across different geographical data centers

we have invested in a production data center that is designed to run the business in the event of an emergency the facility’s electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored this facility is located in an area considered to be free of weatherrelated disasters and earthquakes 

the management information systems employed in the uk are a combination of proprietary and licensed software and are independent and separate from those in north america 

employees 

as of july 31 2007 we had 2536 fulltime employees of whom approximately 381 were engaged in general and administrative functions and approximately 2155 were engaged in yard operations as of july 31 2007 we had 2198 and 338 employees located in north america and the uk respectively we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good 

environmental matters 

our operations inside and outside the us are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oils and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination certain of our facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in aboveground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be disposed of as nonhazardous or hazardous waste as appropriate we have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities and we have initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance if additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future we could incur additional capital expenditures 

in connection with the acquisition of our dallas texas facility in 1994 we set aside 30 million to cover the costs of environmental remediation stabilization and related consulting expenses for a sixacre portion of the facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former operators we began the stabilization process in 1996 and completed it in 1999 we paid all remediation and related costs from the 30 million fund and in accordance with the acquisition agreement distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller of the dallas facility less 02 million which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the nofurtheraction letter in september 2002 our environmental engineering consultant issued a report which concludes that the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized the leadimpacted soil and that the concrete cap should prevent impact to storm water and subsequent surface water impact our consultant thereafter submitted an operations and maintenance plan “plan” to the texas commission on environmental quality “tceq” providing for a twoyear inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap and a twoyear ground and surface water monitoring plan in january of 2003 the tceq approved the plan subject to the additions of upstream background surface water samples from the intermittent stream adjacent to the facility and documentation of any repairs to the concrete cap during the post closuremonitoring period the first semiannual water sampling was conducted in april 2003 which reflected that the leadimpacted stabilized soil is not impacting the ground andor surface water the second round of semiannual water samples collected in october and november 2003 reported concentration of lead in one storm water and one surface water sample in excess of the established upstream criteria for lead in correspondence which we received in july 2004 the tceq approved with comment our water monitoring report dated february 24 2004 the tceq instructed us to continue with postclosure monitoring and maintenance activities and submit the next report in accordance with the approved schedules in february 2005 a report from our environmental engineering consultant was transmitted to the tceq containing the results of annual monitoring activities consisting of two 2 semiannual sampling events which occurred in apriljune 2004 and octobernovember 2004 laboratory analytical results indicated no lead concentrations exceeding the target concentration level set in the corrective measures study 

for the site but some results were in excess of texas surface water quality standards the company’s environmental engineering consultant concluded in the february 2005 report to the tecq that it is unlikely that lead concentrations detected in the storm water runoff samples are attributable to the lead impacted soils based on the results of the 2004 samplings we requested that no further action be taken and that a closure letter be issued by the tceq in september 2007 the tceq notified us that they did not concur with our consultant’s conclusions and recommendations the tceq said it would not provide a closure letter until additional sampling of surface water is performed which reflects concentrations of lead below texas surface water quality standards this sampling is anticipated to be performed in september or october 2007 we are not assured of receiving the nofurtheraction letter and we may incur further liabilities if the stabilization process proves ineffective or if later testing of surface or ground water reflects concentrations of lead which exceed texas surface or ground water quality standards in addition in 1994 we detected a small quantity of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater monitoring well at the dallas facility our environmental consultants concluded that both substances arose from an offsite source and no further action was recommended 

we do not believe that any of the above environmental matters will either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal national international provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state provincial and international motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

legal proceedings 

we are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage and handling or disposal of vehicles this litigation includes the following matters 

on september 16 2005 richard m gray filed suit against copart of connecticut inc and a safrin in the state court for the county of chatham state of georgia alleging a class action for unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by us and related claims relief sought includes class certification damages fees costs and expenses our motion for summary judgment was heard on january 31 2007 and was denied we believe the claim is without merit and are defending the lawsuit vigorously 

on july 28 2006 foreign car sales and service llc “fcs” filed suit against copart in the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana originally alleging antitrust violations and unfair trade practices relief sought originally included class certification based on both unfair trade practices and sherman act violations damages fees costs and expenses on january 5 2007 the magistrate required fcs to amend its complaint a first amended complaint was rejected and a second amended complaint was submitted february 16 2007 in which fcs abandoned its unfair trade practices claims and now relies simply on breach of contract claims fcs continues to seek certification of a class based upon violations of the sherman act plaintiff is in pro se and is demanding a total award of 51 of our issued stock as well as approximately 97000 in damages arising from damages to vehicles we filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction improper venue and failure to state a claim we believe the claims are without merit and are defending the lawsuit vigorously 

on august 7 2006 kimberly and jason green filed suit against copart in the superior court of the state of california county of sacramento making allegations pursuant to a california consumer protection statute similar to a class action for unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by us and related claims relief sought includes class certification damages fees costs and expenses we filed an answer on september 1 2006 denying the claim on july 2 2007 the parties entered into a settlement agreement terminating the lawsuit 

we accrue for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty 

intellectual property and proprietary rights 

in june 2003 we filed a provisional us patent application on vb 2 in the united states this provisional patent application was followed by a us utility application filed in july 2003 and a concurrent international application that has since been nationalized and is pending in canada australia china the european union mexico and japan generally patents issued in the us are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law we are not dependent upon any single patent application and there can be no assurance that any patents will be issued from pending applications or that any patents that are issued will provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantages to us

we also rely on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products in seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors 




 item 1a   risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialized the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedule and other filings with the sec before deciding to purchase any shares of our common stock 

we depend on a limited number of major suppliers of salvage vehicles the loss of one or more of these major suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

historically a limited number of vehicle suppliers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues in fiscal 2007 vehicles supplied by our largest supplier accounted for approximately 11 of our revenues supplier arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice vehicle suppliers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle suppliers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle supplier or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a substantial vehicle supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our united kingdom acquisition of universal salvage plc on june 14 2007 and our subsequent acquisition of century salvage sales limited on august 1 2007 will expose us to risks arising from the acquisitions and risks associated with operating in markets outside north america we may acquire additional companies in the united kingdom or europe or seek to establish new yards or facilities to complement the acquired companies’ operations we have no prior experience operating outside north america and any failure to integrate these recently acquired companies or future uk or european acquisitions into our operations successfully could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

during fiscal 2007 we announced the acquisition of universal salvage plc or universal our first acquisition in the uk subsequently in august 2007 we announced the acquisition of century salvage sales limited or century also in the uk we may acquire additional companies or operations in the uk or europe or may seek to establish new yards or operations in the uk or europe now that we have established a presence in these markets we have no experience operating our business outside north america which presents numerous strategic operating and financial risks to us 

our recent acquisitions in the uk and continued expansion of our operations outside north america pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results in particular we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business we may also incur substantial expenses establishing new yards or operations in the uk or europe among other things we intend to eventually deploy our vb 2 vehicle remarketing technologies at all of our operations in the uk where appropriate and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance integration of our respective operations including information technology integration and integration of financial and administrative functions may not proceed as we currently anticipate and could result in presently unanticipated costs or expenses including unanticipated capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results we cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally

we have no experience operating our business outside north america and lack familiarity with local laws regulations and business practices we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale operationally the businesses of universal and century have depended on key customer and supplier relationships and we will need to maintain those if we fail to maintain those relationships it would have an adverse effect on our operating objectives for the uk and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in addition we anticipate our international operations will subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis including 

·   the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations

·   the need to localize our product offerings particularly with respect to vb 2 

·   tariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets and

·   exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk which we have not been previously subject to in any material amounts

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions during such periods in particular the uk acquisition because of its size and also because the uk operates primarily on the principal model versus the agency model employed in the us will have a significant impact on the comparability of revenues margins and margin percentages in future periods further operating on a principal basis will have a negative impact on our future consolidated gross margins 

in the uk we operate primarily on a principal basis purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle to buyers this exposes us to inventory risks including 

·   loss from theft or damage

·   loss from devaluation and

·   loss from obsolescence

our strategic shift from live salvage sales to an entirely internetbased sales model presents new risks including substantial technology risks 

in fiscal 2004 we converted all our north american salvage sales from a live auction process to an entirely internetbased auctionstyle model based on technology developed internally by us the conversion represents a significant change in the way we conduct business and presents numerous risks including our increased reliance on the availability and reliability of our network systems in particular we believe the conversion presents the following risks among others 

·   our operating results in a particular period could be adversely affected in the event our networks are not operable for an extended period of time for any reason as a result of internet viruses or as a result of any other technological circumstance that makes us unable to conduct our virtual sales

·   our business is increasingly reliant on internally developed technology and we have limited historic experience developing technologies or systems for largescale implementation and use

·   our general and administrative expenses have tended to increase as a percentage of revenue as our information technology payroll has increased

·   the change in our business model may make it more difficult for management investment analysts and investors to model or predict our future operating results until sufficient historic data is available to evaluate the effect of the vb 2 implementation over a longer period of time and in different economic environments

·   our increasing reliance on proprietary technology subjects us to intellectual property risks including the risk of third party infringement claims or the risk that we cannot establish or protect intellectual property rights in our technologies we have filed patent applications for vb 2 in the united states the netherlands and europe but we cannot provide any assurances that the patents will actually be issued or if issued that the patents would not later be found to be unenforceable or invalid

our results of operations may not continue to benefit from the implementation of vb 2 to the extent we have experienced in recent periods

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary vb 2 sales technologies across our north america salvage operations has had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base and increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales vb 2 was implemented across all our salvage yards beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 we do not believe however that we will continue to experience improvements in our results of operations at the same relative rates we have experienced in the last few years in addition we cannot predict whether we will experience the same initial benefits from the implementation of vb 2 in the uk market or in future markets we may enter that we experienced in north america

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our salvage yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage vehicles 

capacity at our salvage yards varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories as discussed below hurricanes katrina and rita had an adverse effect on our operating results in part because of yard capacity constraints in the gulf coast area we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent salvage yards in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles conversely extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands 

mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle suppliers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections in addition extreme weather conditions although they increase the available supply of salvage cars can have an adverse effect on our operating results for example during the year ended july 31 2006 we recognized substantial additional costs associated with the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in gulf coast states these additional costs characterized as “abnormal” under statement of financial accounting standards 151 were recognized during the year ended july 31 2006 and included the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes in the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets those conditions could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

high fuel prices may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our percentage incentive program contracts or pip the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we will not be able to pass on to our suppliers of salvage vehicles a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other vehicle remarketing companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other suppliers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large 

dismantlers certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle suppliers particularly in the uk the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our suppliers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of salvage vehicle remarketing facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle suppliers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share results of operations and financial condition additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new salvage vehicle facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle facilities and the development of new salvage vehicle facilities there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

·   continue to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms

·   expand existing facilities in nogrowth regulatory environments

·   increase revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities

·   maintain the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions or

·   create new salvage vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and profitability requirements

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to manage growth is not only dependent on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

·   hire train and manage additional qualified personnel

·   establish new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle suppliers

·   identify and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms

·   secure adequate capital and

·   maintain the supply of vehicles from vehicle suppliers

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

·   fluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles

·   as a result of our recently acquired companies in the uk the impact of foreign exchange gain and loss

·   our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations in the uk and any additional international markets we may enter

·   the availability of salvage vehicles

·   variations in vehicle accident rates

·   buyer participation in the internet bidding process

·   delays or changes in state title processing

·   changes in international state or federal laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles

·   changes in local laws affecting who may purchase salvage vehicles

·   our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully

·   the timing and size of our new facility openings

·   the announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors

·   severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns

·   the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure

·   the availability and cost of general business insurance

·   labor costs and collective bargaining

·   availability of subhaulers at competitive rates

·   acceptance of buyers and sellers of our internetbased model deploying vb 2  a proprietary internet auctionstyle sales technology including in the uk market where we still sell salvage vehicles using live auctions

·   changes in the current levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles

·   the introduction of a similar internet product by a competitor and

·   the ability to obtain necessary permits to operate salvage storage facilities

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our strategic shift to an internetbased sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

implementation of vb 2 across our north american salvage operations has increased the relative importance of intellectual property rights to our business our intellectual property rights include pending patent applications for vb 2   as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights we are in the process of prosecuting an initial patent application relating to vb 2   and cannot predict whether a patent will actually issue from that application even if a patent is issued the scope of the protection gained may be insufficient or any issued patent could subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable in addition we are increasingly entering into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our vb 2   auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions in our north american operations as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to make changes or adjustments in our accounting policies and procedures that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the sec or other accounting organizations or governmental entities issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but future pronouncements or interpretations could require us to change our policies or procedures moreover we continually review our critical accounting policies in light of the accounting literature and changes in our operations 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types 

of regulations by federal national international provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to federal state national  provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage facilities in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil in the uk we provide vehicle depollution and crushing services for endoflife program vehicles we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience problems with our providers of fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our north american storage facilities our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers 

if we experience problems with our uk trucking fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we use a fleet of company owned trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our uk storage facilities we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services including inclement weather disruptions in transportation infrastructure availability and price of fuel any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical insurance general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted further we rely on independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other shareholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 20 of our common stock as of july 31 2007 if they were to act together these shareholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders including the election of directors any amendments to our articles of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these shareholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these shareholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have a shareholder rights plan or poison pill which could affect the price of our common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest or to acquire us 

in march 2003 our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan commonly known as a poison pill the poison pill may discourage delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities initiating a tender offer or proxy contest or acquiring us through an acquisition merger or similar transaction such an acquirer could be prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chief executive officer and a jayson adair our president or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives

our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues consignment revenues from suppliers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling the vehicles regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or under our percentage incentive program or pip program our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price under the fixed fee program we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs under the consignment programs only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue not the actual sales price gross proceeds salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under certain contracts transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and primarily generated in the uk 

operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel equipment maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts because we operate as a principal in the uk purchasing and reselling salvaged vehicles for our own account we expect operating costs to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

during fiscal 2004 we converted all of our north american vehicle remarketing facilities to an internetbased auctionstyle model using our vb 2 internet sales technology this process employs a twostep bidding process the first step called the preliminary bid allows buyers to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual action begins the second step allows buyers to bid against each other and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process in a realtime process over the internet

during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we adopted a formal plan to discontinue the operations of our public auction business motors auction group or mag and dispose of or convert the related assets the mag yards converted into salvage facilities will continue to be included in the results of continuing operations on the income statements 

acquisitions and new operations 

we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired sixteen vehicle storage facilities and established fourteen new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2005 all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle suppliers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities as part of this strategy in fiscal 2007 we acquired seven new facilities in the uk located in sandy sandtoft sandwich westbury chester denny and wootton and in north america we opened new facilities in baltimore maryland woodburn oregon and punta gorda florida in fiscal 2006 we acquired new facilities in or near greenwood nebraska grand island nebraska york haven pennsylvania chambersburg pennsylvania altoona pennsylvania fruitland maryland billings montana and opened new facilities in or near honolulu hawaii lansing michigan dover florida and jacksonville florida in fiscal 2005 we acquired new facilities in or near lexington kentucky and columbia missouri and opened new facilities in strongsville ohio ocala florida knoxville tennessee loganville georgia spokane washington tallahassee florida and hialeah florida we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have 131 facilities located in north america and the united kingdom and are able to provide national coverage for our suppliers 

on june 14 2007 we acquired all the issued share capital of universal salvage plc or universal for £200 per share approximately 394 based on currency exchange rates on june 14 2007 universal based in the uk and operating exclusively within the uk is a service provider to the motor insurance and automotive industries the aggregate acquisition consideration paid by us totaled approximately £607 million approximately 1200 million based on currency exchange rates on june 14 2007 and was funded from our available cash resources we also assumed outstanding indebtedness of universal totaling approximately £23 million 45 million as of june 14 2007 the acquisition marks our first acquisition outside north america and includes the seven facilities discussed above 

the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods in particular the uk acquisition because of its size and also because the uk operates primarily on the principal model versus the agency model employed in the united states will have a significant impact on the comparability of revenues and gross margin percentages in future periods 

in addition to growth through acquisitions we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers and iv expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

the following sets forth information on general and administrative expenses and shown as a percentage of revenue by geographic region in thousands except percentages 

 

  

other income   total other income was approximately 143 million during fiscal 2007 an increase of approximately 113 million from fiscal 2006 the increase is due primarily to a 55 million increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and a higher average cash and investments balance and a decrease of 46 million in losses from an equity investment in lanelogic corporation “lanelogic” other income which consists primarily of rental income and gain on the sales of assets increased approximately 12 million

income taxes   our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2007 and 2006 were approximately 373 and 354 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of fiscal 2006 including a nonrecurring 18 million outofperiod reduction to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense originating primarily in 2001 and prior years

discontinued operations   discontinued operations declined 157 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006 as we discontinued our mag operations and disposed of or converted all the related assets during fiscal 2006 there were no such disposals in fiscal 2007

net income   due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 1363 million for fiscal 2007 compared to net income of approximately 969 million for fiscal 2006

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

revenues   revenues from continuing operations were approximately 5286 million during fiscal 2006 an increase of approximately 808 million or 181 over fiscal 2005 the increase was due primarily to increased vehicle unit volume driven by the additional salvage vehicles associated with hurricanes katrina and rita growth in vehicles processed at existing yards and vehicles processed from new yards opened or acquired in fiscal 2006 existing facilities contributed approximately 713 million of the revenue growth and new facilities in or near honolulu hawaii greenwood nebraska grand island nebraska york haven pennsylvania chambersburg pennsylvania altoona pennsylvania fruitland maryland lansing michigan and billings montana contributed approximately 95 million of new revenue growth

yard operation expenses   yard operation expenses from continuing operations were approximately 2980 million during fiscal 2006 an increase of approximately 524 million or 213 over fiscal 2005 included in yard expenses is depreciation expense of 269 million an increase of 03 million over fiscal 2005 yard operation expenses increased to 564 of revenues during fiscal 2006 as compared to 549 of revenues during fiscal 2005 the increases in yard expenses were primarily attributable to the cost of handling increased volume a general increase in subhauling costs and the incremental abnormal costs incurred as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita these additional inventorytype costs were approximately 141 million in fiscal 2006 and were charged to yard operations in accordance with sfas 151 these costs include the additional subhauling payroll equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes these costs do not include normal expenses associated with the increased unit volume created by the hurricanes which are deferred until the sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2006 approximately 28 of the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes remained unsold and in inventory and were subsequently disposed of in fiscal 2007 the processing of the hurricane vehicles has had and may continue to have a negative impact on gross and operating margin percentages

general and administrative   general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately 590 million during fiscal 2006 an increase of approximately 134 million or 293 over 

fiscal 2005 the increase was primarily due to increases in telecommunication costs information technology payroll costs costs relating to sarbanesoxley compliance sfas 123r stock compensation costs and outside legal expense associated with a patent litigation matter that was settled during fiscal 2006 and other pending litigation and general corporate expansion general and administrative expenses increased to 112 of revenues during fiscal 2006 as compared to 102 of revenues during fiscal 2005 the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects in part changes in the nature of our business in particular the introduction of vb 2 resulted in a reduction in certain yard operation expenses relating to conducting live auctions but increased our general and administrative expenses as we continued to make technology infrastructure investments and hire additional personnel to enhance and maintain vb 2 and other products for use in our auctions

other income   total other income was approximately 30 million during fiscal 2006 a decrease of approximately 52 million from fiscal 2005 the decrease was due primarily to a 68 million loss recognized from an equity investment in an unconsolidated privatelyheld entity this loss was offset by an increase in interest income of approximately 33 million due to higher interest rates and a higher average cash and investments balance other income which consists primarily of rental income and gain on the sales of nonfleet assets decreased approximately 17 million resulting from losses on disposals of fixed assets

income taxes   our effective combined federal state and local income tax rates for fiscal 2006 and 2005 was approximately 354 and 381 respectively the decrease in effective tax rate is primarily the result of recording a nonrecurring 18 million outofperiod reduction to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense originating primarily in 2001 and adjustments to our state tax reserves based on the favorable outcome of an audit

discontinued operations   during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we adopted a formal plan to discontinue the operations of our public auction business motors auction group mag and dispose of or convert the related assets the mag yards to be converted into salvage facilities will continue to be included in the results of continuing operations on the income statements

under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair valuebased test or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present the discontinuation of an operating segment is one of those indicators accordingly goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 as of the second quarter of 2006 we used a combination of valuation techniques which included consideration of marketbased approaches and an income approach in determining the fair value of our applicable reporting unit in the interim impairment test of goodwill 

in fiscal 2006 the impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the mag goodwill exceeded its implied fair value the corresponding writedown of goodwill of 218 million to its fair value was reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income we also determined that the value of the remaining mag covenants not to compete were impaired and recorded an 

impairment expense in the amount of 05 million this writedown of covenants not to compete is also reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we sold the business and related assets of one of the mag locations for approximately 01 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we sold the business and related assets including the real estate of one of the mag locations we received a 12 million promissory note from the buyer as purchase consideration the promissory note bears interest at 7 per annum interest only payments on the note are due monthly until maturity on may 28 2011 at which time the balance of the note is due in full the note receivable is collateralized by the real estate and is personally guaranteed by the buyer the consideration was allocated to the real estate based on an appraisal and to the business in proportion to their estimated fair values the portion of the consideration allocated to the real estate sale totaled 71 million we deferred a gain on the sale of the real estate of approximately 25 million that will be recognized upon payment of the principal balance of the note receivable the remaining consideration of 49 million is allocated to the sale of the business we recognized a gain on the sale of the business of approximately 30 million which is included in the results of the discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we sold the business and related assets excluding the real estate of another mag location we received a 12 million promissory note and 02 million in cash from the buyer as purchase consideration we recognized a gain on the sale of the business of approximately 13 million which is included in the results of discontinued operations as of july 31 2006 no mag locations remained three of the original six mag locations were sold and three were converted into salvage facilities 

net income   due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 969 million for fiscal 2006 compared to net income of approximately 1021 million for fiscal 2005

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing cash and cash equivalents combined with shortterm investments decreased by approximately 743 million from july 31 2006 to july 31 2007 primarily as a result of cash used for the acquisition of universal purchases of property and equipment and repurchases of common stock which was offset by cash generated from continuing operations during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased seasonal volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers’ fees buyers’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of sold vehicles 

as of july 31 2007 we had working capital of approximately 2479 million including cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of approximately 2010 million during the course of the year we invest substantially all of our cash balances in aaa rated auction rate securities auction rate securities are principally variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of 90 days auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction at 

predetermined shortterm intervals usually every 7 28 or 35 days they trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction although these instruments are issued and rated as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm securities because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset 

we believe that our currently available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 401 million to 1821 million during fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006 due to the increase in net income which was offset in part to the timing of routine changes in working capital items the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal 2007 and the loss on discontinued operations in the amount of 179 million in fiscal 2006 which did not recur in fiscal 2007 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 60 million to 1419 million during fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2006 we consumed cash through the growth in accounts receivable and vehicle pooling costs and we generated cash through the growth in deferred revenue the movements in these accounts are driven primarily by the significant growth in vehicles held for sale which was impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita the decrease in net income is primarily a result of the loss on discontinued operations in the amount of 179 million which was offset in part by increased revenue 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 209 million to 1360 million during fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the increase in net income which was offset in part to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

investing activities 

during the fiscal years ended july 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we purchased approximately 9218 million 7171 million and 7554 million respectively of shortterm investments which were offset by the sale of 9679 million 5684 million 9280 million respectively of shortterm investments we typically invest our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa 

capital expenditures related to continuing operations excluding those associated with property and equipment attributable to acquisitions were approximately 768 million 970 million and 662 million for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our capital expenditures are primarily related to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment 

during the fiscal year ended july 31 2007 we used approximately 1200 million in cash for the acquisition of universal which includes the following seven locations in the uk sandy sandtoft sandwich westbury chester denny and wootton during the fiscal year ended july 31 2006 we used cash for the acquisition of facilities in or near billings montana fruitland maryland altoona pennsylvania chambersburg pennsylvania york haven pennsylvania greenwood nebraska and grand island nebraska which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately 230 million during the fiscal year ended july 31 2005 we used cash for the acquisition of operations in lexington kentucky and columbia missouri which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately 45 million 

during the year ended july 31 2006 we invested approximately 90 million for a 50 equity interest in lanelogic a delaware limited liability corporation “lanelogic” we have no further contractual funding commitment based on our evaluation of lanelogic and the related agreements management believes that lanelogic does not constitute a variable interest entity as defined in fin no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities  as a result our investment has been accounted for under the equity method prescribed by apb no 18 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  

during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 our chairman and ceo made a personal unsecured loan to lanelogic to prevent a restriction of working capital from disrupting its business as lanelogic sought additional equity financing the loan was repaid during the second quarter ended january 31 2007 we have concluded that the personal unsecured loan did not cause a change in the accounting of lanelogic as an equity method investment during the second quarter ended january 31 2007 lanelogic received a strategic equity investment totaling approximately 10 million from two new investment groups as well as lanelogic’s founder we did not participate in this additional equity financing into lanelogic in addition lanelogic converted from a limited liability company to a delaware corporation of which we are now a stockholder 

on august 15 2007 subsequent to the end of our fiscal year our chairman and ceo provided a personal guaranty in favor of dealer services corporation as a condition for providing a credit facility to lanelogic inc a corporation in which we have a less than controlling interest the guaranty was approved by our audit committee we have concluded that the personal guaranty does not cause a change in the accounting of lanelogic as an equity method investment 

financing activities 

in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we generated approximately 109 million 54 million and 18 million respectively through the exercise of stock options 

in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we generated approximately 15 million 16 million and 14 million respectively through the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase program

repurchase program the repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time for the year ended july 31 2007 we repurchased 2995405 shares at a weighted average price of 2991 for the year ended july 31 2006 we repurchased 366000 shares at a weighted average price of 2424 no shares were repurchased in fiscal 2005 we accounted for the repurchase of our common stock in the years ended july 31 2007 and 2006 by reducing common stock by 896 million and 89 million respectively during the period from february 2003 through july 31 2007 we repurchased a total of 7033705 shares at a weighted average price of 1841

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to vehicle pooling costs allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill income taxes longlived assets and self insured liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2007 the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 0021 revenue 

arrangements with multiple deliverables “eitf 0021” which addresses accounting for multipleelement arrangements and staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” which addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of our current north american contracts collecting the proceeds from the buyer we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and accordingly we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection 

vehicle sales where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf are recognized in accordance with sab 104 on the sale date which is typically the point of high bid acceptance upon high bid acceptance a legal binding contract is formed with the buyer and we record the gross sales price as revenue 

in certain cases seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer however we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items as a result we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered which generally occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller 

we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of eitf 0021 to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multielement arrangement we have concluded that the sale and the postsale services are separate units of accounting the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale and the fees for the postsale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 

we also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our buyers and sellers 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor transportation and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis 

we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 151 inventory costs “sfas 151” to our vehicle pooling costs sfas 151 requires that items such as idle facility expense excessive spoilage double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as currentperiod charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of “so abnormal” as provided in accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 inventory pricing  in addition sfas 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our salvage sales operating segment annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 

income taxes and deferred tax assets 

we are required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 

we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis us generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets our ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on the company’s ability to generate future taxable income accordingly we have established a valuation allowance when in certain taxable jurisdictions the utilization of the tax asset is uncertain additional timing differences future earning trends andor tax strategies may occur which could warrant a need for establishing an additional valuation allowance or a reserve 

longlived asset valuation including intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by a comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the 

estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

stockbased compensation 

we account for our stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees using the fair value method as required by sfas no 123r sharebased payment  sfas no 123r requires that the compensation cost related to sharebased payment transactions measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued be recognized in the financial statements determining the fair value of options using the blackscholes model or other currently accepted option valuation models requires highly subjective assumptions including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the grant date if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense which could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to medical general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be impacted

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate and foreign currency risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities as of july 31 2007 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at a variable rate and aaa rated auction rate securities which also bear interest at a variable rate due to the average maturity and nature of the company’s investment portfolio we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments 

our exposure to foreign currency risks relates to our operations in canada and the uk we do not hedge our exposure to the canadian dollar or the british pound we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting as such item is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2007 the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we have excluded one acquisition universal salvage or universal which we made in june 2007 from the scope of management’s evaluation as the late timing of this acquisition made it impracticable to conduct a meaningful evaluation of the acquired business’ internal control over financial reporting before the end of the fiscal year universal constituted 1620 million and 1247 million of total and net assets respectively as of july 31 2007 and 148 million and 10 million of revenues and net income respectively for the year then ended notwithstanding the exclusion of universal from our assessment there was no material change to our internal control over financial reporting due to the acquisition pursuant to rule 15d15 of the exchange act our assessment on internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2008 will include universal management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment this assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our finance department 

based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2007 ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report which appears on the following page of this annual report on form 10k 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of copart inc 

we have audited copart inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria copart inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

as indicated in the accompanying “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of universal salvage which is included in the july 31 2007 consolidated financial statements of copart inc and constituted 1620 million and 1247 million of total and net assets respectively as of july 31 2007 and 148 million and 10 million of revenues and net income respectively 

for the year then ended our audit of internal control over financial reporting of copart inc also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of universal salvage 

in our opinion copart inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of july 31 2007 based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of copart inc as of july 31 2007 and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended july 31 2007 of copart inc and our report dated september 25 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart inc have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1   business 

general 

copart inc is a leading provider of salvage vehicle sales services in the united states 

we provide vehicle suppliers primarily insurance companies with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation “vb 2 ” internet auctionstyle sales technology we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs we generate revenues primarily from fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage

we have grown our salvage vehicle sales business through a combination of acquisitions and the development of new facilities and also by increasing our buyer base and implementing additional valueadded services for both buyers and suppliers for fiscal year 2005 our revenues were approximately 4571 million and our operating income was approximately 1569 million during the fiscal year ending july 31 2005 we acquired two salvage vehicle storage facilities and opened seven new salvage vehicle storage facilities we acquired storage sites located in lexington kentucky and columbia missouri we opened new vehicle storage sites in strongsville ohio ocala florida knoxville tennessee loganville georgia spokane washington tallahassee florida and hialeah florida 

during fiscal 2004 we converted all of our salvage vehicle storage facilities to an internet based auctionstyle model using vb 2  this second generation technology combines two bidding processes an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the three preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and vb 2 ’s bid4u feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internetonly virtual sale bid4u will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internetonly virtual sale this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access

we believe the implementation of vb 2 across our salvage operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles from us it has also improved the efficiency of our operations for fiscal 2005 sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for 46 of total vehicles sold 25 of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 21 were sold to buyers out of country based on registration

we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the salvage vehicle sales and auction industry and have established our leading market position as follows 

·   by providing coverage that facilitates supplier access to buyers around the world reducing towing and thirdparty storage expenses offering a local presence for vehicle inspection stations and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by speciallytrained teams

·   by providing a comprehensive range of customer services that include merchandising services efficient title processing timely pickup and delivery of vehicles and internet sales

·   by establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions

·   by increasing the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and convenience of internet bidding

·   by applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through internet bidding webbased order processing salvage value quotes electronic communication with buyers and sellers vehicle imaging and an electronic used vehicle parts locator service and

·   by providing the venue for insurance customers through our virtual insured exchange “vix” product to enter a vehicle into a live virtual sale to establish its true value thereby allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles

we have expanded our business beyond salvage vehicle sales services and have entered the market for public sales of used vehicles we sell vehicles directly to the public and automobile dealers on behalf of banks leasing or financing companies automobile dealers repossession companies and for our own account currently we own six public automobile sales facilities located in detroit michigan chesapeake virginia new castle delaware greencastle pennsylvania pittsburgh pennsylvania and richmond virginia we operate our public automobile sales business under motors auction group inc “mag” a wholly owned subsidiary to date revenues from our public sales business have not been significant relative to the revenues from our salvage business 

we were organized as a california corporation in 1982 and became a public company in 1994 our principal executive offices are located at 4665 business center drive fairfield california 94534 and our telephone number at that address is 707 6395000 we maintain a website httpwwwcopartcom  where we make available free of charge our securities and exchange commission filings including our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission we are providing the address to our website solely for the information of investors information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference herein and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only 

industry overview 

the salvage vehicle industry provides a venue for salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate total loss vehicles salvage vehicle sales companies generally auction or sell salvage vehicles on consignment either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion salvage sales companies may purchase vehicles from vehicle suppliers at a formulabased price based on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated preloss value “actual cash value” and sell the vehicles for their own account salvage vehicle sales companies typically operate from one or more salvage facilities where vehicles are processed viewed stored and sold however copart through the introduction of vb 2  eliminated local live auctions in our operations and we now sell all our salvage vehicles over the internet

although there are other suppliers of salvage vehicles such as financial institutions vehicle leasing companies automobile rental companies charities and automobile dealers the primary source of salvage vehicles is insurance companies 

automobile manufacturers are incorporating certain standard features that increase passenger safety including unibody construction passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts 

plastic components airbags xenon lights and computer systems we believe that one effect of these features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes which could result in an increasing supply of total loss salvage vehicles in the future 

the primary buyers of salvage vehicles are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of salvage vehicle buyers either dismantle a vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale 

following an accident involving an insured vehicle the damaged vehicle is generally towed to a towing company or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its actual cash value fair market value the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs and the vehicle’s salvage value as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the actual cash value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a salvage vehicle sales company settle with the insured vehicle owner and receive title to the vehicle 

the primary factors that vehicle suppliers consider when selecting a salvage vehicle sales company include 

·   the anticipated percentage return on salvage ie gross salvage proceeds minus vehicle handling and selling expenses divided by the actual cash value

·   the services provided by the salvage vehicle sales company and the degree to which such services reduce administrative costs and expenses

·   the price the salvage vehicle sales company charges for its services

·   national coverage and ability to respond on a national scale and

·   the ability to generate custom seller reports

upon receipt of the pick up order the assignment the salvage vehicle sales company arranges for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle supplier the salvage vehicle sales company will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle suppliers to obtain the subject vehicle’s release from a towing company or vehicle repair facility typically advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered upon sale of the salvage vehicle 

the vehicle then remains in storage until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency “dmv” total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold 

operating and growth strategy 

our growth strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers iv increasing revenue and profitability at our public automobile sales facilities and v expanding the application of vb 2  

into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to affect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by introducing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary 

as part of our overall expansion strategy our objective is to increase our revenues operating profits and market share in the vehicle sales industry to implement our growth strategy we intend to continue to do the following 

acquire and develop new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets 

our strategy is to offer integrated services to vehicle suppliers on a national or regional basis by acquiring or developing salvage facilities in new and existing markets we integrate our new acquisitions into our national network and capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from among other things the reduction of duplicative overhead and the implementation of our operating procedures 

the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august 1 2002 through july 31 2005 

   

   

pursue national and regional vehicle supply agreements 

our broad national presence enhances our ability to enter into local regional or national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers we actively seek to establish national and regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities by utilizing our existing 

insurance company supplier relationships we are able to build new supplier relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets 

expand our service offerings to suppliers and buyers 

over the past several years we have expanded our available service offerings to vehicle suppliers and buyers the primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize returns to our suppliers and maximize product value to our buyers recent service enhancements include for our suppliers realtime access to sales data over the internet and for our buyers the implementation of vb 2 realtime bidding at all of our facilities permitting buyers at any location worldwide to participate in the sales at all of our yards in north america we plan to continue to refine and expand our services including offering software that can assist our suppliers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that help suppliers integrate their systems with ours

increase revenue and profitability at our public sales facilities 

our public automobile sales facilities allow dealers to bid via the internet and both dealers and the general public to bid at live sales on a wide range of endoflease vehicles repossessed vehicles dealer tradeins and vehicles that we offer for sale on our own account to date we have acquired six facilities and launched our public automobile sales website 

expand the application of vb 2 into new markets

we believe that the value that vb 2 has demonstrated in the salvage vehicle sales market primarily by i increasing returns to sellers by expanding the pool of bidders to any person in the world with access to the internet and ii increasing buyer convenience by eliminating the need to travel to the physical location of the sale can be beneficial to other industries accordingly we will actively explore the possible application of vb 2 outside of the salvage vehicle sales industry

our competitive advantages 

we believe that the following attributes and the services that we offer position us to take advantage of many opportunities in the salvage vehicle sales industry 

national coverage and ability to respond on a national scale 

since our inception in 1982 we have expanded from a single facility in vallejo california to an integrated network of 117 facilities located in the united states and canada as of july 31 2005 we are able to offer integrated services on a national basis to our vehicle suppliers which allow us to respond to the needs of our suppliers and buyers with maximum efficiency our national coverage provides our suppliers with key advantages including 

·   a reduction in administrative time and effort

·   a reduction in overall vehicle towing costs

·   convenient local facilities

·   improved access to buyers throughout the world and

·   a prompt response in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophe

valueadded services 

we believe that we offer the most comprehensive range of services in our industry including

·   copartfinder our internetbased used vehicle parts locator that provides vehicle dismantlers with greater resale opportunities for their salvage purchases and

·   offsite sales which allow vehicle suppliers to sell any vehicle boat or heavy equipment without transporting it to one of our facilities

proven ability to acquire and integrate acquisitions 

we have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle storage facilities since becoming a public company in 1994 we have completed the acquisition of 60 salvage vehicle storage facilities as part of our acquisition and integration strategy we seek to 

·   strengthen our national network and access new markets

·   utilize our existing corporate and technology infrastructure over a larger base of operations and

·   introduce our comprehensive services and operational expertise

we strive to integrate all new facilities into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle suppliers we work with new suppliers to implement our fee structures and new service programs we typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain knowledge about and respond to the local market we also assign a special integration team to help convert newly acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary software systems enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and sales systems 

technology to enhance and expand our business 

we have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering our proprietary software programs provide vehicle suppliers with online access to data and reports regarding their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our facilities this technology allows vehicle suppliers to monitor each stage of our salvage vehicle sales process from pick up to sale and settlement by the buyer our full range of internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimizes the administrative and processing costs for us as well as our suppliers we believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients resulting in high client retention and allow us to expand our national supply contracts 

our service offerings 

we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services which expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process maximizing proceeds and minimizing costs 

online supplier access 

through copart access our internetbased service for vehicle suppliers we enable suppliers to assign vehicles for sale check sales calendars view vehicle images and history view and reprint body shop invoices and towing receipts and view the historical performance of the vehicles sold at our sales 

salvage estimation services 

we offer copart proquote a proprietary service that assists suppliers in the vehicle claims evaluation process by providing online salvage value estimates which helps suppliers determine whether to repair a particular vehicle or deem it a total loss 

virtual insured exchange “vix” 

we provide the venue for insurance customers to enter a vehicle into a live virtual auctionstyle sale to establish its true value thereby allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles 

transportation services 

we maintain contracts with thirdparty vehicle transport companies which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers’ vehicles within 24 hours our national network and transportation capabilities provides cost and time savings to our vehicle suppliers and ensures ontime vehicle pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters 

vehicle inspection stations 

we offer certain of our major insurance company suppliers office and yard space to house vehicle inspection stations onsite at our storage facilities we have over 30 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities nationwide an onsite vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company suppliers with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles which reduces storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility 

ondemand reporting 

we provide vehicle suppliers with ondemand reports online via fax or email that summarize data on salvage vehicles that we process for the particular supplier these reports track our vehicle suppliers’ gross and net returns on each vehicle service charges and other data that enable our vehicle suppliers to more easily administer and monitor the salvage vehicle disposition process 

dmv processing 

we have extensive expertise in dmv document and title processing for salvage vehicles we have developed a computer system which provides a direct link to the dmv computer systems of several states this allows us to expedite the processing of vehicle title paperwork 

flexible vehicle processing programs 

at the election of the vehicle supplier we sell vehicles pursuant to our percentage incentive program consignment basis or on a fixed fee consignment basis 

percentage fee consignment   our percentage incentive program “pip” is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle suppliers under pip we agree to sell all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle supplier in a specified market usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price because our revenues under pip are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return on salvage vehicles we provide the vehicle supplier at our expense with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility storage for up to 90 days and dmv document and title processing in addition we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather washing vehicle exteriors vacuuming vehicle interiors cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires making keys for driveable vehicles and identifying driveable vehicles we believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of salvage vehicles thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle suppliers and us in fiscal year 2005 2004 and 2003 we processed approximately 68 65 and 67 respectively of all our salvage vehicles under pip

fixed fee consignment   under our fixed fee consignment program we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee generally 50 to 175 per vehicle although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs in fiscal year 2005 2004 and 2003 we processed approximately 32 35 and 33 respectively of all our salvage vehicles under the fixed fee consignment program

buyer network 

we maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair resale and exporting businesses our database includes each buyer’s vehicle preference and purchasing history this data enables us to notify via email prospective buyers throughout the world of salvage vehicles available for bidding that match their vehicle preferences listings of salvage vehicles to be sold on a particular day and location are also made available on the internet 

sales process 

we offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles we utilize vb 2  an auctionstyle sales methodology that we developed this second generation technology combines two bidding processes an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the three preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and bid4u will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internetonly virtual sale bid4u will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internetonly virtual sale this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access

copartfinder 

copartfinder is our unique internet “search engine” that enables users to locate used vehicle parts quickly and efficiently copartfinder is accessible by the public through a copartsponsored website copartfinder lists vehicles recently sold at our sales and identifies certain purchasers this allows vehicle dismantlers and other resellers to streamline their parts sale process and access a large pool of potential buyers we charge a nominal fee to potential parts buyers who can use copartfinder to search for specific 

vehicle makes and models and view digital images of vehicles that meet their requirements once a specific parts supplier is identified for a specific part requirement buyers may have the option to call fax or email the dismantlersupplier we believe that copartfinder provides an incentive for vehicle dismantlers to purchase their salvage vehicles through our sales process 

supply arrangements and supplier marketing 

we obtain salvage vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle suppliers state farm insurance company accounted for 12 12 and 13 of our revenues for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively of the total number of vehicles that we processed in fiscal year 2005 2004 and 2003 we obtained approximately 79 85 and 85 respectively from insurance company suppliers our arrangements with our suppliers are either written or oral agreements that are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice 

we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle suppliers the agreements are customized to each vehicle supplier’s particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our contracts or arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle supplier in a designated geographic area 

we market our services to vehicle suppliers through an inhouse sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques including targeted mailing of our sales literature telemarketing followup personal sales calls and participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions based upon our historical data on salvage vehicles and vehicle information supplied by vehicle suppliers our marketing personnel will provide vehicle suppliers with detailed analysis of the net return on salvage vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on salvage vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses

we maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair resale and export businesses we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing buyers of salvage vehicles with a variety of programs and services to gain admission to one of our sales and become a registered buyer prospective buyers must first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee provide requested personal and business information and have in most states a vehicle dismantler’s dealer’s resale repair license or export license registration entitles a buyer to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements a buyer may also bring guests to a facility to preview vehicles for sale for a fee strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale we market to buyers on the internet and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing and participation in trade show events 

competition 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle suppliers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers include the adesa corporation auction broadcasting company insurance auto auctions inc manheim auctions and sadisco the largest national dismantlers include greenleaf and lkq corporation these national dismantlers in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the 

american recycling association and the united recyclers group may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing auction and sales companies entirely including us 

management information systems 

our primary management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business operating software that we developed and which tracks salvage and public sales vehicles throughout the sales process we call this proprietary business operating software the copart auction system “cas” and have implemented cas at all of our salvage storage facilities for the public sales business we call this proprietary business operating software motors auction exchange “max” in addition we have integrated our mainframe computer system with internet and intranet systems in order to provide secure access to cas and max data and images in a variety of formats 

our auctionstyle service product vb 2  is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required our sale internet and imaging services are load balanced across different geographical data centers

we have invested in a new production data center that is designed to run the business in the event of an emergency the facility’s electrical and mechanical systems are continually monitored this facility is located in an area considered to be free of weather related disasters and earthquakes 

employees 

as of july 31 2005 we had approximately 2421 fulltime employees of whom approximately 252 were engaged in general and administrative functions and approximately 2169 were engaged in yard and fleet operations we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle sales industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oils and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination certain of our facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in aboveground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be disposed of as nonhazardous or hazardous waste as appropriate we have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities and we have initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance 

in connection with the acquisition of our dallas texas facility in 1994 we set aside 30 million to cover the costs of environmental remediation stabilization and related consulting expenses for a sixacre portion of the facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former operators we began the stabilization process in 1996 and completed it in 1999 we paid all remediation and related costs from the 30 million fund and in accordance with the acquisition agreement distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller of the dallas facility less 2 million which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the nofurtheraction letter in september 2002 our environmental engineering consultant issued a report which concludes that the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized the leadimpacted soil and that the concrete cap should prevent impact to storm water and subsequent surface 

water impact our consultant thereafter submitted an operations and maintenance plan “plan” to the texas commission on environmental quality “tceq” providing for a twoyear inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap and a twoyear ground and surface water monitoring plan in january of 2003 the tceq approved the plan subject to the additions of upstream background surface water samples from the intermittent stream adjacent to the facility and documentation of any repairs to the concrete cap during the post closuremonitoring period the first semiannual water sampling was conducted in april 2003 which reflected that the leadimpacted stabilized soil is not impacting the ground andor surface water the second round of semiannual water samples collected in october and november 2003 reported concentration of lead in one storm water and one surface water sample in excess of the established upstream criteria for lead in correspondence which we received in july 2004 the tceq approved with comment our water monitoring report dated february 24 2004 the tceq instructed us to continue with postclosure monitoring and maintenance activities and submit the next report in accordance with the approved schedules in february 2005 a report from our environmental engineering consultant was transmitted to the tceq containing the results of annual monitoring activities consisting of two 2 semiannual sampling events which occurred in apriljune 2004 and octobernovember 2004 laboratory analytical results indicated no lead concentrations exceeding the target concentration level set in the corrective measures study for the site the company’s environmental engineering consultant concluded in the february 2005 report to the tecq that it is unlikely that lead concentrations detected in the stormwater runoff samples are attributable to the lead impacted soils based on the results of the 2004 samplings we requested that no further action be taken and that a closure letter be issued by the tceq we are not assured of receiving the nofurtheraction letter and we may incur further liabilities if the stabilization process proves ineffective in addition in 1994 we detected a small quantity of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater monitoring well at the dallas facility our environmental consultants concluded that both substances arose from an offsite source and no further action was recommended 

we do not believe that any of the above environmental matters will either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

governmental regulations 

our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by state and provincial motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

legal proceedings 

we are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage handling or disposal of vehicles and patent infringement we are also involved in various governmental and administrative proceedings primarily relating to licensing and operation of our business among this litigation is a lawsuit filed by ciano dessources on may 21 2003 in the commonwealth of massachusetts superior court department against copart of connecticut inc and copart inc which purports to be a class action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by us as abandoned vehicles which the named plaintiff contends were disposed of without complying with state laws relief sought included class certification declaratory remedial andor injunctive relief 

including the ordering of a compliance program that will essentially protect consumers as well as damages fees and costs copart’s motion for summary judgment was granted on december 8 2004 dismissing the class claim element of the lawsuit however this dismissal may be reconsidered and may also be appealed once the remaining individual claims of the named plaintiff are adjudicated 

on june 10 2005 manheim services corp filed suit against copart inc in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia atlanta division alleging infringement of manheim’s assigned us patent no 5774873 relief sought included a patent infringement judgment an injunction prohibiting copart from using any infringing product or service including vb 2  damages fees costs and expenses on august 3 2005 copart denied the claim and asserted counterclaims based on violations of antitrust laws and commonlaw tortious interference no trial date has yet been set

on september 16 2005 richard m gray filed suit against copart and a safrin in the state court for the county of chatham state of georgia alleging a class action for unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by copart and related claims relief sought included class certification damages fees costs and expenses 

we provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters we believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims if any cannot be determined with certainty 

factors that may affect future results 

we depend on a limited number of major suppliers of salvage vehicles the loss of one or more of these major suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates 

historically a limited number of vehicle suppliers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues in fiscal 2005 vehicles supplied by our two largest suppliers accounted for approximately 20 of our revenues supplier arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice vehicle suppliers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle suppliers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle supplier or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a substantial vehicle supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates 

our strategic shift from live salvage sales to an entirely internet based sales model presents new risks including substantial technology risks 

in fiscal 2004 we converted all our salvage sales from a live auction process to an entirely internet based auctionstyle model based on technology developed internally by us the conversion represents a significant change in the way we conduct business and presents numerous risks including our increased reliance on the availability and reliability of our network systems in particular we believe the conversion presents the following risks among others 

·   our operating results in a particular period could be adversely affected in the event our networks are not operable for an extended period of time for any reason as a result of internet viruses or as a result of any other technological circumstance that makes us unable to conduct our virtual sales

·   our business is increasingly reliant on internally developed technology and we have limited historic experience developing technologies or systems for largescale implementation and use

·   the change in our business model may make it more difficult for management investment analysts and investors to model or predict our future operating results until sufficient historic data is available to evaluate the effect of the vb 2 implementation over a longer period of time and in different economic environments

·   our increasing reliance on proprietary technology subjects us to intellectual property risks including the risk of third party infringement claims or the risk that we cannot establish or protect intellectual property rights in our technologies we have filed patent applications for vb 2 in the united states netherlands and europe but we cannot provide any assurances that patents will actually issue or that if issued the patent could not later be found to be unenforceable or invalid in june 2005 manheim services corp filed suit against us in federal district court in georgia alleging among other things that vb 2 infringes a patent assigned to manheim we intend to defend the lawsuit vigoriously but an adverse ruling settlement or judgment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation

our results of operations may not continue to benefit from the implementation of vb 2 to the extent we have experienced in recent periods

we believe that the implementation of our proprietary vb 2 sales technologies across our salvage operations has had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base and increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales vb 2  

was implemented across all our salvage yards beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 we do not believe however that we will continue to experience improvements in our results of operations at the same relative rates we have experienced in the last year 

in addition we implemented vb 2 in our public sales facilities we cannot predict if or to what extent vb 2 will have a favorable impact on these operations differences between our salvage and public operations in particular the relative importance of inspecting the vehicle being sold may result in our experiencing a negative or less favorable impact on our public sales than we have experienced in our salvage sales

failure to have sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our salvage yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage vehicles 

capacity at our salvage yards varies from period to period and from region to region for example following adverse weather conditions in a particular area our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent salvage yards in markets where we have limited excess capacity and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage vehicles which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

factors such as mild weather conditions in the united states can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates 

mild weather conditions in the united states tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates and could have an adverse effect on our operating results conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle suppliers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections 

high fuel prices in the united states and canada may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our earnings growth rates 

significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates a material reduction in accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth in addition under our pip contracts the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee we may incur increased fees which we will not be able to pass on to the insurance companies a material increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results 

the salvage vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 

we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other vehicle sales and auction companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other suppliers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage sales process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive sales and 

auction companies and large dismantlers many of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle suppliers the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our suppliers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense 

we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of salvage vehicle sales facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle suppliers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share results of operations and financial condition additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new salvage vehicle sales facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and development of new facilities 

we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle sales facilities and the development of new salvage vehicle storage facilities there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

·   continue to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms

·   expand existing facilities in no growth regulatory environments

·   increase revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities

·   maintain the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions or

·   create new salvage vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and profitability requirements

as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to manage growth is not only dependent on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to 

·   hire train and manage additional qualified personnel

·   establish new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle suppliers

·   identify and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms

·   secure adequate capital

·   maintain the supply of vehicles from vehicle suppliers and

·   compete successfully in the public automobile sales sector

our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline 

our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following 

·   fluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles

·   the availability of salvage vehicles

·   variations in vehicle accident rates

·   buyer participation in the internet bidding process

·   delays or changes in state title processing

·   changes in state or federal laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles

·   changes in state laws affecting who may purchase salvage vehicles

·   our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully

·   the timing and size of our new facility openings

·   the announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors

·   severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns

·   the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations and infrastructure

·   the availability and cost of general business insurance

·   labor costs and collective bargaining

·   availability of subhaulers at competitive rates

·   acceptance of buyers and sellers of our internetbased model deploying vb 2  a proprietary internet auctionstyle sales technology

·   current levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles may not continue

·   the introduction of a similar internet product by a competitor and

·   the ability to obtain necessary permits to operate salvage storage facilities

due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our strategic shift to an internet based sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

implementation of vb 2 across our salvage operations and more recently in our public sales has increased the relative importance of intellectual property rights to our business our intellectual property rights include pending patent applications for vb 2   as well as trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights we are in the process of prosecuting an initial patent application relating to vb 2   and cannot predict whether a patent will actually issue from that application even if a patent is issued the scope of the protection gained may be insufficient or any issued patent could subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable in addition we are increasingly entering agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed deployed or made available we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by third parties or intentionally or accidentally by our employees which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims which are costly to defend could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our vb 2   auctionstyle sales technologies across our business and abandoned live auctions as we face increasing competition the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows in june 2005 a competitor filed a patent infringement claim against us relating to our vb 2   technologies this litigation and any other intellectual property claims whether with or without merit can be timeconsuming expensive to litigate and settle and can divert management resources and attention from our core business an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses if it is available for us to license at all we could also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense

new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require the company to make adjustments in our accounting policies that could adversely affect our financial statements 

the financial accounting standards board the public company accounting oversight board the securities and exchange commission or other accounting organizations or governmental entities issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that sometimes require us to change our accounting policies and procedures to date we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but future pronouncements or interpretations could require us to change our policies or procedures moreover we continually review our critical accounting policies in light of the accounting literature and changes in our operations 

government regulation of the salvage vehicle sales and auction industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability 

participants in the salvage vehicle sales and auction industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of us or canadian federal state provincial and local governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle sales industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination environmental issues resulting from fuel spills oil spillage or similar problems are also present at our public sales facilities in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience problems with our providers of fleet operations our business could be harmed 

we rely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost these costs may not be passed on to our sellers or buyers 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted further we rely on independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures if these actuaries provide guidance based on erroneous assumptions use models 

mathematically flawed or otherwise provide advice that is inaccurate or unrepresentative then it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other shareholders 

our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 23 of our common stock as of july 31 2005 if they were to act together these shareholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders including the election of directors any amendments to our articles of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these shareholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these shareholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have a shareholder rights plan or poison pill which could affect the price of our common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest or to acquire us 

in march 2003 our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan commonly known as a poison pill the poison pill may discourage delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities initiating a tender offer or proxy contest or acquiring us through an acquisition merger or similar transaction such an acquirer could be prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices 

if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 

our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chief executive officer and a jayson adair our president or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and time consuming 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley requires among other things that companies adopt new corporate governance measures imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for board and audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies their chief executive officers and chief financial officers for securities law violations in addition the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is traded has adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations will increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations these new rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee 

item 2    properties 

our corporate headquarters are located in fairfield california this facility consists of approximately 100000 square feet of office space owned by copart we also own or lease an additional 117 operating facilities in the united states and canada located in california texas arkansas oklahoma kansas washington oregon georgia missouri new york connecticut florida pennsylvania new jersey massachusetts maryland ohio illinois minnesota wisconsin mississippi north carolina indiana arizona louisiana utah nevada alabama south carolina iowa michigan tennessee virginia colorado idaho new mexico kentucky delaware maine west virginia montana alaska and ontario we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations and additional offices after the fiscal year ended july 31 2005 we opened facilities in hawaii and nebraska increasing the number of states we operate in to 44

overview 

we provide vehicle suppliers primarily insurance companies with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation “vb 2 ” internet auctionstyle sales technology we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs we generate revenues primarily from fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage

we process salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method on either the percentage incentive program “pip” or on a fixed fee consignment basis using either consignment method only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue 

for the fiscal years ended july 31 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 68 65 and 67 of the vehicles we sold respectively were processed under pip we attempt to convert vehicle supplier agreements at acquired operations to pip which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment programs those vehicles not sold under the pip program were processed under fixed fee agreements 

due to a number of factors including the timing and size of new acquisitions market conditions and acceptance of pip by vehicle suppliers the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs in future periods may vary 

our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include sales fees under pip agreements and fixed fee programs where we charge for title processing special preparation storage and selling salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under fixed fee contracts transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 

purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our sales for vehicles processed that we own 

costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel fleet maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management accounting data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees research and development and marketing expenses 

during fiscal 2004 we converted all of our salvage vehicle storage and sales facilities to an internet based auctionstyle model using our vb 2 internet sales technology this second generation technology combines two bidding processes an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the three preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and bid4u will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internetonly virtual sale bid4u will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internetonly virtual sale this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access

we believe the implementation of vb 2 across our salvage operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for salvage from us it has also improved the efficiency of our operations for fiscal 2005 sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for 46 of total vehicles sold 25 of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 21 were sold to buyers out of country

the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions new openings weather and product introductions during such periods 

acquisitions and new operations 

we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired twelve vehicle storage facilities and established eleven new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2003 all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities as part of this strategy in fiscal 2005 we acquired new facilities in or near lexington kentucky and columbia missouri and opened new facilities in strongsville ohio ocala florida knoxville tennessee loganville georgia spokane washington tallahassee florida and hialeah florida in fiscal 2004 we acquired new facilities in or near eugene oregon cleveland ohio and anchorage alaska and opened new facilities in or near toronto canada and helena montana in fiscal 2003 we acquired new facilities in or near pittsburgh pennsylvania reno nevada and richmond virginia and opened new facilities in or near springfield missouri corpus christi texas ft pierce florida rancho cucamonga california richmond virginia and albany new york we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have 117 facilities located in north america and are able to provide national coverage for our suppliers 

we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers iv increasing revenue and profitability at our public automobile sales facilities and v expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to vehicle pooling costs allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill income taxes longlived assets and self insured liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2005 the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery loading title processing preparation and storage we evaluate multipleelement arrangements relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 0021 which addresses accounting for multipleelement arrangements and staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab104 which addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting 

the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the sellers behalf and under most of our current contracts collecting the proceeds from the buyer we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and accordingly we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection 

in certain cases seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer however we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items as a result we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered which occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller 

we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle charging a separate fee for each service each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of eitf 0021 to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multielement arrangement we have concluded that the auction service and the postauction services are separate units of accounting the fees for the auction service are recognized upon completion of the auction and the fees for the postauction services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 

we also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and relist and latepayment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer no provision for returns has been established as all sales are final with no right of return although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of nonperformance by our sellers 

vehicle pooling costs 

we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard and fleet expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard and fleet expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor transportation and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard and fleet expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

we evaluate separately the impairment of goodwill of our salvage and our public sales operating segments annually by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value in prior years we evaluated impairment of goodwill at the facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value during fiscal 2004 when we centralized the sales process with the implementation of vb 2  we determined the appropriate level for testing for impairment was at the salvage and public sales levels under this accounting policy we have not recognized any charges for the impairment of goodwill in previous years or the current year future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of an operating segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring further impairment charges in the future

deferred tax assets 

we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets our ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income accordingly we have established a valuation allowance when in certain taxable jurisdictions the utilization of the tax asset is uncertain additional timing differences and future tax losses may occur which could warrant a need for establishing additional valuation allowances or reserves against certain deferred tax assets 

we are also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 

longlived asset valuation 

we evaluate longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 

retained insurance liabilities 

we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenues there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 

 

  

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

revenues were approximately 4571 million during fiscal 2005 an increase of approximately 563 million or 14 over fiscal 2004 the increase was due primarily to increased vehicle sales volume on which fees are generated and higher fees resulting from increased sales proceeds per vehicle the increase in gross proceeds per vehicle the gross sales price of the vehicle yields higher revenue per car as buyer fees and certain fees including those sold under the pip program are based on the gross proceeds per vehicle and generally increase as gross proceeds per vehicle grow we believe the increase in proceeds per vehicle was the result of the introduction of virtual bidding second generation “vb 2 ” as more buyers are able to participate in the sales existing facilities contributed approximately 517 million of the revenue growth and new facilities in or near strongsville ohio ocala florida knoxville tennessee lexington kentucky loganville georgia spokane washington tallahassee florida hialeah florida and columbia missouri contributed approximately 46 million of new revenue

historically we recorded revenue for most seller and buyer fees upon completion of a sale during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we recorded an immaterial correction of an error to account for our services in accordance with the policy above the effect of which was to reduce revenue net income and diluted earnings per share by 44 million 15 million and 001 respectively for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended july 31 2005 

yard and fleet expenses were approximately 2533 million during fiscal 2005 an increase of approximately 175 million or 7 over fiscal 2004 the increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities approximately 44 million of the increase was the result of the acquisition and opening of new facilities yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities grew by approximately 131 million or 6 yard and fleet expenses decreased to 55 of revenues during fiscal 2005 as compared to 59 of revenues during fiscal 2004 due in part to the fixed cost nature of our business yard and fleet expenses in fiscal 2004 included a net adjustment to insurance reserves and sales taxes that decreased this expense by 36 million 

general and administrative expenses were approximately 470 million during fiscal 2005 an increase of approximately 68 million or 17 over fiscal 2004 the increase was primarily due to increases in software development cost technology hardware leasing cost and it payroll costs all directly associated with the development and deployment of vb 2  in addition the company saw increases in the cost of professional services impacted by sarbanesoxley compliance and increased payroll and benefit costs associated with expanded support headcount general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2005 and 2004

total other income was approximately 82 million during fiscal 2005 an increase of approximately 27 million or 48 from fiscal 2004 the increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income of approximately 34 million due to higher interest rates and a higher cash balance gain on the sale of fleet equipment decreased approximately 14 million as we sold the majority of the fleet in fiscal 2004 in connection with our decision to subcontract towing services other income which consists primarily of rental income increased approximately 07 million as we continued the rental of primarily unutilized areas within our facilities 

our effective combined federal state and local income tax rate for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was approximately 38 and 39 respectively  the decrease in rate is attributable to an overall lower state tax rate as we made certain revisions to our transfer pricing methodology and the beneficial impact of the growth in interest income which is predominantly federal tax exempt we do not expect significant changes to our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006

due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 1021 million for fiscal 2005 compared to net income of approximately 792 million for fiscal 2004 

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

revenues were approximately 4008 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 534 million or 15 over fiscal 2003 the increase was due primarily to increased salvage vehicle volume new service revenue and higher fees resulting from increased sales proceeds per vehicle we believe the increase in proceeds per vehicle was the result of the introduction of virtual bidding second generation “vb 2 ” as more buyers are able to participate in the sales existing facilities contributed approximately 520 million of new revenue and new facilities in or near toronto canada eugene oregon helena montana cleveland ohio and anchorage alaska contributed approximately 14 million of new revenue

yard and fleet expenses were approximately 2358 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 114 million or 5 over fiscal 2003 included in yard and fleet expense is a net adjustment to insurance reserves that decreased this expense by 36 million the increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities approximately 21 million of the increase was the result of the acquisition and opening of new facilities depreciation and amortization expense associated with yard activities increased approximately 50 million over fiscal 2003 this increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new storage and sales facilities yard and fleet expenses decreased to 59 of revenues during fiscal 2004 as compared to 65 of revenues during fiscal 2003 yard and fleet expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue and was due in part to the fixed cost nature of our business 

general and administrative expenses were approximately 402 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 80 million or 25 over fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to increases in software development cost technology hardware leasing cost and it payroll costs all directly associated with the development and deployment of vb 2  in addition the company saw increases in the cost of professional services impacted by sarbanesoxley compliance and increased payroll and benefit costs associated with expanded support headcount general and administrative expenses increased to 10 of revenues during fiscal 2004 as compared to 9 of revenues during fiscal 2003

total other income was approximately 55 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 21 million or 62 from fiscal 2003 gain on sale of fleet equipment represents the gain on the sale of 602 vehicles the sale of the equipment is associated with our decision to replace company owned trucks with subhaulers for towing services interest income decreased approximately 01 million due to lower interest rates during the first nine months of the fiscal year other income which consists primarily of rental income increased approximately 11 million as we rented several underutilized facilities 

our effective combined federal state and local income tax rate for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was approximately 39 

due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 792 million for fiscal 2004 compared to net income of approximately 572 million for fiscal 2003 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 2468 million and 616 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively mainly as a result of the conversion of 1726 million in shortterm investments in fiscal 2005 and changes in operating activities our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially affected by inflation during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this seasonal volume growth requires increased cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 

as of july 31 2005 we had working capital of approximately 2960 million including cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2525 million we invest substantially all of our cash balances in aaa rated auction rate securities auction rate securities are principally variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of 90 days auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction at predetermined shortterm intervals usually every 7 28 or 35 days they trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction although these instruments are issued and rated as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm securities because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset these auction rate securities were converted to cash prior to the end of the current fiscal year and were held in money market accounts our primary source of cash is from the collection of sellers’ fees and buyers’ fees from the sale of salvage vehicles

we believe that our currently available cash cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 209 million from fiscal 2004 to 1360 million in fiscal 2005 due to the profitability of the company offset by routine changes in working capital 

investing activities 

during the fiscal year ended july 31 2005 we purchased approximately 7554 million in shortterm investments these purchases were offset by the sale of 9280 million of shortterm investments we typically invest our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa which were converted to cash prior to the end of the fiscal year 

capital expenditures excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were approximately 663 million 646 million and 707 million for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our capital expenditures have related primarily to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment in addition in fiscal 2004 the company sold most of its transportation fleet as it moved to outsource this function sale of fleet equipment generated approximately 190 million in gross proceeds 

during the fiscal year ended july 31 2005 we used cash for the acquisition of operations in lexington kentucky and columbia missouri which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately 45 million during the fiscal year ended july 31 2004 we used cash for the acquisition of operations in eugene oregon cleveland ohio and anchorage alaska which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately 47 million during the fiscal year ended july 31 2003 we used cash for the acquisition of operations in west mifflin pennsylvania reno nevada and richmond virginia which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately 66 million 

financing activities 

in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 we generated approximately 18 million 51 million and 04 million respectively through the exercise of stock options 

in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 we generated approximately 14 million 13 million and 19 million respectively through the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase program 

in february 2003 the company’s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 9 million shares of its common stock the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited 

transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions no time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program the repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time for the year ended july 31 2005 we did not repurchase any shares as of july 31 2005 we repurchased a total of 3672300 shares at a weighted average price of 849 for the year ended july 31 2004 we repurchased a total of 977100 shares at a weighted average price of 1097 per share we accounted for the repurchase of our common stock by charging common stock for 312 million through october 14 2005 we have not repurchased any shares 

lease purchase and other contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july 31 2005 in thousands 

 

  

 

1   contractual obligations consist of future minimum lease payments under operating leases including offbalance sheet leases used in the normal course of business

2   commercial commitments include primarily letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions

credit facilities 

on february 23 2001 we entered into a credit facility with our existing banking syndicate the facility provided by wells fargo bank fleet national bank and us bank national association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of 106 million that matures in 2006 as of july 31 2005 we had available 01 million under this facility after taking into account 105 million of outstanding letters of credit we are subject to customary covenants including the following financial covenants 1 ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda 2 profitable operation 3 leverage ratio and 4 interest coverage ratio we are in compliance with all covenants at july 31 2005 

recently issued accounting standards 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “ inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 ” this statement amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “ inventory pricing ” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage sfas no 151 requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” in addition this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of sfas 151 shall be applied prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 with earlier application permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued the adoption of sfas no 151 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which replaces sfas 123 the accounting required by sfas 123r is similar to that of sfas 123 however the choice between recognizing the fair value of stock options in the income statement or disclosing the pro forma income statement effect of the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements allowed under sfas 123 has been eliminated in sfas 123r sfas 123r is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 and early adoption is permitted management intends to use the modified prospective transition method to adopt sfas 123r beginning in fiscal 2006 and expects that the implementation of sfas 123r will increase our stockbased compensation expense in fiscal 2006 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections—a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” this statement replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and fasb statement no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 management currently believes that adoption of the provisions of sfas no 154 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate and foreign currency risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities as of july 31 2005 our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts which bear interest at a variable rate during the course of the year we invested substantially all of our cash balances in aaa rated auction rate securities which also bear interest at a variable rate due to the average maturity and nature of the company’s investment portfolio we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are variable a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments

our exposure to foreign currency risks relates to our operations in canada which have not been significant we do not hedge our exposure to the canadian dollar we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting as such item is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within copart inc have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business tableend 

general   copart inc is a leading provider of salvage vehicle auction services in the united states   we provide vehicle suppliers primarily insurance companies with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimize administrative and processing costs we generate revenues primarily from auction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage   we have grown our salvage business through a combination of acquisitions and the development of new facilities and also by increasing our buyer base and implementing additional valueadded services for both buyers and suppliers for fiscal year 2004 our revenues were approximately 4008 million and our operating income was approximately 1248 million during the fiscal year ending july 31 2004 we acquired three salvage vehicle auction facilities and opened two new salvage vehicle auction facilities we acquired auction sites located in eugene oregon cleveland ohio and anchorage alaska we opened new vehicle auction sites in toronto canada and helena montana   during fiscal 2004 we converted all of our salvage vehicle auction facilities to an internet based auctionstyle model using our virtual bidding second generation “vb 2 ” internet sales technology this second generation technology combines two bidding processes an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the auction facility during the three preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and bid4u will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internetonly virtual sale bid4u will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internetonly virtual sale this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access   we believe the implementation of vb 2 across our salvage operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for salvage from us it has also improved the efficiency of our operations for fiscal 2004 sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for 41 of total vehicles sold 24 of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 17 were sold to buyers out of country 3   we believe that we offer the highest level of service in the salvage vehicle auction industry and have established our leading market position as follows    we have expanded our business beyond salvage vehicle auction services and have entered the market for public auctioning of used vehicles we auction vehicles directly to the public and automobile dealers on behalf of banks leasing or financing companies automobile dealers repossession companies and for our own account to date we own six public automobile auction facilities located in detroit michigan chesapeake virginia new castle delaware greencastle pennsylvania pittsburgh pennsylvania and richmond virginia we operate our public automobile auction business under motors auction group inc “mag” a wholly owned subsidiary to date revenues from our public auction business have not been significant relative to the revenues from our salvage business   we were organized as a california corporation in 1982 and became a public company in 1994 our principal executive offices are located at 4665 business center drive fairfield california 94534 and our telephone number at that address is 707 6395000 we maintain a website httpwwwcopartcom  where we make available free of charge our securities and exchange commission filings including our annual reports on form

industry overview   the salvage vehicle auction industry provides an outlet for salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate total loss vehicles salvage vehicle auction companies generally auction salvage vehicles on consignment either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price on occasion salvage auction companies may purchase vehicles from vehicle suppliers at a formulabased price based on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated preloss value “actual cash value” and auction the vehicles for their own account salvage vehicle auction companies typically operate from one or more salvage facilities where vehicles are processed stored and sold 4   although there are other suppliers of salvage vehicles such as financial institutions vehicle leasing companies automobile rental companies charities and automobile dealers the primary source of salvage vehicles is insurance companies   automobile manufacturers are incorporating certain standard features that increase passenger safety including unibody construction passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts plastic components airbags xenon lights and computer systems we believe that one effect of these features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes resulting in an increasing supply of total loss salvage vehicles in the future   the primary buyers of salvage vehicles are vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters vehicle dismantlers which we believe are the largest group of salvage vehicle buyers either dismantle a vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders used vehicle dealers or the public vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale   following an accident involving an insured vehicle the damaged vehicle is generally towed to a towing company or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination the vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage options and condition in order to estimate its actual cash value the adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs and the vehicle’s salvage value as well as customer service considerations if the cost of repair is greater than the actual cash value less the estimated salvage value the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss the insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a salvage vehicle auction company settle with the insured vehicle owner and receive title to the vehicle   the primary factors that vehicle suppliers consider when selecting a salvage vehicle auction company include    upon receipt of the pick up order the salvage vehicle auction company arranges for the transport of a vehicle to a facility as a service to the vehicle supplier the salvage vehicle auction company will customarily pay advance charges reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle suppliers to obtain the subject vehicle’s release from a towing company or vehicle repair facility typically advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered upon sale of the salvage vehicle   the vehicle then remains in storage until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency “dmv” total loss 5 vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the dmv upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the dmv which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pickup the vehicle is sold 

operating and growth strategy   our growth strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers iv increasing revenue and profitability at our public automobile auction facilities and v expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to affect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary   as part of our overall expansion strategy our objective is to increase our revenues operating profits and market share in the vehicle auction industry to implement our growth strategy we intend to continue to do the following 

 

   our strategy is to offer integrated services to vehicle suppliers on a national or regional basis by acquiring or developing salvage facilities in new and existing markets we integrate our new acquisitions into our national network and capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from among other things the reduction of duplicative overhead and the implementation of our operating procedures   the following chart sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened since the beginning of fiscal year 2002 through july 31 2004  6  

 

   our broad national presence enhances our ability to enter into local regional or national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers we actively seek to establish national and regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities by utilizing our existing insurance company supplier relationships we are able to build new supplier relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets 

 

   over the past several years we have expanded our available service offerings to vehicle suppliers and buyers the primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize returns to our suppliers and maximize product value to our buyers recent service enhancements include for our suppliers realtime access to sales data over the internet and for our buyers the implementation of vb 2 realtime bidding at all of our facilities permitting buyers at any location world wide to participate in the auction at all of our yards in north america we plan to continue to refine and expand our services including offering software that can assist our suppliers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that help suppliers integrate their systems with ours 

 

   our public automobile auctions allow dealers to bid via the internet and both dealers and the general public to bid at live auctions on a wide range of endoflease vehicles repossessed vehicles dealer tradeins and vehicles that we offer for sale on our own account to date we have acquired six facilities and launched our public automobile auction website we believe that through the introduction of vb 2 and increased vehicle volumes we will increase revenue and profitability at our public auction facilities 

 

   we believe that the value that vb 2 has demonstrated in the salvage vehicle auction market primarily by i increasing returns to sellers by expanding the pool of bidders to any person in the world with access to the internet and ii increasing buyer convenience by eliminating the need to travel to the physical location of the auction can be beneficial to other industries accordingly we will actively explore the possible application of vb 2 outside of the salvage vehicle auction industry 

our competitive advantages   we believe that the following attributes and the services that we offer position us to take advantage of many opportunities in the salvage vehicle auction industry 7 

 

   since our inception in 1982 we have expanded from a single facility in vallejo california to an integrated network of 107 facilities located in the united states and canada as of july 31 2004 we are able to offer integrated services on a national basis to our vehicle suppliers which allow us to respond to the needs of our suppliers and buyers with maximum efficiency our national coverage provides our suppliers with key advantages including  

 

   we believe that we offer the most comprehensive range of services in our industry including  

 

   we have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle auction facilities since becoming a public company in 1994 we have completed the acquisition of 58 salvage vehicle auction facilities as part of our acquisition and integration strategy we seek to    we strive to integrate all new facilities into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle suppliers we work with new suppliers to implement our fee structures and new service programs we typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to gain knowledge about and respond to the local market we also assign a special integration team to help convert newly acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary 8 software systems enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and auction systems 

 

   we have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering our proprietary software programs provide vehicle suppliers with online access to data and reports regarding their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our facilities this technology allows vehicle suppliers to monitor each stage of our salvage vehicle auction process from pick up to sale and settlement by the buyer our full range of internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimizes the administrative and processing costs for us as well as our suppliers we believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients resulting in high client retention and allow us to expand our national supply contracts 

our service offerings   we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services which expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process maximizing proceeds and minimizing costs 

 

   through copart access our internetbased service for vehicle suppliers we enable suppliers to assign vehicles for sale check sales calendars view vehicle images and history view and reprint body shop invoices and towing receipts and view the historical performance of the vehicles sold at our auctions 

 

   we offer copart proquote a proprietary service that assists suppliers in the vehicle claims evaluation process by providing online salvage value estimates which helps suppliers determine whether to repair a particular vehicle or deem it a total loss transportation services   we maintain contracts with thirdparty vehicle transport companies which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers’ vehicles within 24 hours our national network and transportation capabilities provide cost and time savings to our vehicle suppliers and ensures ontime vehicle pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters vehicle inspection stations   we offer certain of our major insurance company suppliers office and yard space to house vehicle inspection stations onsite at our auction facilities we have over 30 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities nationwide an onsite vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company suppliers with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles which reduces storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility 9 ondemand reporting   we provide vehicle suppliers with ondemand reports online via fax or email that summarize data on salvage vehicles that we process for the particular supplier these reports track our vehicle suppliers’ gross and net returns on each vehicle service charges and other data that enable our vehicle suppliers to more easily administer and monitor the salvage vehicle disposition process dmv processing   we have extensive expertise in dmv document and title processing for salvage vehicles we have developed a computer system which provides a direct link to the dmv computer systems of several states this allows us to expedite the processing of vehicle title paperwork flexible vehicle processing programs   at the election of the vehicle supplier we auction vehicles pursuant to our percentage incentive program consignment basis or on a fixed fee consignment basis   percentage fee consignment our percentage incentive program “pip” is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle suppliers under pip we agree to sell at auction all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle supplier in a specified market for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price because our revenues under pip are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return on salvage vehicles we provide the vehicle supplier at our expense with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility storage for up to 90 days and dmv document and title processing in addition we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather washing vehicle exteriors vacuuming vehicle interiors cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires making keys for driveable vehicles and identifying driveable vehicles we believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of salvage vehicles thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle suppliers and us in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 we processed approximately 65 67 and 67 respectively of all our salvage vehicles under pip   fixed fee consignment under our fixed fee consignment program we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee generally 50 to 175 per vehicle although sometimes included in the consignment fee we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility storage of the vehicle and other incidental costs in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 we processed approximately 35 33 and 33 respectively of all our salvage vehicles under the fixed fee consignment program buyer network   we maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair resale and exporting businesses our database includes each buyer’s vehicle preference and purchasing history this data enables us to notify via email prospective buyers throughout the world of salvage vehicles available for bidding that match their vehicle preferences listings of salvage vehicles to be auctioned on a particular day and location are also made available on the internet 10 auction process   we offer a flexible and unique auction process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles that we auction we utilize vb 2  a new auction methodology that we developed this second generation technology combines two bidding processes an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the auction facility during the three preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and bid4u will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internetonly virtual sale bid4u will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internetonly virtual sale this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access copartfinder   copartfinder is our unique internet “search engine” that enables users to locate used vehicle parts quickly and efficiently copartfinder is accessible by the public through a copartsponsored website copartfinder lists vehicles recently sold at our auctions and identifies certain purchasers this allows vehicle dismantlers and other resellers to streamline their parts sale process and access a large pool of potential buyers we charge a nominal fee to potential parts buyers who can use copartfinder to search for specific vehicle makes and models and view digital images of vehicles that meet their requirements once a specific parts supplier is identified for a specific part requirement buyers may have the option to call fax or email the dismantlersupplier we believe that copartfinder provides an incentive for vehicle dismantlers to purchase their salvage vehicles through our sales process 

supply arrangements and supplier marketing   we obtain salvage vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle suppliers state farm insurance company accounted for 12 13 and 14 of our revenues for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively of the total number of vehicles that we processed in fiscal year 2004 2003 and 2002 we obtained approximately 85 85 and 88 respectively from insurance company suppliers our arrangements with our suppliers are either written or oral agreements that are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice   we typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle suppliers the agreements are customized to each vehicle supplier’s particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods our contracts or arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle supplier in a designated geographic area   we market our services to vehicle suppliers through an inhouse sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques including targeted mailing of our sales literature telemarketing followup personal sales calls and participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions based upon our historical data on salvage vehicles and vehicle information supplied by vehicle suppliers our marketing personnel will provide vehicle suppliers with detailed analysis of the net return on salvage vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on salvage vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses 11 

buyers   we maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling rebuilding repair resale and export businesses we believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing buyers of salvage vehicles with a variety of programs and services to gain admission to one of our sales and become a registered buyer prospective buyers must first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee provide requested personal and business information and have in most states a vehicle dismantler’s dealer’s resale repair license or export license registration entitles a buyer to transact business at any of our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements a buyer may also bring guests to a facility to preview vehicles for sale for a fee strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale we market to buyers on the internet and via email notifications sales notices telemarketing and participation in trade show events 

competition   we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction companies and vehicle dismantlers these national regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle suppliers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours the largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers include the adesa corporation auction broadcasting company insurance auto auctions inc manheim auctions and sadisco the largest national dismantlers include greenleaf and lkq corporation these national dismantlers in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the american recycling association and the united recyclers group purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies thereby bypassing auction companies entirely including us 

management information systems   our primary management information system consists of an ibm as400 mainframe computer system integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business operating software that we developed and which tracks salvage and public auction vehicles throughout the auction process we call this proprietary business operating software the copart auction system “cas” and have implemented cas at all of our salvage auction facilities for the public auction business we call this proprietary business operating software motors auction exchange “max” in addition we have integrated our mainframe computer system with internet and intranet systems in order to provide secure access to cas and max data and images in a variety of formats   our auctionstyle service product vb 2  is served by an array of identical highdensity highperformance sun fire servers each individual sale is configured to run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array as required   we have a complete backup data center that is designed to run the business in the event of an emergency this backup data center is designed to be quickly deployed when needed we also host our own intranet and internet platforms 

employees   as of july 31 2004 we had approximately 2235 fulltime employees of whom approximately 262 where engaged in general and administrative functions and approximately 1973 were engaged in yard and fleet operations 12   we are not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements however during the fiscal year drivers clerical employees and yard employees at our woodhaven michigan facility were represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters as a result of three nlrb elections in january and july of 2003   in october 2003 we made a strategic decision to exit the trucking business and to retain independent subhaulers instead in late 2003 we terminated the employment of all our truck drivers other than truck drivers employed in woodhaven michigan and commenced the sale of our truck fleet since our woodhaven michigan facility drivers were represented by the teamsters we were required to bargain over the effects of that decision on the woodhaven drivers even though no collective bargaining contract was in effect in july 2004 we negotiated an agreement with the teamsters whereby we terminated the employment of our woodhaven facility drivers and the teamsters signed a settlement agreement waiving any claims concerning their termination   in september 2004 we negotiated an agreement with the teamsters whereby the teamsters agreed to file a disclaimer of interest with the nlrb concerning the woodhaven michigan clerical and yard employees these units are therefore no longer represented by a union and we have no further obligation to bargain with the teamsters for any of our woodhaven michigan employees 

environmental matters   our operations are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle auction industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at auction facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oils and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination certain of our facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in aboveground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be disposed of as nonhazardous or hazardous waste as appropriate we have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities and we have initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance   in connection with the acquisition of our dallas texas facility in 1994 we set aside 30 million to cover the costs of environmental remediation stabilization and related consulting expenses for a sixacre portion of the facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former operators we began the stabilization process in 1996 and completed it in 1999 we paid all remediation and related costs from the 30 million fund and in accordance with the acquisition agreement distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller of the dallas facility less 200000 which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the nofurtheraction letter in september 2002 our environmental engineering consultant issued a report which concludes that the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized the leadimpacted soil and that the concrete cap should prevent impact to storm water and subsequent surface water impact our consultant thereafter submitted an operations and maintenance plan “plan” to the texas commission on environmental quality “tceq” providing for a twoyear inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap and a twoyear ground and surface water monitoring plan in january of 2003 the tceq approved the plan subject to the additions of upstream background surface water samples from the intermittent stream adjacent to the facility and documentation of any repairs to the concrete cap during the post closuremonitoring period the first semiannual water sampling was conducted in april 2003 which reflected that the leadimpacted stabilized soil is not 13 impacting the ground andor surface water the second round of semiannual water samples collected in october and november 2003 reported concentration of lead in one storm water and one surface water sample in excess of the established upstream criteria for lead in correspondence which we received in july 2004 the tceq approved with comment our water monitoring report dated february 24 2004 the tceq instructed us to continue with postclosure monitoring and maintenance activities and submit the next report in accordance with the approved schedules if the tests conducted for the remainder of the twoyear monitoring period provided for in the plan demonstrate that the leadimpacted stabilized soil is not materially impacting the ground andor surface water a nofurtheraction letter will be requested at that time we are not assured of receiving the nofurtheraction letter and we may incur further liabilities if the stabilization process proves ineffective in addition in 1994 we detected a small quantity of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater monitoring well at the dallas facility our environmental consultants concluded that both substances arose from an offsite source and no further action was recommended 

  we do not believe that any of the above environmental matters will either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

governmental regulations   our operations are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal provincial state and local statutes ordinances and regulations the acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by state and provincial motor vehicle departments in addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our auction and storage facilities these zoning requirements vary from location to location at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets 

legal proceedings   we are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business such as actions related to injuries property damage or handling or disposal of vehicles among this litigation is a lawsuit filed in massachusetts against us which purports to be a class action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by us as abandoned vehicles which the claimant contends were disposed of without complying with state laws   we are also involved in various governmental and administrative proceedings primarily relating to licensing and operation of our business we provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated the effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters while it is not feasible to determine the outcome of these matters management believes that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 14 

factors that may affect future results we depend on a limited number of major suppliers of salvage vehicles the loss of one or more of these major suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates   historically a limited number of vehicle suppliers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues in fiscal 2004 vehicles supplied by our two largest suppliers accounted for approximately 12 and 8 of our revenues respectively supplier arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice vehicle suppliers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for auction services in those markets there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle suppliers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle supplier or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a substantial vehicle supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates our strategic shift from live salvage auctions to an entirely internet based sales model presents new risks including substantial technology risks   in fiscal 2004 we converted all our salvage auctions from a live auction process to an entirely internet based auctionstyle model based on technology developed internally by us the conversion represents a significant change in the way we conduct business and presents numerous risks including our increased reliance on the availability and reliability of our network systems in particular we believe the conversion presents the following risks among others  15 factors such as mild weather conditions in the united states can have an adverse affect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates   mild weather conditions in the united states tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged accordingly mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings and related growth rates and could have an adverse effect on our operating results conversely our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weatherrelated conditions such as flooding during periods of mild weather conditions our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle suppliers and to compete more effectively in the market each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections the salvage vehicle auction industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully   we face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles we believe our principal competitors include other vehicle auction companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other suppliers and large vehicle dismantlers who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies bypassing the salvage auction process many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive auction companies and large dismantlers many of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us due to the limited number of vehicle suppliers the absence of longterm contractual commitments between us and our suppliers and the increasingly competitive market environment there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense   we may also encounter significant competition for local regional and national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers there can be no assurance that the existence of other local regional or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans furthermore we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of salvage vehicle auction facilities which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses organized salvage vehicle buying groups automobile manufacturers automobile auctioneers and software companies while most vehicle suppliers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us there can be no assurance that this trend will continue which could adversely affect our market share results of operations and financial condition additionally existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us therefore there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new salvage vehicle auction facilities the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and development of new facilities   we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle auction facilities and the development of new salvage vehicle auction facilities there can be no assurance that we will be able to  16  as we continue to expand our operations our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   our ability to manage growth is not only dependent on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities but also on our ability to    our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have limited experience in the public automobile auction business and may not be successful in our efforts to compete in this market which may adversely affect our current growth strategy   we have historically focused on the operation acquisition and development of salvage vehicle auction facilities and only have limited experience in operating public automobile auction facilities the public automobile auction market differs from the salvage vehicle auction market in that used vehicles in general working order are sold to the public we intend to expand our public automobile auction facilities through the acquisition of public auction sites and the successful implementation of vb 2 and cannot know whether our existing salvage auction business model will translate successfully into the public automobile auction market to the extent that we cannot successfully compete in the public automobile auction market our growth strategy could be harmed our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate causing the price of our stock to decline   our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors many of which are beyond our control factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the following  17    due to the foregoing factors our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate as a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors the price of our common stock could decline substantially government regulation of the salvage vehicle auction industry may impair our operations increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability   participants in the salvage vehicle auction industry are subject to and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of us or canadian federal state provincial and local governmental regulatory and administrative rules regulations land use ordinances licensure requirements and procedures including those governing vehicle registration the environment zoning and land use failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities at various times we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development andor operation of our business facilities we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements we may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal provincial state and local governmental agencies in new markets in addition new regulatory requirements or 18 changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles 

the operation of our auction facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the salvage vehicle auction industry large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at auction facilities and during that time spills of fuel motor oil and other fluids may occur resulting in soil surface water or groundwater contamination environmental issues resulting from fuel spills oil spillage or similar problems are also present at our public auction facilities in addition certain of our facilities generate andor store petroleum products and other hazardous materials including waste solvents and used oil we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or the disposal of our waste at offsite locations environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future although we have obtained indemnification for preexisting environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if we experience problems with our providers of fleet operations our business could be harmed   we rely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our auction facilities our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand which could have a material adverse effect on our business further an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers which may significantly increase our cost these costs may not be passed on to our sellers or buyers we are partially selfinsured for certain losses   we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted further we rely on independent experts to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these selfinsured exposures if these experts provide guidance based on erroneous assumptions use models mathematically flawed or otherwise provide advice that is inaccurate or unrepresentative then it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations our executive officers directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other shareholders   our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 21 of our common stock as of july 31 2004 if they were to act together these shareholders would have significant influence over 19 most matters requiring approval by shareholders including the election of directors any amendments to our articles of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions including potential merger or acquisition transactions in addition without the consent of these shareholders we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors these shareholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors 

we have a shareholder rights plan or poison pill which could affect the price of our common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest or to acquire us   in march 2003 our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan commonly known as a poison pill the poison pill may discourage delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities initiating a tender offer or proxy contest or acquiring us through an acquisition merger or similar transaction such an acquirer could be prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives   our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team all of whom are employed on an atwill basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete if we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees in particular willis j johnson our chief executive officer and a jayson adair our president or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and time consuming   the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley requires among other things that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for board and audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies their chief executive officers and chief financial officers for securities law violations in addition the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is traded has adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations will increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations these new rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee in the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls or if these internal controls over financial reporting are not effective our business and our stock price could suffer   section 404 of sarbanesoxley requires companies to do a comprehensive and costly evaluation of their internal controls as a result during our fiscal year ending july 31 2005 we will be required to perform an evaluation of our 20 internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor publicly attest to such evaluation we have prepared an internal plan of action for compliance which includes a timeline and scheduled activities with respect to preparation of such evaluation our efforts to comply with section 404 and related regulations regarding our management’s required assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors’ attestation of that assessment has required and continues to require the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources while we anticipate being able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section 404 in a timely fashion we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations since there is no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy if we fail to timely complete this evaluation or if our auditors cannot timely attest to our evaluation we could be subject to regulatory investigations or sanctions costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our internal controls which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend special note regarding forwardlooking statements   this report including the information incorporated by reference herein contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 in some cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terms such as “may” “will” “should” “expect” “plan” “intend” “forecast” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “predict” “potential” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology the forwardlooking statements contained in this report involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and situations that may cause our or our industry’s actual results level of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements these factors include those listed under the caption “factors that may affect future results” beginning on page 15 of this report and those discussed elsewhere in this report we encourage investors to review these factors carefully   although we believe that based on information currently available to copart and its management the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements overview   we provide vehicle suppliers primarily insurance companies with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers rebuilders repair licensees used vehicle dealers and exporters salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimize administrative and processing costs we generate revenues primarily from auction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage   we process salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method on either the percentage incentive program “pip” or on a fixed fee consignment basis using either consignment method only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue   for the fiscal years ended july 31 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 65 67 and 67 of the vehicles we sold respectively were processed under pip we attempt to convert vehicle supplier agreements at acquired operations to pip which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment programs those vehicles not sold under the pip program were processed under fixed fee agreements   due to a number of factors including the timing and size of new acquisitions market conditions and acceptance of pip by vehicle suppliers the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs in future periods may vary   our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include fees under pip agreements and fixed fee programs where we charge for title processing special preparation storage and selling salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles storage and annual registration transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under fixed fee contracts transportation revenue also includes towing charges 27 assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our auctions for vehicles processed that we own 

  costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management clerical and yard employees rent contract vehicle towing insurance fuel fleet maintenance and repair and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive accounting and data processing sales personnel human resources professional fees and marketing expenses   during fiscal 2004 we converted all of our salvage vehicle auction facilities to an internet based auctionstyle model using our virtual bidding second generation “vb 2 ” internet sales technology this second generation technology combines two bidding processes an open preliminary bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the auction facility during the three preview days or over the internet to improve the effectiveness of bidding the vb 2 system lets a buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase the preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and bid4u will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an internetonly virtual sale bid4u will represent the high preliminary bidder at the internetonly virtual sale this feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder the bidders enter bids via the internet in a real time format bid4u submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid when bidding stops a countdown is initiated if no bids are received during the countdown the vehicle sells to the highest bidder vb 2 opens our sales process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have internet access   we believe the implementation of vb 2 across our salvage operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for salvage from us it has also improved the efficiency of our operations for fiscal 2004 sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted for 41 of total vehicles sold 24 of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 17 were sold to buyers out of country   the periodtoperiod comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions and new openings made by us during such periods acquisitions and new operations   we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired twelve vehicle auction facilities and established twelve new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2002 all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting   as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions as well as the regions currently served by our facilities as part of this strategy in fiscal 2004 we acquired new facilities in or near eugene oregon cleveland ohio and anchorage alaska and opened new facilities in or near toronto canada and helena montana in fiscal 2003 we acquired new facilities in or near pittsburgh pennsylvania reno nevada and richmond virginia and opened new facilities in or near springfield missouri corpus christi texas ft pierce florida rancho cucamonga california richmond virginia and albany new york in fiscal 2002 we acquired new facilities in or near new castle delaware savannah georgia tifton georgia charleston west virginia haslet texas and greencastle pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near lyman 28 maine tucson arizona somerville new jersey and amarillo texas we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have 107 facilities located in north america and are able to provide national coverage for our suppliers 

  we seek to increase revenues and profitability by among other things i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key markets ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers iv increasing revenue and profitability at our public automobile auction facilities and v expanding the application of vb 2 into new markets in addition we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to vehicle pooling costs allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill income taxes and longlived assets we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements   we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard and fleet expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard and fleet expenses of the period the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs labor transportation and vehicle processing if our allocation factors change then yard and fleet expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis   we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments if billing disputes exceed expectations andor if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required   we evaluate separately the impairment of goodwill of our salvage and our public auction operating segments annually by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value in prior years we evaluated impairment of goodwill at the facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value during fiscal 2004 when we centralized the auction process with the implementation of vb 2  we determined the appropriate level for testing for impairment was at the salvage and public auction levels under this accounting policy we have not recognized any charges for the impairment of goodwill in previous years or the current year future adverse changes in 29 market conditions or poor operating results of an operating segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 

  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of the company’s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets the company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income accordingly the company has established a valuation allowance when in certain taxable jurisdictions the utilization of the tax asset is uncertain additional timing differences future earning trends andor tax strategies may occur which could warrant a need for establishing an additional valuation allowance or a reserve   we are also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year   we evaluate longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows change in the future we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset in the future   we are partially selfinsured for certain losses related to general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trends including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation differ from our estimates our results of operations could be impacted 30 results of operations   the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenues there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future    fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003   revenues were approximately 4008 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 534 million or 15 over fiscal 2003 the increase was due primarily to increased salvage vehicle volume new service revenue and higher fees resulting from increased auction proceeds per vehicle we believe the increase in proceeds per vehicle was the result of the introduction of virtual bidding second generation “vb 2 ” as more buyers are able to participate in the auctions existing facilities contributed approximately 520 million of new revenue and new facilities identified below contributed approximately 14 million of new revenue   new facilities in or near toronto canada eugene oregon helena montana cleveland ohio and anchorage alaska contributed approximately 14 million of new revenue during fiscal 2004   yard and fleet expenses were approximately 2088 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 63 million or 3 over fiscal 2003 included in yard and fleet expense is a net adjustment to insurance reserves that decreased this expense by 44 million the increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities approximately 21 million of the increase was the result of the acquisition and opening of new facilities yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities excluding the 44 million favorable adjustment to reserves grew by approximately 86 million or 4 yard and fleet expenses decreased to 52 of revenues during fiscal 2004 as compared to 58 of revenues during fiscal 2003 yard and fleet expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue and was due in part to the fixed cost nature of copart’s business the decrease in yard and fleet expenses as a percentage or revenue was offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses were approximately 365 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 78 million or 27 over fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to increases in software development cost technology hardware leasing cost and it payroll costs all directly associated with the development 31 and deployment of vb 2  in addition the company saw increases in the cost of professional services impacted by sarbanesoxley compliance and increased payroll and benefit costs associated with expanded support headcount general and administrative expenses increased to 9 of revenues during fiscal 2004 as compared to 8 of revenues during fiscal 2003 

  depreciation and amortization expense was approximately 308 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 53 million or 21 over fiscal 2003 this increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new auction facilities   total other income was approximately 55 million during fiscal 2004 an increase of approximately 21 million or 62 from fiscal 2003 gain on sale of fleet equipment represents the gain on the sale of 602 vehicles the sale of the equipment is associated with the company’s decision to replace its company owned trucks with subhaulers for its towing services interest income decreased approximately 01 million due to lower interest rates during the first nine months of the fiscal year other income which consists primarily of rental income increased approximately 11 million as the company rented several underutilized facilities   our effective combined federal state and local income tax rate for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was approximately 39   due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 792 million for fiscal 2004 compared to net income of approximately 572 million for fiscal 2003   fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002   revenues were approximately 3474 million during fiscal 2003 an increase of approximately 310 million or 10 over fiscal 2002 the increase was due primarily to increased volume at existing facilities which contributed approximately 241 million in revenue and to new facilities identified below which contributed approximately 69 million of new revenue   new facilities in or near west mifflin pennsylvania reno nevada richmond virginia springfield missouri corpus christi texas ft pierce florida rancho cucamonga california richmond virginia and albany new york contributed approximately 69 million of new revenue during fiscal 2003   yard and fleet expenses were approximately 2024 million during fiscal 2003 an increase of approximately 155 million or 8 over fiscal 2002 the increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities approximately 73 million of the increase was the result of the opening and operating of new facilities yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities grew by approximately 82 million or 4 compared to existing facility revenue growth of approximately 241 million or 8 yard and fleet expenses decreased to 58 of revenues during fiscal 2003 as compared to 59 of revenues during fiscal 2002   general and administrative expenses were approximately 287 million during fiscal 2003 an increase of approximately 54 million or 23 over fiscal 2002 this increase was due primarily to an increase of approximately 25 million in payroll expense 10 million in professional services 06 million in frame connectivity charges and 13 million in various other general and administrative items general and administrative expenses increased to 8 of revenues during fiscal 2003 as compared to 7 of revenues during fiscal 2002 32   depreciation and amortization expense was approximately 255 million during fiscal 2003 an increase of approximately 92 million or 57 over fiscal 2002 this increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new auction facilities growth in capital spending in fiscal 2003 and prior periods is expected to result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods   total other income was approximately 34 million during fiscal 2003 a decrease of approximately 03 million or 8 from fiscal 2002 the decrease is due primarily to a reduction in the gain from the sale of certain fixed assets of approximately 05 million interest income decreased approximately 02 million due to lower interest rates and a reduction in the cash balance these decreases were offset by an increase in rental income of approximately 04 million   our effective combined federal state and local income tax rate for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was 39   due to the foregoing factors we realized net income of approximately 572 million for fiscal 2003 compared to net income of approximately 574 million for fiscal 2002 liquidity and capital resources   historically we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations public offerings of common stock the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 616 million in fiscal 2004 and decreased by approximately 159 million in fiscal 2003 our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially affected by inflation during the winter months most of our facilities process 10 to 30 more vehicles than at other times of the year this increased seasonal volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business   as of july 31 2004 we had working capital of approximately 2299 million including cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1783 million our primary source of cash is from the collection of sellers’ fees buyers’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles   we believe that our currently available cash cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and equipment leasing lines will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months however if we experience significant growth in the future we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 

 

   net cash provided by operating activities increased by 361 million from fiscal 2003 to 1152 million in fiscal 2004 due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items and profitability of the company 

 

   capital expenditures excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were approximately 646 million 707 million and 859 million for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively our capital expenditures have related primarily to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment in addition in fiscal 2004 the company sold most of its transportation fleet as it moved to outsource this function sale of fleet equipment generated approximately 190 million in gross proceeds 33   during the fiscal year ended july 31 2004 we used cash for the acquisition of operations in eugene oregon cleveland ohio and anchorage alaska which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately 47 million during the fiscal year ended july 31 2003 we used cash for the acquisition of operations in west mifflin pennsylvania reno nevada and richmond virginia which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately 66 million during the fiscal year ended july 31 2002 we used cash and common stock for the acquisition of operations in new castle delaware savannah georgia tifton georgia charleston west virginia haslet texas and greencastle pennsylvania the consideration paid consisted of an aggregate cash cost of approximately 86 million and approximately 257 million in common stock   during fiscal year ended july 31 2002 we used common stock to purchase an existing facility which we were leasing the consideration paid consisted of approximately 23 million in common stock
