business segments 

we operate as one operating segment our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members see note 12 segment and geographic information  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail 

competition 

the market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change we compete against other entertainment video providers such as multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” streaming entertainment providers including those that provide pirated content video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time we also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service both for licensed content and for original content projects 

while consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time we have often referred to this choice as our objective of winning moments of 

truth in attempting to win these moments of truth with our members we are continually improving our service including both our technology and our content which is increasingly exclusive and curated and includes our original programming 

seasonality 

our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internetconnected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing historically the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth in addition our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing 

intellectual property 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service we use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content merchandising our products and marketing our service our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights including distribution rights to such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes 

regulation 

the media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action historically media has been highly regulated in many countries we are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours in particular we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like netflix this includes content quotas levies and investment obligations some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content in certain countries regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of andor adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country in general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offering we may provide 

human capital 

we view our employees and our culture as key to our success as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 11300 fulltime employees located globally in 60 countries of these 8600 76 were located in the united states and canada 1400 12 in europe middle east and africa 400 4 in latin america and 900 8 in asiapacific we also have a number of employees engaged in content production some of whom are parttime or temporary and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year 

we believe a critical component of our success is our company culture this culture which is detailed in a culture memo located on our website is often described as a highperformance culture of freedom and responsibility we aim to attract and retain great people  representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills  to work together as a dream team we empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decisionmaking each employee has the freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role in return our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions with this approach we believe we are a more flexible fun stimulating creative collaborative and successful organization 

as we have expanded our offices globally our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations we have also become mindful of cultural differences across and within regions fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us we employ a team reporting to our vp of inclusion strategy who works to build diversity inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each netflix employee carries out their role we want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen  so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve our inclusion team helps increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks we also support numerous employee resource groups ergs representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented andor marginalized communities our 

ergs are important in creating a more inclusive environment for all employees allowing space to connect on shared experiences providing mentoring career development and volunteering opportunities we publish an inclusion report annually which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion as well as publishing our eeo1 reports on our website 

  

we believe in fostering great leaders we employ a vp of leadership programs whose team’s mission is to design programs such as seminars and lectures that help our leaders officers vps and directorlevel employees examine values that guide them personally and as leaders especially when those values come into tension with the world around us the goal of these programs is to create great human beings who become great leaders who shape a great company we also employ a learning and development team that programs workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics such as leading and inspiring teams we believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and wellrounded individuals and better positions netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world 

  

we aim to pay our employees at the top of their personal market and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options this permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employees individual needs and preferences we have conducted pay equity analyses and adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender globally and race us relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances we also practice “open compensation” which means the top leaders directorlevel and above at the company can see how much any employee is paid this encourages open discussions about pay disparities throughout the company we aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through these approaches 

  

we care about the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region including health benefits in the us each employee receives an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them employees have access to a host of other benefits including mental health childcare family planning and a company match for charitable donations 

we believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth and has made netflix a desirable destination for employees

 item 1a risk factors 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service in countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices effectively drive conversation around our content and service as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying tv series documentaries feature films and mobile games furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships competitors include other entertainment video providers such as mvpds and streaming entertainment providers including those that provide pirated content video gaming providers as well as usergenerated content and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time 

if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or service offerings or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members we have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games if our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted we may from time to time adjust our membership pricing our membership plans or our pricing model itself which may not be wellreceived by consumers and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service in addition many of our members rejoin our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved membership growth is also impacted by seasonality with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth as well as the timing of our content release schedules we must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base while we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for noncommercial purposes if multihousehold usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multihousehold usage are ineffective our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted if we do not grow as expected given in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per membership revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships our business will be adversely affected 

changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change through new and existing distribution channels consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market piracy in particular threatens to damage our business as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against virtually all content for free furthermore in light of the compelling consumer proposition piracy services are subject to rapid global growth traditional providers of entertainment video including broadcasters and cable network operators as well as internet based ecommerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings several of these competitors have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition exclusive rights to certain content large content libraries and significant financial marketing and other resources they may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development technology infrastructure content acquisitions and marketing new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete 

with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

the ongoing coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the various responses to it has disrupted our business increased our costs led to delays in content releases and may continue to impact our business and results of operations 

the ongoing coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the various responses to it have created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption the full extent to which the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the effect on our members and consumer demand for and ability to pay for our services disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel and any stoppages disruptions or increased costs associated with our development production postproduction marketing and distribution of original programming such production pauses have in the past and may in the future cause us to delay content releases and temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters while most of our productions have resumed certain of our productions continue to experience disruption as do the productions of our thirdparty content suppliers other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development production and postproduction of content production disruptions can result in additional costs to production including additional pay to cast and crew also covidrelated delays and production protocols and requirements including use of ppe and testing add to costs of production 

we will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the covid19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations including content production as may be required by federal state local or foreign authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees members partners and stockholders it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our members suppliers or vendors or on our financial results 

in addition to the potential direct impacts to our business the global economy may continue to be impacted as a result of the actions taken in response to covid19 to the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors’ ability to provide services to us especially those related to our content productions we could see our business and results of operations negatively impacted 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a producer and distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright and trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials we are devoting more resources toward the development production marketing and distribution of original programming including tv series documentaries feature films and mobile games we believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members to the extent our programming does not meet our expectations in particular in terms of costs viewing and popularity our business including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted as we have expanded our original programming we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we also take on risks associated with production such as completion and key talent risk which risks have been heightened during covid19 further negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions we contract with third parties related to the development production marketing and distribution of our original programming we may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior to the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming andor license such rights to third parties we could become subject to product liability intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise we may decide to remove content from our service not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand or business 

to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service or if we become liable for content we acquire produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising 

from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service as well as scaling our ability to program and produce original content introducing games on our service as our international offering evolves we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and streaming video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty “cloud” computing services as we scale our content production including now games we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines including creative marketing legal finance licensing merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content further we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers as we grow our operations we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our corporate culture as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content our business may be adversely affected 

if we fail to maintain or in newer markets establish a positive reputation concerning our service including the content we offer we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members to the extent our content in particular our original programming is perceived as low quality offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted to the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior including being required to remove such content from our service our entire service could be banned andor become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations we could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business furthermore to the extent our response to government action or our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted with newer markets we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted 

our business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

from time to time we acquire or invest in businesses content and technologies that support our business the risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include the difficulty of integrating solutions operations and personnel inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies and diversion of management’s time and attention among other acquisitionrelated risks 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments and could negatively impact our financial results 

we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected devices including tvs digital video players tv settop boxes and mobile devices we have agreements with various cable satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the tv settop boxes of these service providers some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers in many instances our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service if partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch for example through multiservice discovery interfaces our service may be adversely impacted we intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream tv series documentaries and feature films to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing regulatory business or 

other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted 

our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices or if we discontinue support for certain devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to payment processing risk 

our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards gift cards prepaid cards direct debit online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing we rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules regulations and industry standards including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are increases in payment processing fees material changes in the payment ecosystem such as large reissuances of payment cards delays in receiving payments from payment processors changes to rules regulations or industry standards concerning payments loss of payment partners andor disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems partner systems or payment products including products we use to update payment information our revenue operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted in certain instances we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf if these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention in addition from time to time we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service if we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels card networks may impose fines our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements the termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business as our service and others like us gain traction in international markets governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services in particular those related to broadcast media and tax for example european law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction several jurisdictions have and others may over time impose financial and regulatory obligations on us in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries including across the european union in others the laws may be nascent or nonexistent furthermore favorable laws may change including for example in the united states where net neutrality regulations were repealed given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us these matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content patent infringement claims tax litigation employment related litigation as well as consumer and securities class actions each of which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses result in content unavailability service disruptions and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position we also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities while the ultimate outcome of investigations inquiries information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict such matters can be expensive timeconsuming and distracting and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in among other things modification of our business practices reputational harm or costs and significant payments any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

risks related to intellectual property 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us including distribution rights to such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary as content providers develop their own streaming services they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content including popular series or movies if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected andor our costs could increase certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions and other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we see the cost of certain programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations “cmos” and similar entities that hold certain rights to music andor other interests in intellectual property eg remuneration rights in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain cmos and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with cmos or result in music publishers represented by certain cmos unilaterally withdrawing rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs additionally as the market for the digital distribution of content grows a broader role for cmos in the remuneration of authors performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any copyrights patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties the value of our brand content and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the 

perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our website streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes our content and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service we use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content merchandising our products and marketing our service from time to time third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current website streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products we may also have to remove content from our service or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our content merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

risks related to information technology 

any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyberattacks could result in a loss or degradation of service unauthorized disclosure of data including member and corporate information or theft of intellectual property including digital content assets which could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from among other things earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks rogue employees power loss telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats including cyberattacks such as computer viruses denial of service attacks physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of personal information of third parties employees and our members and other data confidential information or intellectual property additionally outside parties may attempt to induce employees vendors partners or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data any attempt by hackers to obtain our data including member and corporate information or intellectual property including digital content assets disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems however the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving and we may be unable to anticipate detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur because of our prominence we andor third parties we use may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks and from time to time we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets however to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service systems or business there is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems 

are expensive to develop implement and maintain these efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation further a penetration of our systems or a thirdparty’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business regulatory litigation and reputation risk which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty provider in addition we utilize thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv series documentaries and feature films and offer mobile games in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty “cloud” computing or other network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services “aws” provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service although if it were to do so it could harm our business 

if the technology we use in operating our business fails is unavailable or does not operate to expectations our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we utilize a combination of proprietary and thirdparty technology to operate our business this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices for example we have built and deployed our own contentdelivery network “cdn” to the extent internet service providers “isps” do not interconnect with our cdn or charge us to access their networks or if we experience difficulties in our cdn’s operation our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected likewise if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected we also utilize thirdparty technology to help market our service process payments and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business if our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly including as a result of “bugs” or other errors in our development and deployment of software our ability to operate our service retain existing members and add new members may be impaired any harm to our members’ devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet if network operators block restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks our service and business could be negatively affected to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted the extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets 

risks related to privacy 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personal information and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize information supplied by our members which may include personal information and other data we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection use and security of personal information including but not limited to regulation eu 2016679 also known as the general data protection regulation or “gdpr” and the california privacy rights act cpra any actual or perceived failure to comply with the gdpr the ccpacpra other data privacy laws or regulations or related contractual or other obligations or any perceived privacy rights violation could lead to investigations claims and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties damages for contract breach and other significant costs penalties and other liabilities as well as harm to our reputation and market position 

other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect transfer and use information and other data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose information and other data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information such as laws regarding data localization andor restrictions on data export failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information and other data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal information and other data regarding our members including names and billing information this information and data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations with respect to billing information such as credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data despite these measures and technologies we our payment processing services or other thirdparty services we use such as aws could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members we also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach including various state attorneys general one or more eu data protection authorities or other data protection authorities as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods additionally we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach we also maintain personal information and other data concerning our employees as well as personal information of others working on our productions should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and other data andor production personal information occur our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted 

risks related to liquidity 

the longterm and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

in connection with licensing streaming content we typically enter into multiyear commitments with studios and other content providers we also enter into multiyear commitments for content that we produce either directly or through third parties including elements associated with these productions such as noncancelable commitments under talent agreements the payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base “fixed cost” but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments to the extent estimable under accounting standards are included in the contractual obligations section of part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 7 commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be 

adversely impacted payment terms for certain content commitments such as content we directly produce will typically require more upfront cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content to the extent membership andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate if we license andor produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory or is unable to be shown in a territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities for several years prior to 2020 our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital the decision to obtain additional capital will depend on among other things our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution any large equity or equitylinked offering could also negatively impact our stock price 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations which could adversely affect our financial position 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations moreover we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations including additional streaming content obligations if the financial markets become difficult or costly to access our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted as of december 31 2021 we had the equivalent of 155 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding “notes” some of which is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a 1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 74 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet some of which is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition the amounts of which are significant for more information on our streaming content obligations including those not on our consolidated balance sheet see note 7 commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k our substantial indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations may 

• make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our notes and our other obligations 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds if needed for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general business purposes 

• increase our cost of borrowing 

• limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general business purposes 

• require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due 

• limit our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors and 

• increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 

our streaming obligations include large multiyear commitments as a result we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the nearterm this could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time which may negatively impact our stock price 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations 

our ability to make payments on our debt including our notes and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control for several years prior to 2020 our cash flows from operations were negative we may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our debt including the notes and other obligations including amounts due under our streaming content obligations 

if we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations if our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations when due if it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to international operations 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic political regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 

• the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences 

• difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations 

• political or social unrest and economic instability 

• compliance with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws export controls and economic sanctions and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials 

• difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions including local ownership requirements for streaming content providers 

• regulatory requirements or government action against our service whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise that results in disruption or nonavailability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction 

• foreign intellectual property laws such as the eu copyright directive or changes to such laws which may be less favorable than us law and among other issues may impact the economics of creating or distributing content antipiracy efforts or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights 

• adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which will impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 

• profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds 

• differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods such as payment cards 

• new and different sources of competition 

• censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content leading to consumer disappointment brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service 

• low usage andor penetration of internetconnected consumer electronic devices 

• different and more stringent user protection data protection privacy and other laws including data localization andor restrictions on data export and local ownership requirements 

• availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion 

• differing and often more lenient laws and consumer understandingattitudes regarding the illegality of piracy 

• negative impacts from trade disputes and 

• implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and tv series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity including local content quotas investment obligations and levies to support local film funds for example the european union revised its audio visual media services directive in 2018 to require that european works comprise at least thirty percent 30 of media service providers’ catalogs and to require prominence of those works 

our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our global provision for taxes 

tax laws are being reexamined and evaluated globally new laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions the us federal and state governments countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

risks related to human resources 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our cochief executive officers reed hastings and ted sarandos members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highlyskilled business product development technical creative and other personnel if we experience high executive turnover fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations fail to implement succession plans for key employees are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel in instilling our culture in new employees or improving our culture as we grow our operations may be disrupted 

labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

our partners suppliers vendors and we employ the services of writers directors actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry both in the us and internationally expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us if expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production added costs or by reducing profit margins 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable although we have announced plans to modify some of these provisions over time 

our charter documents in their current form may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

• authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue up to 10000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock 

• provide for a classified board of directors 

• prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent 

• establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings and 

• prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders 

we have announced plans to eliminate the classified structure of our board of directors subject to stockholder approval which may not be forthcoming and also to revise the current director election standard and to permit holders of our stock to call a special meeting of stockholders 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

• variations in our operating results including our membership acquisition and retention revenues operating income net income net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 

• variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts investors and the financial community 

• announcements of developments affecting our business systems or expansion plans by us or others 

• competition including the introduction of new competitors their pricing strategies and services 

• market volatility in general 

• the level of demand for our stock including the amount of short interest in our stock 

• the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt 

• the operating results of our competitors and 

• other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors 

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues operating margins net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock in addition the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united 

states of america also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods we base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances but actual results may differ from these estimates for example we estimate the content amortization pattern beginning with the month of first availability of any particular licensed or produced television series documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns if actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates the pattern andor period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization if we revise such estimates it could result in greater inperiod expenses which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price further events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast for example the covid19 pandemic has disrupted historical acquisition and retention patterns and has made forecasting more difficult

results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 19 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 due to the 11 growth in average paying memberships and a 7 increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership the increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates paid net membership additions for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased 50 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 our service continues to grow globally with over 90 of the paid net membership additions for the year ended december 31 2021 coming from outside the united states and canada ucan region 

the increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19 increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the covid19 pandemic 

the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict see item 1a risk factors section set forth in this annual report on form 10k for additional details while most of our productions have resumed certain of our productions continue to experience disruption as do the productions of our thirdparty content suppliers other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development production and postproduction of content production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of ppe and testing we will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the covid19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state local or foreign authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and stockholders it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our members suppliers or vendors or on our financial results 

streaming revenues 

  

we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members we offer a variety of streaming membership plans the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan as of december 31 

2021 pricing on our paid plans ranged from the us dollar equivalent of 2 to 27 per month we expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations 

the following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

united states and canada ucan 



europe middle east and africa emea 



latin america latam

1 a paid membership also referred to as a paid subscription is defined as a membership that has the right to receive netflix service following signup and a method of payment being provided and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the company to new or rejoining members a membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period involuntary cancellations as a result of a failed method of payment become effective immediately memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of signup as determined by the company’s internal systems which utilize industry standard geolocation technology 

2 we believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership in order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prioryear period for the year ended december 31 2021 our revenues would have been approximately 443 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended december 31 2020 

cost of revenues 

amortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues expenses directly associated with the acquisition licensing and production of content such as payroll and related personnel expenses costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content overall deals with talent miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues we have built our own global content delivery network “open connect” to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet delivery expenses therefore include equipment costs related to open connect payroll and related personnel expenses and all thirdparty costs such as cloud computing costs associated with delivering content over the internet other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees including those we pay to our integrated payment partners as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members 



the increase in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to a 1423 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content including more exclusive and original programming other costs of revenues increased 633 million primarily due to the continued growth in our content production activities coupled with an increase in expenses associated with streaming delivery costs and payment processing fees driven by our growing member base the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from 61 to 58 is primarily due to delays in content releases due to the covid19 pandemic resulting in content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the growth in revenue 

marketing 

marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners including consumer electronics ce manufacturers mvpds mobile operators and isps advertising expenses include 

promotional activities such as digital and television advertising marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support marketing activities 



the increase in marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to a 222 million increase in advertising expenses partially offset by increased payments to our marketing partners in addition personnelrelated costs increased 116 million primarily due to growth in average headcount to support the increase in our production activity and continued improvements in our streaming service 

technology and development 

technology and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for technology personnel responsible for making improvements to our service offerings including testing maintaining and modifying our user interface our recommendations merchandising and infrastructure technology and development expenses also include costs associated with general use computer hardware and software 

  



the increase in technology and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to a 384 million increase in personnelrelated costs primarily due to growth in average headcount to support the increase in our production activity and continued improvements in our streaming service 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for corporate personnel general and administrative expenses also include professional fees and other general corporate expenses 



the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to a 187 million increase in personnelrelated costs primarily due to growth in average headcount to support the increase in our production activity and continued improvements in our streaming service in addition thirdparty expenses including costs for contractors and consultants increased 66 million 

interest expense 

interest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding debt obligations including the amortization of debt issuance costs see note 6 debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for further detail on our debt obligations 

  



interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 consisted primarily of 747 million of interest on our notes interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 remained flat 

interest and other income expense 

interest and other income expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 



interest and other income expense increased primarily due to foreign exchange gains of 403 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to a loss of 660 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the foreign exchange gain in the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily driven by the noncash 431 million gain from the remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies the foreign exchange loss in the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by the noncash 533 million loss from the remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies 

provision for income taxes 

the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 is primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the california rd credit in the year ended december 31 2020 offset primarily by a lower benefit on a percentage basis from excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

in 2021 the difference between our 12 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation and the impact of international provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act 

liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased 2184 million in the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to acquisitions the repurchase of stock purchases of property and equipment and repayment of debt partially offset by cash provided by operations 

debt net of debt issuance costs decreased 916 million primarily due to the repayment upon maturity of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5375 senior notes in february 2021 coupled with the remeasurement of our eurodenominated notes the amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is 1408 million the amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is 18638 million as of december 31 2021 no amounts had been borrowed under our 1 billion revolving credit agreement see note 6 debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 

we anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

in march 2021 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 billion of our common stock with no expiration date stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with rule 10b18 under the exchange act including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b51 under the exchange act privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated stock repurchase plans block purchases or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including our stock price general economic business and market conditions and alternative investment opportunities we may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice as of december 31 2021 the company has repurchased 1182410 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of 600 million as of december 31 2021 44 billion remains available for repurchases 

our primary uses of cash include the acquisition licensing and production of content marketing programs streaming delivery and personnelrelated costs cash payment terms for nonoriginal content are in line with the amortization period investments in original content and in particular content that we produce and own require more cash upfront relative to licensed content for example production costs are paid as the content is created well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized we expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content particularly in original content we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations available funds and access to financing sources including our revolving credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond 

our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content debt and lease obligations expected timing of those payments are as follows 



  

1 as of december 31 2021 content obligations were comprised of 43 billion included in current content liabilities and 31 billion of noncurrent content liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and 158 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition 

content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition licensing and production of content an obligation for the production of content includes noncancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments an obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity andor fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date traditional film output deals or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown are examples of these types of agreements the contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years however these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately 1 billion to 4 billion over the next three years with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above 

2 debt obligations include our notes consisting of principal and interest payments see note 6 debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details 

3 see note 5 balance sheet components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases as of december 31 2021 the company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of 366 million which has been included above total lease obligations as of december 31 2021 increased 677 million from 2839 million as of december 31 2020 to 3516 million as of december 31 2021 due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions 

in addition as of december 31 2021 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 203 million of which 39 million was classified in “other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at this time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like share repurchases free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow provided by used in operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense noncash remeasurement gainloss on our eurodenominated debt and other working capital differences working capital differences include deferred revenue excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation taxes and semiannual interest payments on our outstanding debt our receivables from members generally settle quickly 



net cash provided by operating activities decreased 2034 million from the year ended december 31 2020 to 393 million for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily driven by an increase in investments in content that require more 

upfront cash payments partially offset by a 4702 million or 19 increase in revenues the payments for content assets increased 4933 million from 12537 million to 17469 million or 39 as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of 1423 million from 10807 million to 12230 million or 13 the increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion 

net cash used in investing activities increased 834 million primarily due to acquisitions 

net cash provided by used in financing activities decreased 2387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of 1002 million net of 8 million issuance costs in the year ended december 31 2020 coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of 600 million in the year ended december 31 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5375 senior notes in february 2021 

free cash flow was 5275 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to 5239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense 431 million of noncash remeasurement gain on our eurodenominated debt and 8 million other nonfavorable working capital differences partially offset by 403 million of noncash stockbased compensation expenses 

free cash flow was 840 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to 1730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and 308 million in other nonfavorable working capital differences partially offset by 533 million of noncash remeasurement loss on our eurodenominated debt 415 million of noncash stockbased compensation expenses and a 250 million noncash valuation allowance on the california rd credit

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

content 

we acquire license and produce content including original programming in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment the content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense payments for content including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities are classified within net cash provided by used in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

we recognize content assets licensed and produced as content assets net on the consolidated balance sheets for licensed content we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming for produced content we capitalize costs associated with the production including development cost direct costs and production overhead participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs 

based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns we amortize the content assets licensed and produced in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations over the shorter of each titles contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years beginning with the month of first availability the amortization is on an accelerated basis as we typically expect more upfront viewing and film amortization is more accelerated than tv 

series amortization on average over 90 of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability we review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment 

our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level content assets licensed and produced are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost to date we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances if such changes are identified in the future these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value in addition unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2021 the valuation allowance of 318 million was related to the california research and development credits and certain foreign tax attributes that we do not expect to realize 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2021 our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 203 million of which 136 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2021 our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 

as of december 31 2021 we had 155 billion of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2022 and 2030 refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in 

periods of increasing rates of interest the fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates as discussed below 

foreign currency risk 

revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar account for 57 of the consolidated amount for the year ended december 31 2021 we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies which are primarily the euro the british pound the brazilian real the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar and the japanese yen 

accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in us dollars for the year ended december 31 2021 our revenues would have been approximately 443 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended december 31 2020 

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency in the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized a 403 million foreign exchange gain primarily due to the noncash remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies 

in addition the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december 31 2021 was an decrease of 87 million 

we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

business segments 

we operate as one operating segment our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members see note 12 segment and geographic information  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail 

competition 

the market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change we compete against other entertainment video providers such as multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” streaming entertainment providers including those that provide pirated content video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time we also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service both for licensed content and for original content projects 

while consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time we have often referred to this choice as our objective of winning moments of 

truth in attempting to win these moments of truth with our members we are continually improving our service including both our technology and our content which is increasingly exclusive and curated and includes our original programming 

seasonality 

our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internetconnected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing historically the first and fourth quarters october through march represent our greatest streaming membership growth in addition our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing 

intellectual property 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service we use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content merchandising our products and marketing our service our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights including distribution rights to such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes 

regulation 

the media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action historically media has been highly regulated in many countries we are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours in particular we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like netflix this includes content quotas levies and investment obligations some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content in certain countries regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of andor adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country in general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offering we may provide 

human capital 

we view our employees and our culture as key to our success as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 9400 fulltime employees located globally in 59 countries of these 7600 81 were located in the united states and canada 1000 11 in europe middle east and africa 200 2 in latin america and 600 6 in asiapacific we also have a number of employees engaged in content production some of whom are parttime or temporary and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year 

we believe a critical component of our success is our company culture this culture which is detailed in a culture memo located on our website is often described as a highperformance culture of freedom and responsibility we aim to attract and retain great people  representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills  to work together as a dream team we empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decisionmaking each employee has the freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role in return our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions with this approach we believe we are a more flexible fun stimulating creative collaborative and successful organization 

as we have expanded our offices globally our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations we have also become mindful of cultural differences across and within regions fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us we employ a team reporting to our vp of inclusion strategy who works to build diversity inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each netflix employee carries out their role we want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen  so it’s important that our employees are diverse like the communities we serve our inclusion team helps increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks we also support numerous employee resource groups ergs representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented andor marginalized communities our ergs are important in 

creating a more inclusive environment for all employees allowing space to connect on shared experiences providing mentoring career development and volunteering opportunities and to provide the company with insight into the perspectives needs and lived experiences of the communities each erg is supported by senior leaders across the company we published our first inclusion report in january 2021 which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion 

  

we believe in fostering great leaders we employ a vp of leadership programs whose team’s mission is to design programs such as seminars and lectures that help our leaders officers vps and directorlevel employees examine values that guide them personally and as leaders especially when those values come into tension with the world around us the goal of these programs is to create great human beings who become great leaders who shape a great company we also employ a learning and development team that programs workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics such as leading and inspiring teams we believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and wellrounded individuals and better positions netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world 

  

we aim to pay our employees at the top of their personal market and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options this permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employees individual needs and preferences in 2020 we conducted a pay equity analysis and adopted practices to ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid relative to others doing the same or similar work we also practice “open compensation” which means the top leaders directorlevel and above at the company can see how much any employee is paid this encourages open discussions about pay disparities throughout the company we aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through these approaches 

  

we care about the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families each employee receives an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them if any portion of the benefit is unused the employee is paid the unused benefit as cash compensation up to 5000 employees have access to a host of other benefits including mental health childcare family planning and a company match for charitable donations we enhanced a number of these benefits to support our employees through the challenges arising from the covid19 pandemic 

we believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth and has made netflix a desirable destination for employees

 item 1a risk factors 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

the ongoing coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the global attempt to contain it may harm our industry business results of operations and ability to raise additional capital 

the global spread of the coronavirus covid19 and the various attempts to contain it have created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in an effort to contain covid19 or slow its spread governments around the world have enacted various measures some of which have been subsequently rescinded modified or reinstated including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence and practice social distancing we anticipate that these actions and the global health crisis caused by covid19 including any resurgences will continue to negatively impact business activity across the globe in response to government mandates health care advisories and otherwise responding to employee and vendor concerns we have altered certain aspects of our operations in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees our workforce has and continues to spend a significant amount of time working from home international travel has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption as are productions of our thirdparty content suppliers other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development production and postproduction of content while we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic to the extent the resulting economic disruption is severe we could see some vendors go out of business resulting in supply constraints and increased costs or delays to our productions such production pauses may cause us temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters which could negatively impact consumer demand for and member retention to our service and the number of paid memberships temporary production pauses or permanent shutdowns in production could result in content asset impairments or other charges and will change the timing and amount of cash outflows associated with production activity 

the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the availability and cost to access the capital markets the effect on our customers and customer demand for and ability to pay for our services disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel and any stoppages disruptions or increased costs associated with our development production postproduction marketing and distribution of original programming during the covid19 crisis we may not be able to provide the same level of customer service and product features that our members are used to which could negatively impact their perception of our service resulting in an increase in cancellations furthermore given increased government expenditures associated with their covid19 response we could see increased government obligations which could negatively impact our results of operations if we need to access the capital markets there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms if at all we will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the covid19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations including content production as may be required by federal state local or foreign authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and stockholders it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers suppliers or vendors or on our financial results 

the covid19 pandemic also led to an increase in our net paid membership additions relative to our quarterly forecast and historic trends in the first half of 2020 and slower net paid membership additions in the second half of 2020 relative to historic trends these results as well as those of other metrics such as revenues operating margins net income net cash provided by operating activities and other financial and operating data may not be indicative of results for future periods in addition to the potential direct impacts to our business the global economy is likely to be significantly weakened as a result of the actions taken in response to covid19 to the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors’ ability to provide services to us especially those related to our content productions we could see our business and results of operation negatively impacted 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices effectively market our service as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing tv series documentaries and feature films furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships competitors include other entertainment video providers such as mvpds and streaming entertainment providers including those that provide pirated content as well as video gaming providers and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or service offerings or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members we may from time to time adjust our membership pricing or our pricing model itself which may not be wellreceived by consumers and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service in addition many of our members rejoin our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base while we permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for noncommercial purposes if multihousehold usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multihousehold usage are ineffective our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted if we do not grow as expected given in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per membership revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of members cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members 

changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video including the potential rapid adoption of piracybased video offerings could adversely impact our business 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change through new and existing distribution channels consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market piracy in particular threatens to damage our business as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against virtually all content for free furthermore in light of the compelling consumer proposition piracy services are subject to rapid global growth traditional providers of entertainment video including broadcasters and cable network operators as well as internet based ecommerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings several of these competitors have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial marketing and other resources they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development technology infrastructure content acquisitions and marketing new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a producer and distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright and trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials we are devoting more resources toward the development production marketing and distribution of original programming including tv series documentaries and feature films we believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations in particular in terms of costs viewing and popularity our business including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted as we expand our original programming we have become responsible for production costs and 

other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we also take on risks associated with production such as completion and key talent risk negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions we contract with third parties related to the development production marketing and distribution of our original programming we may face potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these arrangements including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior to the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming andor license such rights to third parties we could become subject to product liability intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise we may decide to remove content from our service not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand or business 

to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service or if we become liable for content we acquire produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service scaling our ability to produce original content as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the us as our international offering evolves we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and streaming video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty “cloud” computing services as we scale our original content production we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines including creative marketing legal finance licensing merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content further we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers as we grow our operations we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content our business may be adversely affected 

if we fail to maintain or in newer markets establish a positive reputation concerning our service including the content we offer we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members to the extent our content in particular our original programming is perceived as low quality offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted to the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior including being required to remove such content from our service our entire service could be banned andor become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations we could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business furthermore to the extent our response to government action or our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted with newer markets we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted 

changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs including social media sites to promote our service and content to existing and potential new members we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to engage members and attract new members may be adversely affected 

companies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us for example if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors we may no longer have access to their marketing channels we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously canceled their membership if we are unable to maintain or 

replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize marketing to promote our content and drive conversation about our content and service to the extent we promote our content or service inefficiently or ineffectively we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected devices including tvs digital video players television settop boxes and mobile devices we have agreements with various cable satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television settop boxes of these service providers some of whom may have investments in competing streaming content providers in many instances our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service if partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch for example through multiservice discovery interfaces our service may be adversely impacted we intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream tv series documentaries and feature films to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing regulatory business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted 

our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices or if we discontinue support for certain devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to payment processing risk 

our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards gift cards prepaid cards direct debit online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are increases in payment processing fees material changes in the payment ecosystem such as large reissuances of payment cards delays in receiving payments from payment processors changes to rules or regulations concerning payments loss of payment partners andor disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems partner systems or payment products including products we use to update payment information our revenue operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted in certain instances we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf if these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention in addition from time to time we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service if we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels card networks may impose fines our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements the termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business as our service and others like us gain traction in international markets governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services in particular those related to broadcast media and tax for example recent changes to european law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction 

we anticipate that several jurisdictions may over time impose greater financial and regulatory obligations on us in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries including across the european union in others the laws may be nascent or nonexistent furthermore favorable laws may change including for example in the united states where net neutrality regulations were repealed given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

risks related to intellectual property 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights including distribution rights to such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary as content providers develop their own streaming services they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content including popular series or movies if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected andor our costs could increase certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we see the cost of certain programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations “cmos” that hold certain rights to music andor other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain cmos and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with cmos or result in music publishers represented by certain cmos unilaterally withdrawing rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs additionally as the market for the digital distribution of content grows a broader role for cmos in the remuneration of authors performers and other rights holders could expose us to greater distribution expenses 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any copyrights patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties the value of our brand content and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the 

perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our website streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes our content and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service we use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content merchandising our products and marketing our service from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current website streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products we may also have to remove content from our service or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our content merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

risks related to information technology 

any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyberattacks could result in a loss or degradation of service unauthorized disclosure of data including member and corporate information or theft of intellectual property including digital content assets which could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from among other things earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks rogue employees power loss telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats including cyberattacks such as computer viruses denial of service attacks physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of personal information and other data confidential information or intellectual property additionally outside parties may attempt to induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data any attempt by hackers to obtain our data including member and corporate information or intellectual property including digital content assets disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems but the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access because of our prominence we andor third parties we use may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks and from time to time we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets however to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service systems or business there is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop implement and maintain these efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts 

to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation further a penetration of our systems or a thirdparty’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business regulatory litigation and reputation risk which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty provider in addition we utilize thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv series documentaries and feature films in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty “cloud” computing or other network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services “aws” provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service although if it was to do so it could harm our business 

if the technology we use in operating our business fails is unavailable or does not operate to expectations our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we utilize a combination of proprietary and thirdparty technology to operate our business this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices for example we have built and deployed our own contentdelivery network “cdn” to the extent internet service providers “isps” do not interconnect with our cdn or charge us to access their networks or if we experience difficulties in our cdn’s operation our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected likewise if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected we also utilize thirdparty technology to help market our service process payments and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business if our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software our ability to operate our service retain existing members and add new members may be impaired any harm to our members’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet if network operators block restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks our service and business could be negatively affected to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted the extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets 

risks related to privacy 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personal information and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize information supplied by our members which may include personal information and other data we currently face certain regulatory requirements regarding the manner in which we treat such information including but not limited to regulation eu 2016679 also known as the general data protection regulation or “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act ccpa any actual or perceived failure to comply with the gdpr the ccpa other data privacy laws or regulations or related contractual or other obligations or any perceived privacy rights violation could lead to investigations claims and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties damages for contract breach and other significant costs penalties and other liabilities as well as harm to our reputation and market position 

other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect transfer and use information and other data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose information and other data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information such as laws regarding data localization andor restrictions on data export failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information and other data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal information and other data regarding our members including names and billing information this information and data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations with respect to billing information such as credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data despite these measures we our payment processing services or other thirdparty services we use such as aws could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members we also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach including various state attorneys general one or more eu data protection authorities or other data protection authorities as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods additionally we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach we also maintain personal information and other data concerning our employees as well as personal information of others working on our productions should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and other data andor production personal information occur our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted 

risks related to liquidity 

the longterm and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

in connection with licensing streaming content we typically enter into multiyear commitments with studios and other content providers we also enter into multiyear commitments for content that we produce either directly or through third parties including elements associated with these productions such as noncancelable commitments under talent agreements the payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base “fixed cost” but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments to the extent estimable under accounting standards are included in the contractual obligations section of part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 7 commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be adversely impacted payment terms for certain content commitments such as content we directly produce will typically 

require more upfront cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content to the extent membership andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate if we license andor produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory or is unable to be shown in a territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities for several years prior to 2020 our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital the decision to obtain additional capital will depend on among other things our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution any large equity or equitylinked offering could also negatively impact our stock price 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations which could adversely affect our financial position 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations moreover we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations including additional streaming content obligations if the financial markets become difficult or costly to access our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted as of december 31 2020 we had the equivalent of 164 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding “notes” some of which is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 70 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet some of which is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition the amounts of which are significant for more information on our streaming content obligations including those not on our consolidated balance sheet see note 7 commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k our substantial indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations may 

• make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our notes and our other obligations 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general business purposes 

• increase our cost of borrowing 

• limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general business purposes 

• require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due 

• limit our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors and 

• increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 

our streaming obligations include large multiyear commitments as a result we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the nearterm this could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time which may negatively impact our stock price 

the interest rate of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement makes reference to an adjusted london interbank offered rate libo rate it is possible that beginning in 2022 the libo rate will be discontinued as a reference rate under our revolving credit agreement in the event of the discontinuance of the libo rate a mutually agreedupon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the libo rate in the event that an agreement cannot be reached on an appropriate benchmark rate the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be adversely impacted 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations 

our ability to make payments on our debt including our notes and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control for several years prior to 2020 our cash flows from operations were negative we may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our debt including the notes and other obligations including amounts due under our streaming content obligations 

if we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations if our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations when due if it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to international operations 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic political regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 

• the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences 

• difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations 

• political or social unrest and economic instability 

• compliance with laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws export controls and economic sanctions and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials 

• difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions including local ownership requirements for streaming content providers 

• regulatory requirements or government action against our service whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise that results in disruption or nonavailability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction 

• foreign intellectual property laws such as the eu copyright directive or changes to such laws which may be less favorable than us law and among other issues may impact the economics of creating or distributing content antipiracy efforts or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights 

• adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which will impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 

• profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds 

• differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods such as payment cards 

• new and different sources of competition 

• censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content leading to consumer disappointment brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service 

• low usage andor penetration of internetconnected consumer electronic devices 

• different and more stringent user protection data protection privacy and other laws including data localization andor restrictions on data export and local ownership requirements 

• availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion 

• differing and often more lenient laws and consumer understandingattitudes regarding the illegality of piracy 

• negative impacts from trade disputes and 

• implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and tv series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity including local content quotas investment obligations and levies to support local film funds for example the european union revised its audio visual media services directive in 2018 to require that european works comprise at least thirty 30 percent of media service providers’ catalogs and to require prominence of those works 

our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes 

tax laws are being reexamined and evaluated globally new laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions many us states countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

risks related to human resources 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our cochief executive officers reed hastings and ted sarandos members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highlyskilled business product development technical creative and other personnel if we experience high executive turnover are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel in instilling our culture in new employees or improving our culture as we grow our operations may be disrupted 

labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

our partners suppliers vendors and we employ the services of writers directors actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry both in the us and internationally expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us if expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production added costs or by reducing profit margins 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

• authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue up to 10000000 shares of undesignated preferred stock 

• provide for a classified board of directors 

• prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent 

• establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings and 

• prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

• variations in our operating results including our membership acquisition and retention revenues operating income net income net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 

• variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts investors and the financial community 

• announcements of developments affecting our business systems or expansion plans by us or others 

• competition including the introduction of new competitors their pricing strategies and services 

• market volatility in general 

• the level of demand for our stock including the amount of short interest in our stock 

• the impact of any future stock repurchase program we may adopt 

• the operating results of our competitors and 

• other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors 

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues operating margins net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock in addition the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods we base such estimates on historical experience and on various other 

assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances but actual results may differ from these estimates for example we estimate the content amortization pattern beginning with the month of first availability of any particular licensed or produced television series documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns if actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates the pattern andor period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization if we revise such estimates it could result in greater inperiod expenses which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price 

general risk factors 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us these matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content patent infringement claims tax litigation employment related litigation as well as consumer and securities class actions each of which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses result in content unavailability service disruptions and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position we also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities while the ultimate outcome of investigations inquiries information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict such matters can be expensive timeconsuming and distracting and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in among other things modification of our business practices reputational harm or costs and significant payments any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position

results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 24 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in our consolidated revenues was due to the 24 growth in average paying memberships and a 1 increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership the increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates paid net membership additions for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 31 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 as a result of the long term trend toward streaming on demand entertainment and due to the covid19 pandemic and resulting social restrictions and local government mandates of home confinement in certain jurisdictions 

the increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues and decreased marketing costs coupled with cost of revenues technology and development and general and administrative costs growing at a slower rate as compared to the 24 increase in revenues 

the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict see item 1a risk factors section set forth in this annual report on form 10k for additional details in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees our workforce has had and continues in most instances to spend a significant amount of time working from home international travel has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption as are the productions of our thirdparty content suppliers our other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development production and postproduction of content while we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic in an effort to contain covid19 or slow its spread governments around the world have also enacted various measures some of which have been subsequently rescinded modified or reinstated including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence and practice social distancing we anticipate that these actions and the global health crisis caused by covid19 including any resurgences will continue to negatively impact business activity across the globe we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state local or foreign authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers 

partners and stockholders it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers suppliers or vendors or on our financial results 

streaming revenues 

  

we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members we offer a variety of streaming membership plans the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan as of december 31 2020 pricing on our plans ranged from the us dollar equivalent of 2 to 24 per month we expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations 

the following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

united states and canada ucan 



europe middle east and africa emea

1 a paid membership also referred to as a paid subscription is defined as a membership that has the right to receive netflix service following signup and a method of payment being provided and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the company to new or rejoining members a membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period involuntary cancellations as a result of a failed method of payment become effective immediately memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of signup as determined by the company’s internal systems which utilize industry standard geolocation technology 

2 we believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership in order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prioryear period for the year ended december 31 2020 our revenues would have been approximately 596 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended december 31 2019 

cost of revenues 

amortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues expenses associated with the acquisition licensing and production of content such as payroll and related personnel expenses costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content overall deals with talent miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues we have built our own global content delivery network “open connect” to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet delivery expenses therefore include equipment costs related to open connect payroll and related personnel expenses and all thirdparty costs such as cloud computing costs associated with delivering content over the internet other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees including those we pay to our integrated payment partners as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members 



the increase in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to a 1591 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content including more exclusive and original programming expenses associated with the acquisition licensing and production of content increased 1101 million primarily due to expenses related to the covid19 pandemic and continued growth in our content production activities streaming delivery costs and other operations costs increased driven by our growing member base 

marketing 

marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners including consumer electronics ce manufacturers mvpds mobile operators and isps advertising expenses include 

promotional activities such as digital and television advertising marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support marketing activities 



the decrease in marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to a 432 million decrease in advertising expenses partially offset by increased payments to our marketing partners 

technology and development 

technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for all technology personnel as well as other costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings including testing maintaining and modifying our user interface our recommendations merchandising and streaming delivery technology and infrastructure technology and development expenses also include costs associated with computer hardware and software 

  



the increase in technology and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to a 254 million increase in personnelrelated costs including increases in compensation for existing employees and growth in average headcount to support the increase in our production activity and continued improvements in our streaming service 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for corporate personnel general and administrative expenses also include professional fees and other general corporate expenses 



the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily due to a 128 million increase in personnelrelated costs including increases in compensation for existing employees and growth in average headcount to support the increase in our production activity and continued improvements in our streaming service 

interest expense 

interest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding debt obligations including the amortization of debt issuance costs see note 6 debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for further detail on our debt obligations 

  



interest expense for the year ended december 31 2020 consisted primarily of 749 million of interest on our notes the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 is due to the increase in debt 

interest and other income expense 

interest and other income expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 



interest and other income expense decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses of 660 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to a gain of 7 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the foreign exchange loss in the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by the noncash 533 million loss from the remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies 

provision for income taxes 

as of december 31 2020 we had a california research and development rd credit carryforward of 250 million which can be carried forward indefinitely on june 29 2020 california enacted legislative changes that impose an annual cap of 5 million on the amount of business incentive tax credits we can utilize in california effective for tax years 2020 through 2022 as a result we evaluated our ability to realize the california rd credit and considered all available positive and negative evidence including operating results ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income and determined it is more likely than not that the pre2020 credits and a portion of the current year rd credit would not be realized in the twelve months ended december 31 2020 we recorded a valuation allowance of 250 million we will monitor our business strategies weighing positive and negative evidence in assessing the realization of this asset in the future and in the event there is a need to release the valuation allowance a tax benefit will be recorded 

the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 is primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the california rd credit partially offset by the recognition of excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation 

in 2020 the difference between our 14 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation and federal and california rd credits partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance on the california rd credit 

liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and restricted cash increased 3195 million in the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to cash provided by operations coupled with the issuance of debt 

debt net of debt issuance costs increased 1550 million primarily due to the issuance of debt in april 2020 coupled with the remeasurement of our eurodenominated notes the amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is 1264 million as of december 31 2020 no amounts had been borrowed under our 750 million revolving credit agreement see note 6 debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 

as our cash provided by operating activities improved in 2020 we anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

as our cash provided by operating activities grows and exceeds our minimum cash needs our future capital allocation may include stock repurchase programs the timing and magnitude of such programs will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans and operating performance 

our primary uses of cash include the acquisition licensing and production of content streaming delivery marketing programs and personnelrelated costs cash payment terms for nonoriginal content have historically been in line with the amortization period investments in original content and in particular content that we produce and own require more cash upfront relative to licensed content for example production costs are paid as the content is created well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized we expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content particularly in original content which will impact our liquidity we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations available funds and access to financing sources including our revolving credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like share repurchases free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow provided by used in operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense noncash remeasurement gainloss on our eurodenominated debt and other working capital differences working capital differences include deferred revenue excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation taxes and semiannual interest payments on our outstanding debt our receivables from members generally settle quickly 



while we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic as a result the timing of certain production payments has been and will continue to be delayed until productions can resume and may be shifted to future years net cash provided by operating activities increased 5314 million from the year ended december 31 2019 to 2427 million for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by a 4840 million or 24 increase in revenues coupled with a decrease in cash payments for content assets the payments for content assets decreased 2074 million from 14611 million to 12537 million or 14 as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of 1591 million from 9216 million to 10807 million or 17 in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion 

net cash used in investing activities increased 118 million primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment 

net cash provided by financing activities decreased 3268 million primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of 3431 million from 4433 million in the year ended december 31 2019 to 1002 million in the year ended december 31 2020 partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 163 million 

free cash flow was 840 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to 1730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and 308 million in other nonfavorable working capital differences partially offset by 533 million of noncash remeasurement loss on our eurodenominated debt 415 million of noncash stockbased compensation expenses and a 250 million noncash valuation allowance for deferred taxes due to recent legislation which imposed an annual cap on research and development credits 

free cash flow was 5141 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to 5394 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense 46 million noncash remeasurement gain on our eurodenominated debt and 106 million in other nonfavorable working capital differences partially offset by 405 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense 

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2020 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 

  



  

1 as of december 31 2020 content obligations were comprised of 44 billion included in current content liabilities and 26 billion of noncurrent content liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and 122 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition 

content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition licensing and production of content an obligation for the production of content includes noncancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments an obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity andor fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date traditional film output deals or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown are examples of these types of agreements the contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years however these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately 1 billion to 4 billion over the next three years with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above 

2 debt obligations include our notes consisting of principal and interest payments see note 6 debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for further details

4 other purchase obligations include all other noncancelable contractual obligations these contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloud computing costs as well as other miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods 

as of december 31 2020 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 140 million of which 38 million was classified in “other noncurrent liabilities” and 54 million as a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets at this time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

indemnifications

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

content 

we acquire license and produce content including original programming in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment the content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense payments for content including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities are classified within net cash provided by used in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

we recognize content assets licensed and produced as content assets net on the consolidated balance sheets for licensed content we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming for produced content we capitalize costs associated with the production including development cost direct costs and production overhead participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs 

based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns we amortize the content assets licensed and produced in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations over the shorter of each titles contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years beginning with the month of first availability the amortization is on an accelerated basis as we typically expect more upfront viewing for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts and film amortization is more accelerated than tv series amortization on average over 90 of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability we review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment 

our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level content assets licensed and produced are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost to date we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances if such changes are identified in the future these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value in addition unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent 

and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2020 the valuation allowance of 250 million was related to the california research and development credits that we do not expect to realize 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2020 our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 140 million of which 86 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2020 our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 

as of december 31 2020 we had 164 billion of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in sixteen tranches due between 2021 and 2030 refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest the fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates as discussed below 

foreign currency risk 

revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar account for 54 of the consolidated amount for the year ended december 31 2020 we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies which are primarily the euro the british pound the brazilian real the canadian dollar the mexican peso the australian dollar and the japanese yen 

accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in us dollars for the year ended december 31 2020 our revenues would have been approximately 596 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended december 31 2019 

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency in the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a 660 million foreign exchange loss primarily due to the noncash remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies 

in addition the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december 31 2020 was an increase of 36 million 

we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

risk factors 

tableend 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices effectively market our service as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing tv series and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships competitors include other entertainment video providers such as mvpds and streaming entertainment providers including those that provide pirated content as well as video gaming providers and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or service offerings or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members in addition many of our members rejoin our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base while we permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for noncommercial purposes if account sharing is abused our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted if we do not grow as expected given in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per membership revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of members cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members 

changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video including the potential rapid adoption of piracybased video offerings could adversely impact our business 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change through new and existing distribution channels consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market piracy in particular threatens to damage our business as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against virtually all content for free furthermore in light of the compelling consumer proposition piracy services are subject to rapid global growth traditional providers of entertainment video including broadcasters and cable network operators as well as internet based ecommerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings several of these competitors have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial marketing and other resources they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development technology infrastructure content acquisitions and marketing new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

in connection with licensing streaming content we typically enter into multiyear commitments with studios and other content providers we also enter into multiyear commitments for content that we produce either directly or through third parties including elements associated with these productions such as noncancelable commitments under talent agreements 

the payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base “fixed cost” but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments to the extent estimable under accounting standards are included in the contractual obligations section of part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 5 commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be adversely impacted payment terms for certain content commitments such as content we directly produce will typically require more upfront cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content to the extent membership andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate if we license andor produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory or is unable to be shown in a territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a producer and distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright and trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials we are devoting more resources toward the development production marketing and distribution of original programming including tv series and movies we believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations in particular in terms of costs viewing and popularity our business including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted as we expand our original programming we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we also take on risks associated with production such as completion and key talent risk negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions we contract with third parties related to the development production marketing and distribution of our original programming we may face potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these arrangements including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior to the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming andor license such rights to third parties we could become subject to product liability intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise we may decide to remove content from our service not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand or business 

to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service or if we become liable for content we acquire produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights including distribution rights to such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary as content providers develop their own streaming services they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content including popular series or movies if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected andor our costs could increase certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we see the cost of certain programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and 

renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations “cmos” that hold certain rights to music andor other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain cmos and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with cmos or result in music publishers represented by certain cmos unilaterally withdrawing rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs additionally as the market for the digital distribution of content grows a broader role for cmos in the remuneration of authors and performers could expose us to greater distribution expenses 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service ramping up our ability to produce original content as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the us as our international offering evolves we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and streaming video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty “cloud” computing services as we ramp up our original content production we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines including creative marketing legal finance licensing merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content further we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers as we grow our operations we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content our business may be adversely affected 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic political regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 



 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes 

tax laws are being reexamined and evaluated globally new laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain or in newer markets establish a positive reputation concerning our service including the content we offer we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members to the extent our content in particular our original programming is perceived as low quality offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted to the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior including being required to remove such content from our service our entire service could be banned andor become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations we could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business furthermore to the extent our response to government action or our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted with newer markets we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted 

changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs including social media sites to promote our service and content to existing and potential new members we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to engage members and attract new members may be adversely affected 

companies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us for example if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors we may no longer have access to their marketing channels we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously canceled their membership if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize marketing to promote our content drive conversation about our content and service and drive viewing by our members to the extent we promote our content inefficiently or ineffectively we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected screens including tvs digital video players television settop boxes and mobile devices we have agreements with various cable satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television settop boxes of these service providers some of whom may have investments in competing streaming content providers in many instances our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service if partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch for example through multiservice discovery interfaces our service may be adversely impacted we intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream tv series and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing regulatory business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted 

our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices or if we discontinue support for certain devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyberattacks could result in a loss or degradation of service unauthorized disclosure of data including member and corporate information or theft of intellectual property including digital content assets which could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from among other things earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks rogue employees power loss telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats including cyberattacks such as computer viruses denial of service attacks physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of personal information and other data confidential information or intellectual property additionally outside parties may attempt to induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data any attempt by hackers to obtain our data including member and corporate information or intellectual property including digital content assets disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems but the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access because of our prominence we andor third parties we use may be a particularly attractive target for 

such attacks and from time to time we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets however to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service systems or business there is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop implement and maintain these efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation further a penetration of our systems or a thirdparty’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business regulatory litigation and reputation risk which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty provider in addition we utilize thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv series and movies in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty “cloud” computing or other network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services “aws” provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service although if it was to do so it could harm our business 

if the technology we use in operating our business fails is unavailable or does not operate to expectations our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we utilize a combination of proprietary and thirdparty technology to operate our business this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices for example we have built and deployed our own contentdelivery network “cdn” to the extent internet service providers “isps” do not interconnect with our cdn or charge us to access their networks or if we experience difficulties in our cdn’s operation our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected likewise if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected we also utilize thirdparty technology to help market our service process payments and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business if our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software our ability to operate our service retain existing members and add new members may be impaired any harm to our members’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business as our service and others like us gain traction in international markets governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services in particular those related to broadcast media and tax for example recent changes to european law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction we anticipate that several jurisdictions may over time impose greater financial and regulatory obligations on us in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries including across the european union in others the laws may be nascent or nonexistent furthermore favorable laws may change including for example in the united states where net neutrality regulations were repealed given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet if network operators block restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks our service and business could be negatively affected to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted the extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personal information and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize information supplied by our members which may include personal information and other data we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information including but not limited to regulation eu 2016679 also known as the general data protection regulation or “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act ccpa any actual or perceived failure to comply with the gdpr the ccpa other data privacy laws or regulations or related contractual or other obligations or any perceived privacy rights violation could lead to investigations claims and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties damages for contract breach and other significant costs penalties and other liabilities as well as harm to our reputation and market position 

other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect transfer and use information and other data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose information and other data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information such as laws regarding data localization andor restrictions on data export failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information and other data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal information and other data regarding our members including names and billing information this information and data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations with respect to billing information such as credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data despite these measures we our payment processing services or other thirdparty services we use such as aws could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members we also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach including the eu lead data protection 

authority as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods additionally we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach we also maintain personal information and other data concerning our employees as well as personal information of others working on our productions should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and other data andor production personal information occur our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to payment processing risk 

our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards gift cards prepaid cards direct debit online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are increases in payment processing fees material changes in the payment ecosystem such as large reissuances of payment cards delays in receiving payments from payment processors changes to rules or regulations concerning payments loss of payment partners andor disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems partner systems or payment products including products we use to update payment information our revenue operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted in certain instances we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf if these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention in addition from time to time we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service if we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels card networks may impose fines our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements the termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any copyrights patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties the value of our brand content and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our website streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service we use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content merchandising our products and marketing our service from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not 

searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current website streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products we may also have to remove content from our service or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our content merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us these matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content patent infringement claims employment related litigation as well as consumer and securities class actions each of which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses result in content unavailability service disruptions and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position we also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities while the ultimate outcome of investigations inquiries information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict such matters can be expensive timeconsuming and distracting and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in among other things modification of our business practices reputational harm or costs and significant payments any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities our cash flows provided by our operating activities have been negative in each of the last five years primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available on our service we expect our cash flows from operations to continue to be negative for some time and anticipate seeking additional capital the decision to obtain additional capital will depend on among other things our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution any large equity or equitylinked offering could also negatively impact our stock price 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations which could adversely affect our financial position 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations moreover we expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and to incur other obligations including additional streaming content obligations if the financial markets become difficult or costly to access our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted as of december 31 2019  we had the equivalent of 149 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding “notes” some of which is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 77 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet some of which is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition the amounts of which are significant for more information on our streaming content obligations including those not on our consolidated balance sheet see note 5 commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k our substantial indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations may 



 our streaming obligations include large multiyear commitments as a result we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the nearterm this could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time which may negatively impact our stock price 

the interest rate of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement makes reference to an adjusted london interbank offered rate libo rate it is possible that beginning in 2022 the libo rate will be discontinued as a reference rate under our revolving credit agreement in the event of the discontinuance of the libo rate a mutually agreedupon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the libo rate in the event that an agreement cannot be reached on an appropriate benchmark rate the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be adversely impacted 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations 

our ability to make payments on our debt including our notes and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control in each of the last five years our cash flows from operating activities have been negative we may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our debt including the notes and other obligations including amounts due under our streaming content obligations 

if we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations if our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due if it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highlyskilled business product development technical creative and other personnel if we experience high executive turnover are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel in instilling our culture in new employees or improving our culture as we grow our operations may be disrupted 

labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

our partners suppliers vendors and we employ the services of writers directors actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry both in the us and internationally expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us if expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective 

bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production added costs or by reducing profit margins 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues operating margins net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock in addition the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods we base such estimates on historical experience and on various other 

assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances but actual results may differ from these estimates for example we estimate the amortization pattern beginning with the month of first availability of any particular licensed or produced television series or movie based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns if actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates the pattern andor period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization if we revise such estimates it could result in greater inperiod expenses which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price

results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 28 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase in our consolidated revenues was due to the 23 growth in average paying memberships and a 5 increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership the increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

the increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire license and produce content including more netflix originals as well as increased marketing expenses and headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service our international expansion and our growing content production activities 

streaming revenues 

  

we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members we offer a variety of streaming membership plans the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan as of december 31 2019  pricing on our plans ranged from the us dollar equivalent of 3 to 22 per month we expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations 

the following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017

1 we believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership in order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prioryear period for the year ended december 31 2019  our revenues would have been approximately 762 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended december 31 2018  

cost of revenues 

amortization of streaming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues expenses associated with the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content such as payroll and related personnel expenses costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content overall deals with talent miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues we have built our own global content delivery network “open connect” to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet streaming delivery expenses therefore include equipment costs related to open connect payroll and related personnel expenses and all thirdparty costs such as cloud computing costs associated with delivering streaming content over the internet other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees including those we pay to our integrated payment partners as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members 



the increase in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to a 1684 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 789 million primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content as well as increased payment processing fees driven by our growing member base

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2019 consists primarily of 614 million of interest on our notes the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 is due to the increase in longterm debt 

interest and other income expense 

interest and other income expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 



interest and other income expense for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 increased primarily due to a 30 million increase in interest income earned on cash balances coupled with foreign exchange gains the foreign exchange gain of 7 million in the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by the 46 million gain from the remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies of our european and us entities 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

  

in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we simplified our global corporate structure effective april 1 2019 the tax impacts of such simplifications were not material to the financial statements taken as a whole during the fourth quarter of 2019 the united states treasury issued final regulations with respect to certain aspects related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 additional guidance provided in these regulations resulted in a tax adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2019 we paid us federal taxes for the full year inclusive of this fourth quarter adjustment 

the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 is primarily due to the global corporate structure simplification lower benefit from the recognition of excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation and a lower benefit on a percentage basis from federal and california research and development rd credits the onetime transition tax benefit under staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 that provided a measurement period to address the us gaap impacts associated with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 is no longer applicable in 2019 

in 2019 the difference between our 9 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation federal and california rd credits and the international provisions from the us tax reform enacted in 2017 partially offset by state taxes foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  



cash cash equivalents and restricted cash increased 1232 million in the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to the issuance of debt partially offset by cash used in operations 

longterm debt net of debt issuance costs increased 4399 million due to longterm note issuances in 2019  the earliest maturity date for our outstanding longterm debt is february 2021 as of december 31 2019  no amounts had been borrowed under our 750 million revolving credit agreement see note 4 longterm debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements we anticipate continuing to finance our future capital needs in the debt market our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

our primary uses of cash include the acquisition licensing and production of content streaming delivery marketing programs and personnelrelated costs cash payment terms for nonoriginal content have historically been in line with the amortization period investments in original content and in particular content that we produce and own require more cash upfront relative to licensed content for example production costs are paid as the content is created well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized we expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content particularly in original content which will impact our liquidity and result in future net cash used in operating activities and negative free cash flows for many years we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations available funds and access to financing sources including our revolving credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by used in operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations including investments in global streaming content free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow used in operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense and other working capital differences working capital differences include deferred revenue excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation taxes and semiannual interest payments on our outstanding debt our receivables from members generally settle quickly 



net cash used in operating activities increased 207 million from the year ended december 31 2018 to 2887 million for the year ended december 31 2019  the increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments partially offset by a 4362 million or 28 increase in revenues the payments for streaming content assets increased 2567 million  from 12044 million to 14611 million  or 21  as compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of 1684 million  from 7532 million to 9216 million  or 22  in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service our international expansion and increased content production activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased 48 million  primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment 

net cash provided by financing activities increased 457 million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of 507 million from 3926 million in the year ended december 31 2018 to 4433 million in the year ended december 31 2019  in addition we had a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 52 million  

free cash flow was 5141 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to 5394 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and 152 million in other nonfavorable working capital differences partially offset by 405 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense 

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2019  timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2019  

  



  



streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content an obligation for the production of content includes noncancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments an obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity andor fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date traditional film output deals or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown are examples of these types of agreements the contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years however these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately 1 billion to 4 billion over the next three years with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above 

  

 

 

 

as of december 31 2019  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 67 million which was classified in “other noncurrent liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets at this time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

indemnifications 

the information set forth under note 6 guarantees  indemnification obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

streaming content 

we acquire license and produce content including original programing in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of entertainment the content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense payments for content including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities are classified within net cash used in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

we recognize content assets licensed and produced as noncurrent content assets net on the consolidated balance sheet for licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming for productions we capitalize costs associated with the production including development cost direct costs and production overhead participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs 

based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns we amortize the content assets licensed and produced in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations over the shorter of each titles contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years beginning with the month of first availability the amortization is on an accelerated basis as we typically expect more upfront viewing for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts and film amortization is more accelerated than tv series amortization on average over 90 of a licensed or produced streaming content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability we review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment 

our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level content assets licensed and produced are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost to date we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances if such changes are identified in the future these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value in addition unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized at december 31 2019 the valuation allowance of 135 million was primarily related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2019  our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 67 million of which 57 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates

historical segment information 

historically we reported contribution profit loss for three segments domestic streaming international streaming and domestic dvd which was reflective of how our chief operating decision maker codm reviewed financial information for the purposes of making operating decisions assessing financial performance and allocating resources contribution profit loss is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment because we increasingly obtain multiterritory or global rights for streaming content contribution profit loss on a regional basis is no longer a meaningful metric reviewed by the codm or used in the allocation of resources 

effective in the fourth quarter of 2019 we operate as a single operating segment our codm is our chief executive officer who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions assessing financial performance and allocating resources 

as the transition to one segment occurred during 2019 we are providing supplemental proforma information reflecting our historic segment reporting as if it had remained in place for the full year ended december 31 2019 as follows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2019  our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 

as of december 31 2019  we had 149 billion of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2021 and 2030 refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest the fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates as discussed below 

foreign currency risk 

revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar account for 50 of the consolidated amount for the year ended december 31 2019  we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies which are primarily the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the japanese yen the mexican peso and the brazilian real 

accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in us dollars for the year ended december 31 2019  

our revenues would have been approximately 762 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended december 31 2018  

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency in the year ended december 31 2019  we recognized a 7 million foreign exchange gain due to the remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our european and us entities 

exchange rate changes had an immaterial impact on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december 31 2019  

we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

risk factors 

tableend 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing tv series and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships competitors include other entertainment video providers such as mvpds internetbased movie and tv content providers including those that provide pirated content and dvd retailers if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or service offerings or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members in addition many of our members rejoin our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base if we do not grow as expected given in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per membership revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of members cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members 

changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video including the potential rapid adoption of piracybased video offerings could adversely impact our business 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change through new and existing distribution channels consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market piracy in particular threatens to damage our business as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against virtually all content for free furthermore in light of the compelling consumer proposition piracy services are subject to rapid global growth traditional providers of entertainment video including broadcasters and cable network operators as well as internet based ecommerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internetbased video offerings several of these competitors have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial marketing and other resources they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development technology infrastructure content acquisitions and marketing new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

in connection with licensing streaming content we typically enter into multiyear commitments with studios and other content providers we also enter into multiyear commitments for content that we produce either directly or through third parties including elements associated with these productions such as noncancelable commitments under talent agreements the payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base “fixed cost” but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments to the extent estimable under accounting standards are included in the contractual obligations section of part ii 

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 5 commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be adversely impacted payment terms for certain content commitments such as content we directly produce will typically require more upfront cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content to the extent membership andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate if we license andor produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory or is unable to be shown in a territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a producer and distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright and trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials we are devoting more resources toward the development production marketing and distribution of original programming including tv series and movies we believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations in particular in terms of costs viewing and popularity our business including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted as we expand our original programming we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we also take on risks associated with production such as completion and key talent risk negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions we contract with third parties related to the development production marketing and distribution of our original programming we may face potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these arrangements including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior to the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming andor license such rights to third parties we could become subject to product liability intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise we may decide to remove content from our service not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand or business 

to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service or if we become liable for content we acquire produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary as content providers develop their own streaming services they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content including popular series or movies if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected andor our costs could increase certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we may see the cost of programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations “cmos” that hold certain 

rights to music andor other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain cmos and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with cmos or result in music publishers represented by certain cmos unilaterally withdrawing rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs additionally as the market for the digital distribution of content grows a broader role for cmos in the remuneration of authors and performers could expose us to greater distribution expenses 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service ramping up our ability to produce original content as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the us as our international offering evolves we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and internet video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty “cloud” computing services as we ramp up our original content production we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines including creative marketing legal finance licensing merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content our business may be adversely affected 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic political regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 



 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain or in newer markets establish a positive reputation concerning our service including the content we offer we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members to the extent our content in particular our original programming is perceived as low quality offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted to the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior including being required to remove such content from our service our entire service could be banned andor become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted with newer markets we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted 

changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs including social media sites to promote our service to potential new members we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected 

companies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us for example if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors we may no longer have access to their marketing channels we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize marketing to promote our content and drive viewing by our members to the extent we promote our content inefficiently or ineffectively we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected screens including tvs digital video players television settop boxes and mobile devices we have agreements with various cable satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television settop boxes of these service providers in many instances our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service we intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream tv series and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing regulatory business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted 

our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyberattacks could result in a loss or degradation of service unauthorized disclosure of data including member and corporate information or theft of intellectual property including digital content assets which could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks power loss telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats including cyberattacks both from statesponsored and individual activity such as computer viruses denial of service attacks physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data confidential information or intellectual property additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data any attempt by hackers to obtain our data including member and corporate information or intellectual property including digital content assets disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems but techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access because of our prominence we andor third parties we use may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks and from time to time we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets however to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service or systems there is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop implement and maintain these efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation further a penetration of our systems or a thirdparty’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business regulatory litigation and reputation risk which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv series and movies in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty web hosting “cloud” computing or other network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services “aws” provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service although if it was to do so it could harm our business 

if the technology we use in operating our business fails is unavailable or does not operate to expectations our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we utilize a combination of proprietary and thirdparty technology to operate our business this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices for example we have built and deployed our own contentdelivery network “cdn” to the extent internet service providers “isps” do not interconnect with our cdn or if we experience difficulties in its operation our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected likewise if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected we also utilize thirdparty technology to help market our service process payments and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business if our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software our ability to operate our service retain existing members and add new members may be impaired any harm to our members’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business as our service and others like us gain traction in international markets governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services in particular those related to broadcast media and tax for example recent changes to european law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries including across the european union in others the laws may be nascent or nonexistent furthermore favorable laws may change including for example in the united states where net neutrality regulations were repealed given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet if network operators block restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks our service and business could be negatively affected to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted the extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize data supplied by our members we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information including but not limited to regulation eu 2016679 also known as the general data protection regulation or “gdpr” other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect transfer and use data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information such as laws regarding data localization andor restrictions on data export failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our members including names and billing data this data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data despite these measures we our payment processing services or other thirdparty services we use such as aws could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members we also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach including the eu lead data protection authority as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods additionally we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach we also maintain employment and personal information concerning our employees as well as personal information of others working on our productions should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ data occur our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to payment processing risk 

our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards gift cards prepaid cards direct debit online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are increases in payment processing fees material changes in the payment ecosystem such as large reissuances of payment cards delays in receiving payments from payment processors changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing loss of payment partners andor disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems or payment products including products we use to update payment information our revenue operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted in certain instances we 

leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf if these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention in addition from time to time we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate at acceptable levels card networks may impose fines and our card approval rate may be impacted the termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any copyrights patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties the value of our brand content and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our website streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our our service we use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content merchandising our products and marketing our service from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current website streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products we may also have to remove content from our service or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our content merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us these matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content patent infringement claims employment related litigation as well as consumer and securities class actions each of which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses result in content unavailability service disruptions and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position we 

also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities while the ultimate outcome of investigations inquiries information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict such matters can be expensive timeconsuming and distracting and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in among other things modification of our business practices reputational harm or costs and significant payments any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities our cash flows provided by our operating activities have been negative in each of the last four years primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available on our service to the extent our cash flows from operations continue to be negative we anticipate seeking additional capital the decision to obtain additional capital will depend on among other things our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution any large equity or equitylinked offering could also negatively impact our stock price 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations which could adversely affect our financial position 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations moreover we expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and to incur other obligations including additional streaming content obligations as of december 31 2018  we had 104 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding “notes” in addition we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a 500 million  unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 84 billion  of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition the amounts of which are significant for more information on our streaming content obligations including those not on our consolidated balance sheet see note 5 commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k our substantial indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations may 

 our streaming obligations include large multiyear commitments as a result we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the nearterm this could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time which may negatively impact our stock price 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations 

our ability to make payments on our debt including our notes and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business 

and other factors beyond our control in each of the last four years our cash flows from operating activities have been negative we may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our debt including the notes and other obligations including amounts due under our streaming content obligations 

if we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations if our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due if it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highlyskilled business product development technical and other personnel we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel which may be disruptive to our operations 

labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

our partners suppliers vendors and we employ the services of writers directors actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry both in the us and internationally if expiring collective bargaining agreements can not be renewed then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues operating margins net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock in addition the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods we base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances but actual results may differ from these estimates for example we estimate the amortization pattern beginning with the month of first availability of any particular licensed or produced television series or movie based upon factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns if we revise such estimates it could result in greater inperiod expenses which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 35  including an increase of 24  and 53  in revenues in the domestic streaming and international streaming segments respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  international revenues accounted for 50  of total streaming revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to 45  of total streaming revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in the average number of streaming paid memberships globally the majority of which was growth in our international memberships average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 55  of total average streaming paid memberships as of december 31 2018  as compared to 49  of total average streaming paid memberships as of december 31 2017  in addition average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership increased primarily due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans the growth in paid net membership additions has been less volatile when compared to growth in total net membership additions as a result of free trial variability we therefore believe paid memberships is a more reliable indicator of revenue growth 

the increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire license and produce content including more netflix originals as well as increased marketing expenses and headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service our international expansion and our growing content production activities 

we offer three main types of streaming membership plans our basic plan includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time our standard plan is our most popular streaming plan and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently our premium plan includes access to high definition and ultrahigh definition quality content on four screens concurrently as of december 31 2018  pricing on our plans ranged in the us from 799 to 1399 per month and internationally from the us dollar equivalent of approximately 3  to 20  per month we expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may increase and we may occasionally test other plan and price variations 

the following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations 

 



expenses associated with the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content such as payroll and related personnel expenses costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content overall deals with talent miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues we have built our own global content delivery network open connect to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet streaming delivery expenses therefore include equipment costs related to open connect payroll and related personnel expenses and all thirdparty costs such as cloud computing costs associated with delivering streaming content over the internet other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees including those we pay to our integrated payment partners as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members 

 

segment results 

domestic streaming segment 



year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017   

in the domestic streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members in the united states the 24  increase in our domestic streaming revenues was primarily due to the 11  growth in the average number of paid memberships as well as a 12  increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from our price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans our standard plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new memberships 

 the increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a 358 million  increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 210 million  primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content as well as increased payment processing fees driven by our growing member base

the increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 976 million  increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 440 million  primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content coupled with increases in payment processing fees and streaming delivery expenses which were driven by our growing member base

the increase in our international revenues was due to the 43  growth in the average number of paid international memberships and an 11 increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership the increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix coupled with favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we estimate that international revenues would have been approximately 22 million  lower in the year ended december 31 2017  if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2016  

the increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 990 million  increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 327 million  primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations 

international marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased advertising and public relations as well as increased payments to our partners 

domestic dvd segment 



in the domestic dvd segment we derive revenues from our dvdbymail membership services we offer various dvdbymail plans that differ by the number of dvds that a member may have out at any given point and access to high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds cost of revenues in the domestic dvd segment consist primarily of delivery expenses such as packaging and postage costs content expenses and other expenses associated with our dvd processing and customer service centers the number of memberships to our dvdbymail offering is declining and we anticipate that this decline will continue

year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017   

interest and other income expense increased primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses the foreign exchange loss of 1 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  was primarily driven by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies of our european and us entities mostly offset by the 74 million  gain from remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros

interest and other income expense decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses in the year ended december 31 2017  the foreign exchange loss of 128 million  was primarily driven by the 141 million  loss from remeasurement of our €1300 million  senior notes partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than functional currencies of our european and us entities 

provision for income taxes 

year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017   

the increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to lower benefit on a percentage basis from the recognition of excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation as well as additional expense related to foreign taxes nondeductible expenses and the international provisions from the us tax reform enacted in december 2017 in 2018 the difference between our 1  effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21  was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation federal and california research and development credits “rd” and updated adjustments related to us tax reform as a result of the us federal tax return filing partially offset by state taxes foreign taxes nondeductible expenses and the international provisions from the us tax reform enacted in december 2017 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “act” was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35  to 21  effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 in accordance with the act we recorded 79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 the period in which the legislation was enacted the total expense included 32 million related to the transition tax and 47 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities additionally staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 was issued to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the act december 22 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of sab 118 as such we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the act currently available which resulted in an additional sab 118 tax benefit of 34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of 72 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the total tax provision benefit included 45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a 27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities 

year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016   

at the beginning of 2017 we underwent a corporate restructuring that better aligns our corporate structure with how our business operates as a result of this restructuring and our increasing international income there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the us tax rate 

the decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to the adoption of asu 201609 and an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate in 2017 the difference between our 15 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 244 million primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate and federal and california research and development credits “rd” partially offset by state taxes and nondeductible expenses as well as the provisional impact of changes to tax law 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “act” was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 we have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded 79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 the period in which the legislation was enacted the provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was 47 million the provisional amount related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was 32 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of 485 million we also recorded a 67 million benefit related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a foreign tax credit we have determined there is sufficient foreign source income projected to utilize these credits 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



        cash cash equivalents and restricted cash increased   989 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to the issuance of debt partially offset by cash used in operations 

longterm debt net of debt issuance costs increased   3861 million  due to longterm note issuances of 1900 million in april 2018 and 800 million and €1100 million in october 2018 the earliest maturity date for our outstanding longterm debt is february 2021 as of december 31 2018  no amounts had been borrowed under our 500 million revolving credit facility see note 4 longterm debt  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements we anticipate continuing to finance our future capital needs in the debt market as we continue to believe that our aftertax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

our primary uses of cash include the acquisition licensing and production of content streaming delivery marketing programs and personnelrelated costs cash payment terms for nonoriginal content have historically been in line with the amortization period investments in original content and in particular content that we produce and own require more cash upfront relative to licensed content for example production costs are paid as the content is created well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized we expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content particularly in original content which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations available funds and access to financing sources including our revolving credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by used in operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations including investments in global streaming content free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow used in operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense and other working capital differences working capital differences include deferred revenue taxes and semiannual interest payments on our outstanding debt our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow 



year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017   

net cash used in operating activities increased 895 million  to 2680 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  the increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments partially offset by a 4102 million  or 35  increase in revenues the payments for streaming content assets increased 3138 million  from 8906 million  to 12044 million  or 35  as compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of 1334 million  from 6198 million  to 7532 million  or 22  in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service our international expansion and increased content production activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased 373 million  primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments net of purchases of 268 million in july 2017 the company sold all shortterm investments in addition the cash used to purchase other assets increased 120 million primarily driven by the acquisition of intangible assets in the year ended december 31 2018  

net cash provided by financing activities increased 972 million  due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of 938 million  from 2988 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  to 3926 million  in the year ended december 31 2018  in addition we had an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 36 million  

nongaap free cash flow was 4231 million  lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to 4512 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and 40 million in other nonfavorable working capital differences partially offset by 321 million  of noncash stockbased compensation expense 

year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016   

net cash used in operating activities increased 312 million  to 1786 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  the increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments partially offset by a 2862 million  or 32  increase in revenues the payments for streaming content assets increased 2025 million  from 6881 million  to 8906 million  or 29  as compared to an increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of 1409 million  from 4788 million  to 6198 million  or 29 in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses primarily related to increased headcount costs to support our continued improvements in our streaming service our international expansion and increased content production activities the increased use of cash was partially offset by a 2862 million  or 32  increase in revenues 

net cash provided by investing activities decreased   15 million  primarily due to a 66 million  increase in the purchases of property and equipment largely due to the expansion of our los gatos california headquarters as well as our new office space in los angeles california this increase in cash used was partially offset by an increase of 33 million  in the proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases due to the sale of our shortterm investments in july 2017 as well as a decline in dvd purchases of 24 million 

net cash provided by financing activities increased   1985 million  due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of 1999 million  from 989 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  to 2988 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  

nongaap free cash flow was 2579 million  lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to 2708 million  of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and 53 million  of unfavorable other working capital differences partially offset by 182 million  of noncash stockbased compensation expense 

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2018  timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018  

  



  

 streaming content obligations increased 16 billion  from 177 billion  as of december 31 2017  to 193 billion  as of december 31 2018  primarily due to multiyear commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming 

streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content an obligation for the production of content includes noncancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments an obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity andor fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date traditional film output deals or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown are examples of these types of agreements the contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years however these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately 2 billion to 5 billion  over the next three years with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above 

  

 



as of december 31 2017  to 1708 million  as of december 31 2018  due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions 

 

as of december 31 2018  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 48 million  which was classified in “other noncurrent liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets at this time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

indemnifications 

the information set forth under note 6   guarantees  indemnification obligations  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

         the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

streaming content 

we acquire license and produce content including original programing in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of tv series and films the content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense payments for content including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities are classified within net cash used in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

for licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming the portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “current content assets net” and the remaining portion as “noncurrent content assets net” on the consolidated balance sheets 

for productions we capitalize costs associated with the production including development cost direct costs and production overhead we include these amounts in noncurrent content assets net on the consolidated balance sheets participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs 

based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns we amortize the content assets licensed and produced in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations over the shorter of each titles contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years beginning with the month of first availability the amortization is on an accelerated basis as we typically expect more upfront viewing for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts and film amortization is more accelerated than tv series amortization we review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment 

our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level therefore content assets both licensed and produced are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content asset to date we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances if such changes are identified in the future these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost net realizable value or fair value in addition unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized at december 31 2018 the valuation allowance of 125 million was primarily related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50  likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2018  our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 48 million  of which 44 million  if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “act” was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35  to 21  effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 in accordance with the act we recorded 79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 the period in which the legislation was enacted the total expense included 32 million related to the transition tax and 47 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities additionally staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 was issued to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the act december 22 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of sab 118 as such we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the act currently available which resulted in an additional sab 118 tax benefit of 34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of 72 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the total tax provision benefit included 45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a 27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations in july 2017 we sold all shortterm investments 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2018  our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 

as of december 31 2018  we had 104 billion  of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in ten tranches due between 2021 and 2029 refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest the fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates as discussed below 

foreign currency risk 

international revenues and cost of revenues account for 49  and 58  respectively of consolidated amounts for the year ended december 31 2018  the majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies which are primarily the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the japanese yen the mexican peso and the brazilian real 

accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit loss of our international streaming segment as expressed in us dollars for the year ended december 31 2018  we believe our international revenues would have been approximately 94 million   higher  had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2017  

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency in the year ended december 31 2018  we recognized a 1 million  foreign exchange loss due to the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our european and us entities mostly offset by the remeasurement of our senior notes denominated in euros 

in addition the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december 31 2018  was a decrease of 40 million  

we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change we compete against other entertainment video providers such as multichannel video programming distributors mvpds internetbased content providers including those that provide pirated content video gaming providers and dvd retailers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time we also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects

risk factors 

tableend 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships competitors include other entertainment video providers such as mvpds internetbased movie and tv content providers including those that provide pirated content and dvd retailers if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or service offerings or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members in addition many of our members rejoin our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base if we do not grow as expected given in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per membership revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of members cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members 

changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video including the potential rapid adoption of piracybased video offerings could adversely impact our business 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change through new and existing distribution channels consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market piracy in particular threatens to damage our business as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against virtually all content for free furthermore in light of the compelling consumer proposition piracy services are subject to rapid global growth traditional providers of entertainment video including broadcasters and cable network operators as well as internet based ecommerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internetbased video offerings several of these competitors have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition and significant financial marketing and other resources they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development technology infrastructure content acquisitions and marketing new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

in connection with licensing streaming content we typically enter into multiyear commitments with studios and other content providers we also enter into multiyear commitments for content that we produce either directly or through third parties including elements associated with these production such as noncancelable commitments under talent agreements the payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base “fixed cost” but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments to the extent estimable under accounting standards are included in the contractual obligations section of part ii 

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 5 commitments and contingencies  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be adversely impacted payment terms for certain content commitments such as content we directly produce will typically require more upfront cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content to the extent membership andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate if we license andor produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory or is unable to be shown in a territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a producer and distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright and trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials we are devoting more resources toward the development production marketing and distribution of original programming including tv series and movies we believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations in particular in terms of costs viewing and popularity our business including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted as we expand our original programming we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we also take on risks associated with production such as completion and key talent risk negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions to the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming andor license such rights to third parties we could become subject to product liability intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise we may decide to remove content from our service not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand 

to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service or if we become liable for content we acquire produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected andor our costs could increase certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we may see the cost of programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music and certain authors performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations “cmos” that hold certain rights to music andor other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach 

mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain cmos and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with cmos or result in music publishers represented by certain cmos unilaterally withdrawing rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service ramping up our ability to produce original content as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the us as our international offering evolves we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and internet video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty “cloud” computing services as we ramp up our original content production we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines including creative marketing legal finance licensing merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content our business may be adversely affected 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 



 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain or in newer markets establish a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service including the content we offer we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we believe that a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video to the extent our content in particular our original programming is perceived as low quality offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted to the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior including being required to remove such content from our service our entire service could be banned andor become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted with newer markets we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted 

changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs including social media sites to promote our service to potential new members we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected 

companies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us for example if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors we may no longer have access to their marketing channels we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize marketing to promote our content and drive viewing by our members to the extent we promote our content inefficiently or ineffectively we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected screens including tvs digital video players television settop boxes and mobile devices we have agreements with various cable satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television settop boxes of these service providers in many instances our agreements also including provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service we intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing regulatory business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted 

our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyberattacks could result in a loss or degradation of service unauthorized disclosure of data including member and corporate information or theft of intellectual property including digital content assets which could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks power loss telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks including cyberattacks both from statesponsored and individual activity such as computer viruses denial of service attacks physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data or intellectual property any attempt by hackers to obtain our data including member and corporate information or intellectual property including digital content assets disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems from time to time we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets however to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service or systems there is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty web hosting “cloud” computing or other network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services “aws” provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

if the technology we use in operating our business fails is unavailable or does not operate to expectations our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we utilize a combination of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices for example we have built and deployed our own contentdelivery network “cdn” to the extent internet service providers “isps” do not interconnect with our cdn or if we experience difficulties in its operation our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected likewise if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected we also utilize third party technology to help market our service process payments and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software our ability to operate our service retain existing members and add new members may be impaired any harm to our members personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business as our service and others like us gain traction in international markets governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services in particular those related to broadcast media and tax in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries including across the european union in others the laws may be nascent or nonexistent furthermore favorable laws may change including for example in the united states where net neutrality regulations were recently repealed given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet if network operators block restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks our service and business could be negatively affected to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted the extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differ across markets 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize data supplied by our members we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect transfer and use data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information such as laws regarding data localization andor restrictions on data export failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our members including names and billing data this data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members data despite these measures we our payment processing services or other third party services we use such as aws could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members additionally we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach we also maintain employment and personal information concerning our employees including those on our own productions should an unauthorized intrusion into our members or employees data occur our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to payment processing risk 

our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards gift cards direct debit and online wallets we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems increases in payment processing fees material changes in the payment ecosystem such as large reissuances of payment cards delays in receiving payments from payment processors andor changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing our revenue operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted in certain instances we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf if these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf we would have to find alternative methods of collecting payments which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention in addition from time to time we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any copyrights patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products we may also have to remove content from our service as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our content merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us these matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content patent infringements as well as consumer and securities class actions each of which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses result in content unavailability service disruptions and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities our cash flows provided by our operating activities have been negative in each of the last three years primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available on our service to the extent our cash flows from 

operations continue to be negative we anticipate seeking additional capital the decision to obtain additional capital will depend on among other things our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution any large equity or equitylinked offering could also negatively impact our stock price 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations which could adversely affect our financial position 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations moreover we expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and to incur other obligations including additional streaming content obligations as of december 31 2017  we had 65 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding “notes” in addition we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a 5000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 75 billion  of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition the amounts of which are significant for more information on our streaming content obligations including those not on our consolidated balance sheet see note 5 commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k our substantial indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations may 

 

our streaming obligations include large multiyear commitments as a result we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the nearterm this could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time which may negatively impact our stock price 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations 

our ability to make payments on our debt including our notes and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control in each of the last three years our cash flows from operating activities have been negative we may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our debt including the notes and other obligations including amounts due under our streaming content obligations 

if we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations if our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such 

alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due if it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highlyskilled business product development technical and other personnel we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel which may be disruptive to our operations 

if our domestic dvd segment declines faster than anticipated our business could be adversely affected 

the number of memberships to our dvdbymail offering is declining and we anticipate that this decline will continue we believe however that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund growth or our streaming service to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvdbymail business is greater than we anticipate our business could be adversely affected we do not anticipate increasing resources to our dvd operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved to the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our dvdbymail service members satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in dvdbymail member cancellations which could adversely impact our business 

if the us postal service were to increase postal delivery rates or implement other changes to improve its financial position such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our domestic dvd segments contribution profit could be adversely affected 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 



 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues operating margins net income and number of total and paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock in addition the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods we base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances but actual results may differ from these estimates for example we estimate the period of use beginning with the month of first availability of any particular licensed or produced television series or movie based upon factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns in order to amortize these content assets if we revise such estimates it could reduce the amortization period or result in impairment charges for the relevant content assets resulting in greater inperiod expenses which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview and results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  increased 32  including an increase of 21  and 58  in revenues in the domestic streaming and international streaming segments respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  international revenues as of the end of december 31 2017 accounted for 44  of consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 36  of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in the average number of paid streaming memberships globally the majority of which was growth in our international memberships average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 49  of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2017  as compared to 43  of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2016  the impact from membership growth was coupled with an increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from price changes and plan mix 

the increase in operating income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire license and produce content including more netflix originals this increase in content expenses includes a 391 million expense related to unreleased content that we have abandoned headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service our international expansion and increased content production activities also increased the increase in net income was comprised of an increase in operating income and an increase in the tax benefit primarily due to the adoption of asu 201609 in the first quarter of 2017 partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily due to the higher principal of notes outstanding and an increase in foreign exchange losses primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated senior notes 

we offer three types of streaming membership plans our basic plan includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time our standard plan is our most popular streaming plan and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently our premium plan includes access to high definition and ultrahigh definition quality content on four screens concurrently as of december 31 2017  pricing on our plans ranged in the us from 799 to 1399 per month and internationally from the us dollar equivalent of approximately 4  to 20  per month we expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may increase 

the following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations 

 



as cloud computing costs associated with delivering streaming content over the internet other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees including those we pay to our integrated payment partners as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members

domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending as well as increased payments to our partners in 2018 we expect marketing spending growth to outpace revenue growth 

our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 37  for the year ended december 31 2017  which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 36  for the year ended december 31 2016  due to growth in paid memberships and revenue which continued to outpace content spending

international streaming segment 



year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016   

in the international streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the united states we launched our streaming service in canada in september 2010 and have expanded our services internationally as shown below 

the increase  in our international revenues was due to the 43  growth in the average number of paid international memberships and an 11 increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership the increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix coupled with favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we estimate that international revenues would have been approximately 219 million  lower in the year ended december 31 2017  if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2016  if 

foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate more than expected revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations 

the increase  in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 9903 million  increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 2362 million  primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations 

international marketing expenses increased  mainly due to increased advertising and public relations as well as increased payments to our partners 

international contribution profit increased   5351 million  year over year as profit growth in our more mature markets offset investments in newer markets 

year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015   

the increase in our international revenues was due to the 57  growth in the average number of paid international memberships and a 4 increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership the increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix offset partially by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we estimate that international revenues would have been approximately 1740 million  higher in the year ended december 31 2016  if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2015  if foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate more than expected revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations 

the increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 9985 million  increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 1325 million  primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate 

fluctuations 

international marketing expenses increased mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months 

international contribution losses decreased 249 million year over year due to growth in paid memberships and revenue which outpaced the growth in marketing spending

in the domestic dvd segment we derive revenues from our dvdbymail membership services the price per plan for dvdbymail varies from 499 to 1499  per month according to the plan chosen by the member dvdbymail plans differ by the number of dvds that a member may have out at any given point members electing access to high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds pay a surcharge ranging from 2 to 3  per month for our most popular plans cost of revenues in the domestic dvd segment consist primarily of delivery expenses such as packaging and postage costs content expenses and other expenses associated with our dvd processing and customer service centers the number of memberships to our dvdbymail offering is declining and we anticipate that this decline will continue 

our domestic dvd segment had a contribution margin of 55  for the year ended december 31 2017  up from 52  for the year ended december 31 2016  due to the decrease in dvd usage by paying members and decreased dvd content expenses

interest and other income expense decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses in the year ended december 31 2017  the foreign exchange loss of 1279 million  was primarily driven by the 1408 million  loss from remeasurement of our €1300 million  senior notes partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than functional currencies of our european and us entities 

year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015   

interest and other income expense increased primarily due to foreign exchange in the year ended december 31 2016  the foreign exchange gain of 228 million  was primarily driven by the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies 

provision for income taxes 

year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016   

at the beginning of 2017 we underwent a corporate restructuring that better aligns our corporate structure with how our business operates as a result of this restructuring and our increasing international income there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the us tax rate 

the decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to the adoption of asu 201609 and an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate in 2017 the difference between our 15  effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35  was 2435 million  primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate and federal and california research and development credits “rd” partially offset by state taxes and nondeductible expenses as well as the provisional impact of changes to tax law 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “act” was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35  to 21  effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017  the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 we have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded 791 million  as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017  the period in which the legislation was enacted the provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was 469 million  the provisional amount related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was 322 million  based on cumulative foreign earnings of 4849 million  we also recorded a 665 million  benefit related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a foreign tax credit we have determined there is sufficient foreign source income projected to utilize these credits 

year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015   

the increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to a 134 million  release of tax reserves in 2015 and an increase in foreign taxes in 2016 the difference between our 28  effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35  was 173 million  primarily due to the 2016 federal and california rd credits partially offset by state income taxes foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



        cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased   10890 million  in the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to cash received from the issuance of debt partially offset by an increase in cash used in operations as of december 31 2017  cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to 6113 million  the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 included a onetime transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings and accordingly we recorded tax expense of 322 million  related to the transition tax on the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of all our foreign earnings as of december 31 2017  see note 9 income taxes  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for additional information on income taxes 

longterm debt net of debt issuance costs increased 31351 million  due to longterm note issuances of €13000 million in may 2017 and 16000 million in october 2017 the earliest maturity date for our outstanding longterm debt is february 2021 in july 2017 we entered into a 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility “revolving credit agreement” with an uncommitted incremental facility to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional 2500 million subject to certain terms and conditions as of december 31 2017  no amounts had been borrowed under the revolving credit agreement see note 4 longterm debt  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for additional information about longterm debt we anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market as we believe our aftertax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity our ability to obtain any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

our primary uses of cash include the acquisition licensing and production of content streaming delivery marketing programs and personnelrelated costs for licensed content cash payment terms have historically been in line with the amortization period investments in original content and in particular content that we produce and own require more cash upfront relative to licensed content for example production costs are paid as the content is created well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized we expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content particularly in original content which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations available funds and access to financing sources including our revolving credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by used in operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations including investments in global streaming content free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow used in operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization noncash stockbased compensation expense and other working capital differences working capital differences include deferred revenue taxes and semiannual interest payments on our outstanding debt our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow 



year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016   

cash used in operating activities increased 3120 million  resulting in net cash used in operating activities of 17859 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  the significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments the payments for streaming content assets increased 20251 million  from 68806 million  to 89058 million  or 29  as compared to an increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of 14093 million  from 47885 million  to 61978 million  or 29  in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses primarily related to increased headcount costs to support our continued improvements in our streaming service our international expansion and increased content production activities the increased use of cash was partially offset by a 28620 million  or 32  increase in revenues 

cash provided by investing activities decreased by 154 million  primarily due to a 656 million  increase in the purchases of property and equipment largely due to the expansion of our los gatos california headquarters as well as our new office space in los angeles california this increase in cash used was partially offset by an increase of 325 million  in the proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases due to the sale of our shortterm investments in july 2017 as well as a decline in dvd purchases of 235 million  

cash provided by financing activities increased 19854 million  primarily due to the 29884 million  net proceeds from the issuance of the 3625  notes and 4875  notes in the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the 9893 million  net proceeds from the issuance of the 4375 notes in the year ended december 31 2016  

free cash flow was 25786 million  lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to 27079 million  of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and 529 million  of unfavorable other working capital differences partially offset by 1822 million  of noncash stockbased compensation expense 

year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015   

cash used in operating activities increased 7245 million  resulting in net cash used in operating activities of 14740 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments the payments for streaming content assets increased 22714 million  from 46092 million  to 68806 million  or 49  in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses the increased use of cash was partially offset by a 20512 million  or 30  increase in revenues 

cash provided by investing activities increased 2290 million  primarily due to an increase of 2436 million  in the proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases partially offset by a 164 million  increase in the purchases of property and equipment primarily driven by the expansion of our los gatos california headquarters as well as our new office space in los angeles california 

cash provided by financing activities decreased 5486 million  primarily due to the 14824 million  net proceeds from the issuance of the 550 notes and the 5875 notes in the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the 9893 million  net proceeds from the issuance of the 4375 notes in the year ended december 31 2016  

free cash flow was 18464 million  lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to 20921 million  of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by 1737 million  of noncash stockbased compensation expense and 720 million  of favorable other working capital differences 

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2017  timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2017  

  



  

 streaming content obligations increased 32 billion  from 145 billion  as of december 31 2016  to 177 billion  as of december 31 2017  primarily due to multiyear commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming 

streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content an obligation for the production of content includes noncancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements an obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity andor fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date traditional film output deals or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown are examples of these types of agreements the contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years however these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately 3 billion to 5 billion  over the next three years with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above 

  

 

 

 

as of december 31 2017  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 429 million  which was classified in “other noncurrent liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets at this time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

indemnifications 

the information set forth under note 6   guarantees  indemnification obligations  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

         the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

streaming content 

we acquire license and produce content including original programing in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of tv shows and films the content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense payments for content including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities are classified within net cash used in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

for licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming the portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “current content assets net” and the remaining portion as “noncurrent content assets net” on the consolidated balance sheets 

for productions we capitalize costs associated with the production including development cost direct costs and production overhead we include these amounts in noncurrent content assets net on the consolidated balance sheets participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs 

based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns we amortize the content assets licensed and produced in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations over the shorter of each titles contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years beginning with the month of first availability the amortization is on an accelerated basis as we typically expect more upfront viewing for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts we review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment 

our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level therefore content assets both licensed and produced are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness to date we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances if such changes are identified in the future these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost net realizable value or fair value in addition unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized at december 31 2017 the valuation allowance of 494 million was related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50  likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2017  our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 429 million  of which 379 million  if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates 

on december 22 2017  the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “act” was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35  to 21  for tax years beginning after december 31 2017   the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings we have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded 791 million  as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017  the period in which the legislation was enacted the provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was 469 million  the provisional amount related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was 322 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of 4849 million 

on december 22 2017 staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 was issued to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the act in accordance with sab 118 we have determined that the 469 million of the deferred tax expense recorded in connection with the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the 322 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate at december 31 2017 additional work is necessary for a more detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations in july 2017 we sold all shortterm investments 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2017  our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 

as of december 31 2017  we had 66 billion  of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in seven tranches due between 2021 and 2028 refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest the fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates as discussed below 

foreign currency risk 

international revenues and cost of revenues account for 44  and 54  respectively of consolidated amounts for the year ended december 31 2017  the majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies which are primarily the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the japanese yen and the brazilian real 

accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit loss of our international streaming segment as expressed in us dollars for the year ended december 31 2017  we believe our international revenues would have been approximately 219 million  lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2016  

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency in the year ended december 31 2017  we recognized a 1279 million  foreign exchange loss which resulted primarily from the remeasurement of our €13000 million senior notes and was partially offset by the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our european and us entities 

in addition the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december 31 2017  was an increase of 298 million  

we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

risk factors 

tableend 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships competitors include other entertainment video providers such as mvpds internetbased movie and tv content providers including those that provide pirated content and dvd rental outlets if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or service offerings or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members in addition many of our members rejoin our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base if we do not grow as expected given in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per membership revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of members cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members 

changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video including the potential rapid adoption of piracybased video offerings could adversely impact our business 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change through new and existing distribution channels consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market piracy in particular threatens to damage our business as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against virtually all content for free furthermore in light of the compelling consumer proposition piracy services are subject to rapid global growth traditional providers of entertainment video including broadcasters and cable network operators as well as internet based ecommerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internetbased video offerings   several of these competitors have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition and significant financial marketing and other resources they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development technology infrastructure content acquisitions and marketing new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services   with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

in connection with obtaining streaming content we typically enter into multiyear commitments with studios and other content providers the payment terms of which are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base “fixed cost” but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments are included in the contractual obligations section of item 7 managements discussion   and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 5 commitments and contingencies  in item 8  given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be 

adversely impacted payment terms for certain content commitments such as programming that is initially available in the applicable territory on our service “original programming” will typically require more upfront cash payments than other licensing agreements to the extent membership andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate if we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory or is unable to be shown in a territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

we are devoting more resources toward the development production marketing and distribution of original programming including tv series and movies we believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations in particular in terms of costs viewing and popularity our business including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service ramping up our ability to produce original content as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the us as our international offering evolves we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and internet video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty “cloud” computing services as we ramp up our original content production we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines including creative marketing legal finance and other resources related to the development and physical production of content if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content our business may be adversely affected 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 



 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

if we fail to maintain or in newer markets establish a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service including the content we offer we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we believe that a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video to the extent our content in particular our original programming is perceived as low quality offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted with newer markets we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions our business in these new markets may be adversely impacted 

changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs including social media sites such as facebook and twitter to promote our service to potential new members we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected 

if companies that promote our service decide that we negatively impact their business that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer have access to such marketing channels we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright and trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials and features on our web site such as member reviews as we expand our original programming we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we also take on risks associated with production such as completion and key talent risk negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on our service or if we become liable for content we acquire produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and 

damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected andor our costs could increase many of the licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we may see the cost of programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations “cmos” that hold certain rights to music interests in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain cmos and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with cmos or result in music publishers represented by certain cmos unilaterally withdrawing rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs 

we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected screens including tvs digital video players television settop boxes and mobile devices we have agreements with various cable satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television settop boxes of these service providers   we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing regulatory or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our device partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyberattacks could result in a loss or degradation of service unauthorized disclosure of data including member and corporate information or theft of intellectual property including digital content assets which could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks power loss telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks including cyberattacks such as computer viruses denial of service attacks physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data any attempt by hackers to obtain our data including member and corporate information or intellectual property including digital content assets disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems to date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty web hosting cloud computing or other network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services aws provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

if the technology we use in operating our business fails is unavailable or does not operate to expectations our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we utilize a combination of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices for example we have built and deployed our own contentdelivery network “cdn” to the extent internet service providers isps do not interconnect with our cdn or if we experience difficulties in its operation our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected likewise if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected we also utilize third party technology to help market our service process payments and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly our ability to operate our service retain existing members and add new members may be impaired also any harm to our members personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business certain laws 

intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries including the united states and the european union in others the laws may be nascent or nonexistent given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet if network operators block restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks our service and business could be negatively affected to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted in some international markets these same incentives apply however the consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize data supplied by our members we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect transfer and use data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information such as laws regarding data localization andor restrictions on data export failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our members including names and billing data this data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members data despite these measures we our payment processing services or other third party services we use such as aws could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members additionally we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach for these reasons should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data occur our business could be adversely affected 

we are subject to payment processing risk 

our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards gift cards direct debit and online wallets we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems increases in payment processing fees material changes in the payment ecosystem such as large reissuances of payment cards delays in receiving payments from payment processors andor changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing our revenue operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted in addition from time to time we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any copyrights patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us these matters have included patent infringements as well as consumer and securities class actions each of which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend on among other things our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations which could adversely affect our financial position 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations as of december 31 2016 we had 34 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding “notes” as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 65 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition the amounts of which are significant for more information on our streaming content obligations including those not on our consolidated balance sheet see note 5 commitments and contingencies our substantial indebtedness and other obligations including streaming content obligations may 

 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including our notes and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness including the notes and other obligations including amounts due under our streaming content obligations 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness including the notes and obligations such as our streaming content obligations these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations or other obligations then due 

if we are unable to service our debt obligations from cash flows we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations prior to maturity our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highlyskilled business product development technical and other personnel we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel which may be disruptive to our operations 

if our domestic dvd segment declines faster than anticipated our business could be adversely affected 

the number of memberships to our dvdbymail offering is declining and we anticipate that this decline will continue we believe however that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund our growth internationally to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvdbymail business is greater than we anticipate our business could be adversely affected we do not anticipate increasing resources to our dvd operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved to the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our dvdbymail service members satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in dvdbymail member cancellations which could adversely impact our business 

if the us postal service were to increase postal delivery rates or implement other changes to improve its financial position such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our domestic dvd segments contribution profit could be adversely affected 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 



 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

financial forecasting may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues contribution margins net income and number of total and paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview and results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  increased as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  due to growth in the average number of paid streaming memberships globally the majority of which was growth in our international memberships reflecting our expansion and focus on netflix as a global internet tv network the impact from membership growth was coupled with an increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from price changes and plan mix partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our international streaming segment the increase in operating income and net income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire license and produce content including more netflix originals as well as increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion net income was further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuances as well as to an increase in our effective tax rate slightly offset by gains on foreign currency denominated transactions we intend to focus on growing our global operating margin in 2017 

we offer three types of streaming membership plans in the us our basic plan is priced at 799 per month and includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time our standard plan is our most popular streaming plan and is priced at 999 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently our premium plan is priced at 1199 per month and includes access to high definition and ultrahigh definition quality content on four screens concurrently internationally the membership plans are structured similarly to the us and range in price from the us dollar equivalent of approximately 500 to 1800 per month 

we expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change for instance in may 2014 in the us we increased the price of our standard plan from 799 per month to 899 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period in october 2015 in the us we increased the price of this same standard plan from 899 per month to 999 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period in 2016 we phased out grandfathered pricing giving members the option of electing the basic streaming plan at 799 per month continuing on the standard streaming plan at the higher price of 999 per month or electing the premium plan at 1199 per month 

the following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations 

 



delivery expenses therefore include equipment costs related to open connect and all thirdparty costs such as cloud computing costs associated with delivering streaming content over the internet cost of revenues in the domestic dvd segment consist primarily of delivery expenses content expenses including amortization of dvd content assets and revenue sharing expenses and other expenses associated with our dvd processing and customer service centers delivery expenses for the domestic dvd segment consist of the postage costs to mail dvds to and from our members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers 

 

 

segment results

in the domestic streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the united states the increase  in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 12  growth in the average number of paid memberships and an 8  increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership the average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 15 compared to the same quarter in prior year these increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix in 2016 we phased out grandfathered pricing and cancellations by members whose grandfathered pricing expired were not material our standard plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new memberships 

 the increase  in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a 3354 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming in addition we had a 332 million increase in other costs such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers due to our growing member base 

domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending as well as increased payments to our partners

fluctuations 

international marketing expenses increased  mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months

year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014   

the increase in our international revenues was due to the 66  growth in the average number of paid international memberships offset partially by a 10 decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership the decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher vat rates across our european markets beginning january 1 2015 these decreases were partially offset by our pricing changes and plan mix we believe international revenues would have been approximately 331 million higher in 2015 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2014 

the increase  in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 5221 million increase in content expenses primarily relating to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months coupled with existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 1042 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 35 of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2015  as compared to 27 of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2014

the decrease in our domestic dvd revenues was due to a 15  decrease in the average number of paid memberships 

the decrease in domestic dvd cost of revenues was primarily due to a 140 million decrease in content expenses and a 328 million decrease in delivery expenses resulting from a 18 decrease in the number of dvds mailed to members the decrease in shipments was driven by a decline in the number of dvd memberships coupled with a decrease in usage by these 

members other costs primarily those associated with processing and customer service expenses decreased 144 million primarily due to a decrease in hub operation expenses resulting from the decline in dvd shipments 

our domestic dvd segment had a contribution margin of 52  for the year ended december 31 2016  up from 50  for the year ended december 31 2015  due to the decrease in dvd usage by paying members

provision for income taxes 

year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015   

 the increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to a 134 million release of tax reserves in 2015 and an increase in foreign taxes in 2016 the difference between our 28 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 173 million primarily due to the 2016 federal and california research and development “rd” credits partially offset by state income taxes foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses 

  

year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014   

the decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to an increase in rd credits and a decrease in state and local income taxes in 2015 the difference between our 14 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 304 million primarily due to a 134 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of an irs audit settlement leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years 165 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 federal rd credit as well as the california rd credit partially offset by state income taxes foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses on december 18 2015 the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 hr 2029 was signed into law which retroactively and permanently extended the federal rd credit from january 1 2015 as a result we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2015 rd credit as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2015 the period in which the legislation was enacted 

liquidity and capital resources 

 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments decreased   5769 million  from 23107 million  as of december 31 2015  to 17338 million  as of december 31 2016  in october 2016 we issued 10000 million of longterm debt the decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in cash used in operations partially offset by cash received from the issuance of debt longterm debt net of debt issuance costs was 33643 million and 23714 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our primary uses of cash include the acquisition licensing and production of content streaming delivery marketing programs and personnelrelated costs investments in original content and in particular content that we produce and own require more cash upfront relative to licensed content we expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content particularly in original content which will impact our liquidity and may result in future negative free cash flows even after we achieve material global profitability 

we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with available funds and access to financing sources will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to obtain any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance financial condition and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

as of december 31 2016  cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to 2785 million if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by used in operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments in content and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations including investments in global streaming content free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation 

of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow used in provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expense noncash stockbased compensation expense and other working capital differences the excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments such as licensing and production of original content in the last 12 months the ratio of content payments over content expense was 14 working capital differences include deferred revenue taxes and semiannual interest payments on our outstanding debt our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow 



year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015   

cash used in operating activities increased 7245 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of 14740 million for the year ended december 31 2016  the significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments the payments for streaming content assets increased 22714 million from 46092 million to 68806 million or 49 in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses the increased use of cash was partially offset by a 20512 million or 30 increase in revenues 

cash provided by investing activities increased 2290 million primarily due to an increase of 2436 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases partially offset by a 164 million increase in the purchases of property and equipment primarily driven by the expansion of our los gatos california headquarters as well as our new office space in los angeles california

cash provided by operating activities decreased 7659 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of 7494 million for the year ended december 31 2015  the significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments the payments for streaming assets increased 14293 million from 31799 million to 46092 million or 45 in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses the increased use of cash was partially offset by a 12749 million or 23 increase in revenues 

cash used in investing activities increased 1363 million primarily due to a decrease of 1084 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases in addition purchases of property and equipment increased by 215 million primarily driven by the expansion of our los gatos california headquarters

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2016  timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2016  

  



  

 streaming content obligations increased 36 billion from 109 billion as of december 31 2015  to 145 billion as of december 31 2016  primarily due to multiyear commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming 

streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content an obligation for the production of content includes noncancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements an obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity andor fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date traditional film output deals like the us output deal with disney or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown are examples of these types of agreements the contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years however these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately 3 billion to 5 billion over the next three years with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above 

  



 

 

as of december 31 2016  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 197 million which was classified in “other noncurrent liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets at this time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

        we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us

critical accounting policies and estimates 

         the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

streaming content 

we acquire license and produce content including original programing in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of tv shows and films the content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense payments for content including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities are classified within net cash used in provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

for licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming the portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “current content assets net” and the remaining portion as “noncurrent content assets net” on the consolidated balance sheets 

for productions we capitalize costs associated with the production including development cost and direct costs we include these amounts in noncurrent content assets net on the consolidated balance sheets participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs 

based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns we amortize the content assets licensed and produced in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations over the shorter of each titles contractual window of availability or estimated period of use beginning with the month of first availability the amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years for content where we expect more upfront viewing for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts we amortize on an accelerated basis we review factors that impact the 

amortization of the content assets on a regular basis our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment in the third quarter of 2016 we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content the effect of this change in estimate was a 198 million decrease in operating income and a 123 million decrease in net income for the year ended december 31 2016 the effect on both basic and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of 003 for the year ended december 31 2016 changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations 

our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level therefore content assets both licensed and produced are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness or that the fair value may be less than amortized cost to date we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances if such changes are identified in the future these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost net realizable value or fair value in addition unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off no material writedown from unamortized cost was recorded in any of the periods presented 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain there was no significant valuation allowance as of december 31 2016  or 2015  

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2016  our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 197 million of which 170 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 

stockbased compensation 

we grant fully vested nonqualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for postvesting option forfeitures stockbased compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments debt and foreign currency fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 

for the year ended december 31 2016  we had no impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2016  our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset backed securities 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as shortterm investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates as of december 31 2016  

  



a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2016  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as shortterm investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the analysis is shown as of december 31 2016  

  



  

based on investment positions as of december 31 2016  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 39 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of december 31 2015  a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a 66 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of december 31 2016  we had 34 billion  of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in five tranches refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

foreign currency risk 

international revenues and cost of revenues account for 36  and 48  respectively of consolidated amounts for the year ended december 31 2016  the majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies which are primarily the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar and the brazilian real 

accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit loss of our international streaming segment as expressed in us dollars for the year ended december 31 2016  we believe our international revenues would have been approximately 1744 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2015  

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency in the year ended december 31 2016  we recognized a 228 million foreign exchange gain which resulted primarily from the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies 

we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

risk factors 

tableend 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships competitors include other entertainment video providers such as mvpds internetbased movie and tv content providers including those that provide pirated content and dvd rental outlets if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or service offerings or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members in addition many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base if growth rates slow faster than expected given in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per membership revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of members cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members 

changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video including the potential rapid adoption of piracybased video offerings could adversely impact our business 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change through new and existing distribution channels consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market piracy in particular threatens to damage our business as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against virtually all content for free furthermore in light of the compelling consumer proposition piracy services are subject to rapid global growth traditional providers of entertainment video including broadcasters and cable network operators as well as internet based ecommerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internetbased video offerings   several of these competitors have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition and significant financial marketing and other resources they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development technology infrastructure content acquisitions and marketing new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services   with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

in connection with obtaining streaming content we typically enter into multiyear commitments with studios and other content providers the payment terms of which are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base “fixed cost” but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments are included in the contractual obligations section of item 7 managements discussion   and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 6 commitments and contingencies  in item 8  given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be 

adversely impacted payment terms for certain content commitments such as programming that is initially available in the applicable territory on our service “original programming” will typically require more upfront cash payments than other licensing agreements to the extent membership andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate as we have expanded internationally we have licensed content in advance of entering into a new geographical market if we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in the applicable territory or is unable to be shown in the applicable territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

we are devoting more resources toward the development production marketing and distribution of original programming including tv series and movies we believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations in particular in terms of costs viewing and popularity our business including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service ramping up our ability to produce original content as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the us as we expand internationally we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and internet video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty “cloud” computing services as we ramp up our original content production we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines including creative marketing legal finance and other resources related to the development and physical production of content if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content our business may be adversely affected 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 

 4 

 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

if we fail to maintain or in new markets establish a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service including the content we offer we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we believe that a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video to the extent our content in particular our original programming is perceived as low quality offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted as we expand into new markets we will also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions our business in these new markets may be adversely impacted 

changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs including social media sites such as facebook and twitter to promote our service to potential new members we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected 

if companies that promote our service decide that we negatively impact their business that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer have access to such marketing channels we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright and trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials and features on our web site such as member reviews as we expand our original programming we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we also take on risks associated with production such as completion and key talent risk to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on our service or if we become liable for content we acquire produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected andor our costs could increase many of the licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we may see the cost of programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations “cmos” that hold certain rights to music interests in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain cmos and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with cmos or result in music publishers represented by certain cmos unilaterally withdrawing rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs 

we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected screens including tvs digital video players television settop boxes and mobile devices we have agreements with various cable satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television settop boxes of these service providers   we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing regulatory or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our device partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyberattacks could result in a loss or degradation of service unauthorized disclosure of data including member and corporate information or theft of intellectual property including digital content assets which could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks power loss telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks including cyberattacks such as computer viruses denial of service attacks physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data any attempt by hackers to obtain our data including member and corporate 

information or intellectual property including digital content assets disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems to date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty web hosting cloud computing or other network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services aws provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

if the technology we use in operating our business fails is unavailable or does not operate to expectations our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we utilize a combination of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices for example we have built and deployed our own contentdelivery network “cdn” to the extent internet service providers isps do not interconnect with our cdn or if we experience difficulties in its operation our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected likewise if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected we also utilize third party technology to help market our service process payments and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly our ability to operate our service retain existing members and add new members may be impaired also any harm to our members personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business the failure to adopt laws protecting strong net neutrality could also increase the cost of doing business in the united states on february 16 2015 the federal communications commission fcc adopted net neutrality rules intended in part to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks and to prevent isp abuses at interconnection points the fccs authority to adopt these rules is currently under review by the us court of appeals for the district of 

columbia to the extent network operators attempt to use this ruling to extract fees from us to deliver our traffic or otherwise engage in discriminatory practices or if the us court of appeals for the district of columbia invalidates the rules our business could be adversely impacted regulators outside the united states including the european union have adopted or may adopt network neutrality rules it is also possible that network neutrality rules may be nascent or nonexistent in the global markets in which we operate within such a regulatory environment coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet if network operators block restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks our service and business could be negatively affected to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted in some international markets these same incentives apply however the consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize data supplied by our members we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect and use data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results as our business evolves and as we expand internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information such as laws regarding data localization andor restrictions on data export failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses for instance in october 2015 the european court of justice overturned the euus safe harbor program under which companies were able to transfer personal data from the eu to the us in a legally compliant manner if other legally compliant forms of data transfer are similarly invalidated by courts or other authorities in the eu we may need to alter our business practices and which may adversely affect our business 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our members including names and billing data this data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members data despite these measures we our payment processing services or other third party services we use such as aws could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members additionally we could face legal claims for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach for these reasons should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data occur our business could be adversely affected 

we are subject to payment processing risk 

our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards gift cards direct debit and online wallets we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems increases in payment processing fees material changes in the payment ecosystem such as large reissuances of payment cards delays in receiving payments from payment processors andor changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing our revenue operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted in addition from time to time we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any copyrights patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us these matters have included patent infringements as well as consumer and securities class actions each of which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend on among other things our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

we have debt outstanding and may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of december 31 2015 we had 2400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 it is possible that we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highlyskilled business product development technical and other personnel we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel which may be disruptive to our operations 

if memberships to our domestic dvd segment decline faster than anticipated our business could be adversely affected 

the number of memberships to our dvdbymail offering is declining and we anticipate that this decline will continue we believe however that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund our growth internationally to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvdbymail business is greater than we anticipate our business could be adversely affected we do not anticipate increasing resources to our dvd operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved to the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our dvdbymail service members satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in dvdbymail member cancellations which could adversely impact our business 

changes in us postal rates or operations could adversely impact our operating results and member satisfaction 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our members increases in postage delivery rates including those resulting from changes to policies on the requirements of first class mail such as size weight or machinability could adversely affect our domestic dvd segments contribution profit if the us postal service were to implement other changes to improve its financial position such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our domestic dvd segments contribution profit could be adversely affected 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

financial forecasting may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues contribution margins net income and number of total and paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview and results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



consolidated revenues for 2015  and 2014  increased as compared to prior years due to growth in global streaming average paying memberships the majority of which was growth in our international memberships reflecting our expansion and focus on netflix as a global internet tv network for the year ended december 31 2015 the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting from unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our international streaming segment this was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes and plan mix the decrease in operating income for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 is due primarily to increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire license and produce content including more netflix originals net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first quarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions 

we offer three types of streaming membership plans in the us our basic plan is priced at 799 per month and includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time our most popular streaming plan is priced at 999 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently our premium plan is priced at 1199 per month and includes access to high definition and ultrahigh definition quality content on four screens concurrently internationally the membership plans are structured similarly to the us and range in price from the us dollar equivalent of approximately 500 to 1800 per month 

we expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change for instance in the second half of 2015 we increased the price of our twoscreen high definition plan in the us and several european countries in may 2014 in the us we increased the price of our high definition plan from 799 per month to 899 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period in october 2015 in the us we increased the price of this same high definition plan from 899 per month to 999 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period in 2016 the grandfathered pricing period will expire for a substantial number of us memberships and the members will have the option of electing the basic streaming plan at 799 or continuing on the high definition plan at the higher price of 999 

the following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations 

 

 17 

own global content delivery network open connect to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet streaming delivery expenses therefore also include equipment costs related to our content delivery network and all thirdparty costs such as cloud computing costs associated with delivering streaming content over the internet cost of revenues in the domestic dvd segment consist primarily of delivery expenses content expenses including amortization of dvd content assets and revenue sharing expenses and other expenses associated with our dvd processing and customer service centers delivery expenses for the domestic dvd segment consist of the postage costs to mail dvds to and from our members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers 

 

 

segment results 

domestic streaming segment 



year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014   

in the domestic streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the united states our two screen high definition plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new memberships the increase  in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 17 growth in the average number of paid memberships and a 4  increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from our price changes and plan mix 

the increase  in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a 2081 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming in addition we had a 379 million increase in streaming delivery expenses and a 394 million increase in other costs such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers due to our growing member base 

domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending 

our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 33  for the year ended december 31 2015 which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 27  for the year ended december 31 2014 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue which continued to outpace content and marketing spending our 2020 domestic streaming contribution margin target remains at 40 

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013   

 the increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to the 22 growth in the average number of paid memberships as well as to the 2 increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from our price increase for new members in the second quarter of 2014 and introduction of the higher priced plan in 2013 

 the increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to the 2423 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming in addition streaming delivery expenses increased by 595 million and other costs such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers increased 366 million due to our growing member base 

 domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending 

our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 27 for the year ended december 31 2014 which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 23 for the year ended december 31 2013 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue which continued to outpace content and marketing spending 

international streaming segment 



in the international streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the united states we launched our streaming service in canada in september 2010 and have continuously expanded our services internationally as shown below in january 2016 we announced the availability of our streaming service virtually everywhere in the world with the exception of the peoples republic of china and territories where us companies are not allowed to operate 

year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 

the increase in our international revenues was due to the 66 growth in the average number of paid international memberships offset partially by a 10 decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership the decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher vat rates across our european markets beginning january 1 2015 these decreases were partially offset by our pricing changes and plan mix we believe international revenues would have been approximately 331 million higher in 2015 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2014 

the increase  in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 5221 million increase in content expenses primarily relating to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months coupled with existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 1042 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 35 of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2015 as compared to 27 of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2014 

international marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 increased  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months 

international contribution losses increased   1736 million  year over year due to our increased spending for our international expansion and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013   

the increase in our international revenues was primarily due to the 82 growth in the average number of paid international memberships as well as the 1 increase in average monthly revenue per paying member resulting from the price increase on our most popular streaming plan and the introduction of the premium plan offset partially by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 27 of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2014 as compared to 20 of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2013 

the increase  in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 3115 million increase in content expenses including content for our new markets as well as more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 603 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base 

international marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 increased as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 mainly due to expenses for territories launched during 2014 

international contribution losses improved  1145 million year over year as a result of growing memberships and revenues faster than content and marketing spending

in the domestic dvd segment we derive revenues from our dvdbymail membership services the price per plan for dvdbymail varies from 499 to 1599 per month according to the plan chosen by the member dvdbymail plans differ by the number of dvds that a member may have out at any given point members electing access to high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds pay a surcharge ranging from 2 to 4 per month for our most popular plans 

the decrease in our domestic dvd revenues was due to a 16 decrease in the average number of paid memberships 

the decrease in domestic dvd cost of revenues was primarily due to a 210 million decrease in content expenses and a 389 million decrease in delivery expenses resulting from a 21 decrease in the number of dvds mailed to members the decrease in shipments was driven by a decline in the number of dvd memberships coupled with a decrease in usage by these members other costs primarily those associated with processing and customer service expenses decreased 131 million primarily due to a decrease in hub operation expenses resulting from the decline in dvd shipments 

our domestic dvd segment had a contribution margin of 50  for the year ended december 31 2015 up from 48 for the year ended december 31 2014 due to the decrease in dvd usage by paying members

year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2015 consists primarily of 1271 million of interest on our notes the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 is due to the higher aggregate principal of interest bearing notes outstanding 

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014 consists primarily of 468 million of interest on our notes the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 is due to the higher aggregate principal of interest bearing notes outstanding 

interest and other income expense

year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 

interest and other income expense decreased for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year due to a 373 million foreign exchange loss incurred primarily in the first quarter of 2015 the foreign exchange loss was primarily driven by the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in our european entities coupled with the strengthening of the us dollar 

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 

interest and other income expense for the year ended december 31 2014 was relatively flat as compared to the prior year losses on foreign currency denominated balances were 82 million and 84 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

extinguishment of debt 

in connection with the redemption of the outstanding 2000 million aggregate principal amount of the 850 notes we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 251 million in the year ended december 31 2013 which consisted of expenses associated with the redemption including a 194 million premium payment pursuant to the makewhole provision in the indenture governing the 850 notes for further detail see note 5 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

provision for income taxes 

year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 

the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 is mainly due to an increase in rd credits and a decrease in state and local income taxes 

in 2015 the difference between our 14 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 304 million primarily due to a 134 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of an irs audit settlement leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years 165 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 federal research and development “rd” credit and the california rd credit partially offset by state income taxes foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses 

on december 18 2015 the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 hr 2029 was signed into law which retroactively and permanently extended the federal rd credit from january 1 2015 as a result we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2015 rd credit as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2015 the period in which the legislation was enacted 

  

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 

the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 was primarily attributable to the 386 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits 

in 2014 the difference between our 24 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 397 million primarily due to a 386 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of an irs appeals settlement for the tax years 20082009 leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years 107 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2014 federal rd credit and the california rd credit partially offset by state income taxes foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses 

on december 19 2014 the tax increase prevention act of 2014 hr 5771 was signed into law which retroactively extended the federal rd credit from january 1 2014 through december 31 2014 as a result we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2014 federal rd credit as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2014 the period in which the legislation was enacted 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased 7022 million to 23107 million from 16085 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively in february 2015 we issued 15000 million of longterm debt and in february 2014 we issued 4000 million of longterm debt the increases in cash in the year ended december 31 2015 associated with the issuance of debt was partially offset by cash outflows from operations and investing activities longterm debt net of debt issuance costs was 23714 million and 8858 million as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively see note 5  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

our primary uses of cash include the acquisition licensing and production of content streaming delivery marketing programs and payroll investments in original content and in particular content that we produce and own require more cash upfront relative to licensed content we expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content particularly in original content which could impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows 

although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with our available funds will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months to fund our continued content investments we are likely to raise additional capital in future periods our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain to finance our international expansion or investment in original content or otherwise will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

as of december 31 2015 2003 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries for which we could be required to accrue and pay taxes is 653 million see note 10 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash used in provided by operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments and for certain other activities free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow used in provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expense noncash stockbased compensation expense and other working capital differences the excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments such as licensing and production of original content in 2015 the ratio of content payments over content expense was between 13 and 14 working capital differences include deferred revenue taxes and semiannual interest payments on our outstanding debt our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow 



year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014   

cash provided by operating activities decreased 7659 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of 7494 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that requires more upfront payments the payments for content excluding dvd assets increased 13748 million or 40 in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses the increased use of cash was partially offset by a 12749 million or 23 increase in revenues 

cash used in investing activities increased 1363 million primarily due to a decrease of 1084 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases in addition purchases of property and equipment increased by 215 million 

cash provided by financing activities increased 10986 million primarily due to the 14824 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 550 notes and the 5875 notes in the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the 3929 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5750 notes in the year ended december 31 2014 

free cash flow was 10432 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to 12094 million of content cash payments over expense partially offset by 1247 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense and 415 million of favorable other working capital differences 

free cash flow was 3935 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily due to 5342 million of content cash payments over expense partially offset by 1152 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense and 255 million of favorable other working capital differences 

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013   

cash provided by operating activities decreased 813 million primarily due to increased payments for content other than dvd assets of 8351 million or 32 as well as increased payments associated with higher operating expenses the increased use of cash was partially offset by a 11301 million or 26 increase in revenues 

cash used in investing activities decreased 2131 million primarily due to a decrease of 2422 million in the purchases of shortterm investments net of proceeds from sales and maturities this decrease was offset by an increase of 156 million purchases of property and equipment 

cash provided by financing activities increased 654 million primarily due to the 3929 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5750 notes in the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the 4906 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5375 notes less the 2194 million redemption of our 850 notes in the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 563 million from the issuance of common stock including the impact of excess tax benefits 

free cash flow was 1287 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to 2279 million of content cash payments over expense and 453 million nonfavorable other working capital differences this was partially offset by 731 million noncash stockbased compensation expense 463 million in deferred revenue and 251 million loss on debt extinguishment the cash impact of which is a financing activity and therefore not included in free cash flow 

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2015 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2015 

  



  

 streaming content obligations increased 14 billion from 95 billion as of december 31 2014 to 109 billion as of december 31 2015 primarily due to multiyear commitments primarily associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programing 

streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition licensing and production of streaming content an obligation for the production of content includes noncancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements an obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement 

to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity and  or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date traditional film output deals like the us output deal with disney or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown are examples of these types of agreements the contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years however these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately 3 billion to 5 billion over the next three years with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above 

  

 

 

 

as of december 31 2015 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 171 million of which 36 million was recorded in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets for the remaining 135 million we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

indemnifications

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

streaming content 

we acquire license and produce content including original programming in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of tv shows and films the content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense payments for content including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities are classified within net cash used in provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

for licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming the portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “current content assets net” and the remaining portion as “noncurrent content assets net” on the consolidated balance sheets 

for productions we capitalize costs associated with the production including development cost and direct costs we include these amounts in noncurrent content assets net on the consolidated balance sheets participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs 

based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns we amortize the content assets licensed and produced in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations over the shorter of each titles contractual window of availability or estimated period of use beginning with the month of first availability the amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years for most of our content we amortize on a straightline basis for certain content where we expect more upfront viewing due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts we amortize on an accelerated basis we review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis including changes in merchandising and marketing efforts our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations in the third quarter of 2015 we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content the effect of this change in estimate was a 255 million increase in cost of revenues in the domestic streaming segment for the year ended december 31 2015 

content assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value which approximates fair value of the capitalized costs for produced content content assets are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level for writedown when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off no material writedown from unamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented 

we have entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations cmos and are currently involved in negotiations with other cmos that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works publicly performed in connection with streaming content into various territories accruals for estimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates these amounts are included in the streaming content obligations the results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from managements estimates 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain there was no valuation allowance as of december 31 2015 or 2014 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2015 our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 171 million of which 135 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates see note 10 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information regarding income taxes 

stockbased compensation 

we grant fully vested nonqualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for postvesting option forfeitures stockbased compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards 

we calculate the fair value of our stock option grants using a latticebinomial model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments debt and foreign currency fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 

for the year ended december 31 2015  we had no impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2015  our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk 

because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset backed securities 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as shortterm investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates as of december 31 2015 

  



a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2015  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as shortterm investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the analysis is shown as of december 31 2015  

  



  

based on investment positions as of december 31 2015 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 66 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of december 31 2014 a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a 59 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of december 31 2015 we had 24 billion of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in four tranches 5000 million of 5375 notes due in 2021 4000 million of 5750 notes due in 2024 7000 million of 550 notes due in 2022 and 8000 million of 5875 notes due in 2025 the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

foreign currency risk 

international revenues and cost of revenues account for 29 and 39 respectively of consolidated amounts for the year ended december 31 2015 the majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies which are primarily the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the australian dollar the japanese yen and the brazilian real 

accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit loss of our international streaming segment as expressed in us dollars for the year ended december 31 2015 we believe our international revenues would have been approximately 331 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31 2014 

we have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency in the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized a 373 million foreign exchange loss which resulted primarily from the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in our european entities coupled with the strengthening of the us dollar 

we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

our core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment contribution profit loss targets we are continuously improving our members experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members we are continually enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more internetconnected screens

prior to july 2011 in the us our streaming and dvdbymail operations were combined and members could receive both streaming content and dvds under a single “hybrid” plan in july 2011 we separated the combined plans making it necessary for members who wish to receive both dvdsbymail and streaming content to have two separate membership plans 

business segments 

the company has three reportable segments domestic streaming international streaming and domestic dvd the domestic and international streaming segments derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content the domestic dvd segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of dvdbymail for additional information regarding our segments including information about our financial results by geography see note 12  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

competition 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change we compete against other entertainment video providers such as multichannel video programming distributors mvpds internetbased movie and tv content providers including those that provide pirated content and dvd rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time we also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects 

while consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time we have often referred to this choice as our objective of winning moments of truth in attempting to win these moments of truth with our members we are continually improving our service including both our technology and our content which is increasingly exclusive and curated including our own original programming 

seasonality 

our member growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internetconnected devices and when they tend to increase their viewing our domestic member growth is generally greatest in our fourth and first quarters october through march slowing in our second quarter april through june and then accelerating in our third quarter july through september we expect each market in our international steaming segment to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns additionally the variable expenses associated with shipments of dvds are highest in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of dvd usage

risk factors 

tableend 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant member growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members competitors include other entertainment video providers such as mvpds internetbased movie and tv content providers including those that provide pirated content and dvd rental outlets if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or service offerings or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members in addition many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new members both to replace members who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current member base if growth rates slow faster than expected given in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per member revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing members and attracting new members our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of members cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members 

changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video including the potential rapid adoption of piracybased video offerings could adversely impact our business 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change through new and existing distribution channels consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market piracy in particular threatens to damage our business as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against virtually all content for free furthermore in light of the compelling consumer proposition piracy services are subject to rapid global growth traditional providers of entertainment video including broadcasters and cable network operators as well as internet based ecommerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internetbased video offerings   several of these competitors have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition and significant financial marketing and other resources they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development technology infrastructure content acquisitions and marketing new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services   with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

in connection with obtaining streaming content we typically enter into multiyear commitments with studios and other content providers the payment terms of which are not tied to member usage or the size of our member base “fixed cost” but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments are included in the contractual obligations section of item 7 managements discussion   and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 6 commitments and contingencies  in item 8  given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments if member acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be adversely impacted payment terms for certain content commitments such as programming that is initially available in the 

applicable territory on our service “original programming” will typically require more upfront cash payments than other licensing agreements to the extent member andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate as we expand internationally we must license content in advance of entering into a new geographical market if we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in the applicable territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

we are devoting more resources toward the development production marketing and distribution of original programming including tv series and movies we believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations in particular in terms of costs viewing and popularity our business including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the us as we expand internationally we are managing our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and internet video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty “cloud” computing services if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations our business may be adversely affected 

if we fail to maintain or in new markets establish a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service including the content we offer we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we believe that a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video to the extent our content in particular our original programming is perceived as low quality offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted furthermore to the extent our marketing customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted as we expand into new markets we will also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions our business in these new markets may be adversely impacted 

changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and member levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs including social media sites such as facebook and twitter to promote our service to potential new members we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected 

if companies that promote our service decide that we negatively impact their business that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer have access to such marketing channels we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we develop produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright and trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials and features on our website such as member reviews as we expand our original programming we will become responsible for production costs and other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we will also take on risks associated with production such as completion and key talent risk to 

the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on our service or if we become liable for content we develop produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected andor our costs could increase many of the licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we may see the cost of programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with performing rights organizations and collection societies “pros” that hold certain rights to music interests in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain pros and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with pros or result in music publishers represented by certain pros unilaterally withdrawing rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs 

we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected devices including tvs digital video players television settop boxes and mobile devices we have agreements with various cable satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television settop boxes of these service providers   we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our device partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber attacks could result in a loss or degradation of service unauthorized disclosure of data including both member and corporate information and could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks power loss telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections 

service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks including cyber attacks such as computer viruses denial of service attacks physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data any attempt by hackers to obtain our data disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems or those of third parties we use if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems to date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty web hosting cloud computing or content delivery network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions as well as cybersecurity threats could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services aws provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

if the technology we use in operating our business fails is unavailable or does not operate to expectations our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we utilize a combination of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices for example we have built and deployed our own contentdelivery network “cdn” to the extent internet service providers isps do not interconnect with our cdn or if we experience difficulties in its operation our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected likewise if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected we also utilize third party technology to help market our service process payments and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly our ability to operate our service retain existing members and add new members may be impaired also any harm to our members personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business the failure to adopt laws protecting strong net neutrality could also increase the cost of doing business for example in late 2010 the federal communications commission fcc adopted net neutrality rules intended in part to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks the us court of appeals for the district of columbia subsequently struck down the fcc’s net neutrality rules and it is currently uncertain how the fcc will respond to this decision to the extent network operators attempt to use this ruling to extract fees from us to deliver our traffic or otherwise engage in discriminatory practices our business could be adversely impacted as we expand internationally government regulations concerning the internet in particular net neutrality may be nascent or nonexistent within such a regulatory environment coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success for example comcast exempted certain of its own internet video traffic eg streampix videos to the xbox 360 from a bandwidth cap that applies to all unaffiliated internet video traffic eg netflix videos to the xbox 360 while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted in some international markets these same incentives apply however the consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our member data and disclosure of member data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize data supplied by our members we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect and use data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results as our business evolves and as we expand internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer information failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our member data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our members including names and billing data this data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members data despite these measures we our payment processing services or other third party services we use such as aws could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members additionally we could face legal claims for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach for these reasons should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data occur our business could be adversely affected 

we are subject to payment processing risk 

our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards gift subscriptions and direct debit we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems increases in payment processing fees andor changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing our revenue operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted in addition from time to time we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any copyrights patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us 

most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that may be different from and incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 

 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

we have debt outstanding and may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of december 31 2014 we had 500 million in 5375 senior notes and 400 million in 575 senior notes risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 we intend to raise at least 1 billion pending market conditions of additional longterm debt in the first quarter of 2015 and it is possible that we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highlyskilled business product development technical and other personnel we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel which may be disruptive to our operations 

if memberships to our domestic dvd segment decline faster than anticipated our business could be adversely affected 

the number of memberships to our dvdbymail offering is declining and we anticipate that this decline will continue we believe however that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund our growth internationally to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvdbymail business is greater than we anticipate our business could be adversely affected we do not anticipate increasing resources to our dvd operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved to the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our dvdbymail service members satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in dvdbymail member cancellations which could adversely impact our business 

changes in us postal rates or operations could adversely impact our operating results and member satisfaction 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our members increases in postage delivery rates including those resulting from changes to policies on the requirements of first class mail such as size weight or machinability could adversely affect our domestic dvd segments contribution profit if the us postal service were to implement other changes to improve its financial position such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our domestic dvd segments contribution profit could be adversely affected 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has 

held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

financial forecasting may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues contribution margins net income and number of total and paid member additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview and results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



consolidated revenues for 2014 and 2013 increased as compared to prior years due to growth in both international and domestic streaming memberships as well as increases in average revenue per paying member resulting from the introduction of higher priced plans the increases in operating income and net income in each of the two years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 were due to the increase in revenues partially offset by the increase in the cost of revenues due to increased content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content 

we offer three types of streaming membership plans in the us our basic plan is priced at 799 per month and includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time our most popular streaming plan which includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently is priced at 899 per month for members who joined after the second quarter of 2014 when we had increased the membership fee from 799 per month existing members were grandfathered in at 799 for two years as long as they remain a member our premium plan which we introduced in the second quarter of 2013 is priced at 1199 per month and includes access to high definition and ultrahigh definition quality content on four screens concurrently internationally pricing for the three types of membership plans is structured similar to the us and ranges from the us dollar equivalent of approximately 600 per month to 1900 

the following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations

segment results 

domestic streaming segment 

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 



in the domestic streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a membership plan the increase  in our domestic streaming revenues was due to the 22 growth in the average number of paid memberships as well as to the 2  increase in average monthly revenue per paying member resulting from our price increase for new members in the second quarter of 2014 and introduction of the higher priced plan in 2013 our two screen high definition plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new members 

the increase  in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to the 2423 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming in addition streaming delivery expenses increased by 595 million and other costs such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers increased 366 million due to our growing member base 

marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending 

our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 27  for the year ended december 31 2014 which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 23  for the year ended december 31 2013 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue which continued to outpace content and marketing spending the decrease in net membership additions in the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 is a natural progression of our large domestic market as we grow we expect to continue to increase domestic contribution margins over the next several years even with lower membership growth 

year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 



 the increase  in our domestic streaming revenues was due to the 26 growth in the average number of paid memberships new member additions and revenue related to 1199 membership plans that were introduced in the second quarter of 2013 were not material for the year ended december 31 2013 

the increase  in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to the 2263 million increase in content expenses resulting from continued investments in existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming in addition streaming delivery expenses increased by 317 million and other costs such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers increased 348 million due to our growing member base 

 marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising partially offset by a decrease in payments to affiliates in the us 

our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 23  for the year ended december 31 2013 which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 17  for the year ended december 31 2012 as a result of growing memberships and revenue faster than content and marketing spending 

international streaming segment 

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 



in the international streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a membership plan we launched our streaming service in canada in september 2010 and have continuously expanded our services internationally with launches in latin america in september 2011 the uk and ireland in january 2012 finland denmark sweden and norway in october 2012 the netherlands in september 2013 and germany austria switzerland france belgium and luxembourg in september 2014 in the first quarter of 2015 we expect to launch our service in australia and new zealand later in the year we expect to launch additional major countries in keeping with our global strategy 

the increase  in our international revenues was primarily due to the 82 growth in the average number of paid international memberships as well as the 1 increase in average monthly revenue per paying member resulting from the price increase on our most popular streaming plan and the introduction of the premium plan offset partially by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations average paid international streaming memberships account for 27 of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2014 as compared to 20 of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31 2013 

the increase  in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 3115 million increase in content expenses including content for our new markets as well as more exclusive and original programming other costs increased 603 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base 

international marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 increased  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last twelve months 

international contribution losses improved   1145 million  year over year as a result of growing memberships and revenues faster than content and marketing spending our international streaming segment does not benefit from the established member base that exists for the domestic segments as a result of having to build a member base from zero investments in streaming content and marketing programs for our international segment are larger initially relative to revenues in particular as new territories are launched the contribution losses for our international segment have been significant due to investments in streaming content and marketing programs to drive membership growth and viewing in our international markets 

year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 



the increase  in our international revenues was primarily due to the 134 growth in the average number of paid international memberships 

the increase  in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 2720 million increase in content expenses this increase was primarily attributable to continued investments in existing and new streaming content including content to support the launch of our service in the nordics launched in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the netherlands launched in the third quarter of 2013 other costs increased 270 million due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base 

international marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 increased  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 due to our expansion in the nordics and the netherlands offset partially by a decrease in spending in other territories 

international contribution losses improved  1148 million year over year as a result of growing memberships and revenues faster than content and marketing spending 

domestic dvd segment 

year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 



in the domestic dvd segment we derive revenues from our dvdbymail membership services the price per plan for dvdbymail varies from 499 to 4399 per month according to the plan chosen by the member dvdbymail plans differ by the number of dvds that a member may have out at any given point members electing access to high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds pay a surcharge ranging from 2 to 4 per month for our most popular plans 

the decrease in our domestic dvd revenues was due to a 16 decrease in the average number of paid memberships 

the decrease in domestic dvd cost of revenues was primarily due to a 160 million decrease in content expenses and a 430 million decrease in delivery expenses resulting from a 22 decrease in the number of dvds mailed to members the decrease in shipments was driven by a decline in the number of dvd memberships coupled with a decrease in usage by these members other costs primarily those associated with processing and customer service expenses decreased 156 million primarily due to a decrease in hub operation expenses resulting from the decline in dvd shipments 

our domestic dvd segment had a contribution margin of 48  for the year ended december 31 2014 and was flat as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 

year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 



the decrease in our domestic dvd revenues was due to a 20 decrease in the average number of paid memberships 

the decrease in domestic dvd cost of revenues was primarily due to a 620 million decrease in content expenses and a 442 million decrease in delivery expenses resulting from a 19 decrease in the number of dvds mailed to members the decrease in shipments was driven by a decline in the number of dvd memberships other costs primarily those associated with content processing and customer service center expenses decreased 204 million primarily due to a decrease in hub operation expenses resulting from the decline in dvd shipments 

our domestic dvd segment had a contribution margin of 48  for the year ended december 31 2013 and was relatively flat as compared to the year ended december 31 2012

the increase in technology and development expenses was primarily due to an 874 million increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense resulting from an increase in compensation for existing employees and a 12 growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion 

  



the increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 428 million increase in personnelrelated costs these increases are primarily due to increases in employee compensation as well as an 8 growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and international expansion 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for corporate personnel as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses general and administrative expenses also include the gain on disposal of dvds 



general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a 706 million increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense resulting from a 37 increase in average headcount primarily to support our international expansion and an increase in compensation for existing employees in addition there was an 116 million increase in legal costs for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 



the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a 220 million increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from a 31 increase in average headcount to support our growth in addition expenses related to the use of outside and professional services taxes and insurance increased 89 million the increase in expenses was further impacted by an 80 million decrease in the gain on the disposal of dvds 

interest expense 

interest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding longterm debt obligations including the amortization of debt issuance costs as well as interest on our lease financing obligations 

  



interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014 consists primarily of 468 million of interest on our notes the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 is due to the higher aggregate principal of interest bearing notes outstanding 



interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 consists primarily of 261 million of interest on our 5375 notes the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 is due to the higher aggregate principal of interest bearing notes outstanding partially offset by their lower interest rate 

interest and other income expense 

interest and other income expense consists primarily of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances 



interest and other income expense was relatively flat as compared to the prior year losses on foreign currency denominated balances were 82 million and 84 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 



interest and other income expense decreased due to increased foreign exchange losses on foreign currency denominated balances the foreign exchange losses were 84 million and 40 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

extinguishment of debt 

in connection with the redemption of the outstanding 2000 million aggregate principal amount of the 850 notes we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 251 million in the year ended december 31 2013 which consisted of expenses associated with the redemption including a 194 million premium payment pursuant to the makewhole provision in the indenture governing the 850 notes for further detail see note 5 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

provision for income taxes 

in 2014 the difference between our 24 effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 397 million primarily due to the release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits of 386 million as a result of an irs appeals settlement for the tax years 20082009 leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years coupled with the retroactive reinstatement of the 2014 federal research and development rd credits partially offset by state income taxes foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 was primarily attributable to the 386 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits 

on december 19 2014 the tax increase prevention act of 2014 hr 5771 was signed into law which retroactively extended the federal rd credit from january 1 2014 through december 31 2014 as a result we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2014 federal rd credit of approximately 107 million as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2014 the period in which the legislation was enacted 



in 2013 the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 12 million primarily due to the federal and california rd credits partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible expenses the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily attributable to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 federal rd credit in january 2013 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 hr 8 was signed into law which retroactively extended the federal rd credit from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 as a result we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2012 federal rd credit of approximately 31 million as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2013 the period in which the legislation was enacted 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 16085 million and 12004 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively in february 2014 we issued 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 5750 senior notes due 2024 the 5750 notes in february 2013 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 5375 senior notes due 2021 the 5375 notes we used approximately 2245 million of the net proceeds of our 5375 notes to redeem our outstanding 850 notes including a 194 million makewhole premium and 51 million of accrued and unpaid interest in november 2011 we issued 2000 million of senior convertible notes the senior convertible notes consisted of 2000 million aggregate principal amount due on december 1 2018 and did not bear interest in april 2013 we exercised our option to cause the conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock see note 5  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

our primary uses of cash include content acquisition and licensing streaming delivery marketing programs and payroll payment terms for certain content agreements require more upfront cash payments relative to the expense and therefore future investments could impact our liquidity 

we expect to significantly increase our investments in international expansion and in streaming content particularly in original content as a result and to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment we plan to obtain at least 1 billion in longterm debt in the first quarter of 2015 our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

as of december 31 2014 1308 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2014 the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries for which we could be required to accrue and pay taxes is 292 million see note 10 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments and for certain other activities free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expense noncash stockbased compensation expense and other working capital differences the excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our 

content agreements and is expected to continue to be significant as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments such as original content agreements working capital differences include deferred revenue taxes and semiannual interest payments on our outstanding debt our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow 



cash provided by operating activities decreased 813 million primarily due to increased payments for content other than dvd library of 8351 million or 32 as well as increased payments associated with higher operating expenses the increased use of cash was partially offset by a 11301 million or 26 increase in revenues 

cash used in investing activities decreased 2131 million primarily due to a decrease of 2422 million in the purchases of shortterm investments net of proceeds from sales and maturities this decrease was offset by an increase of 156 million purchases of property and equipment 

cash provided by financing activities increased 654 million primarily due to the 3929 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5750 notes in the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the 4906 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5375 notes less the 2194 million redemption of our 850 notes in the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 563 million from the issuance of common stock including the impact of excess tax benefits 

free cash flow was 3935 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily due to 5342 million of content cash payments over expense partially offset by 1152 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense and 255 million of favorable other working capital differences 

free cash flow was 1287 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to 2279 million of content cash payments over expense and 453 million nonfavorable other working capital differences this was partially offset by 731 million noncash stockbased compensation expense 463 million in deferred revenue and 251 million loss on debt extinguishment the cash impact of which is a financing activity and therefore not included in free cash flow 



cash provided by operating activities increased 762 million primarily due to an increase in revenues of 7653 million   or 21 this increase was partially offset by increased payments for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 5026 million or 24 as well as increased payments associated with higher operating expenses operating activities were further impacted by increased payments for streaming delivery payment processing fees and customer service call centers due to our growing member base 

cash used in investing activities increased 112 million primarily due to an increase of 177 million in the acquisition of dvd content library and a 139 million increase in the purchase of property and equipment primarily due to investments in our streaming delivery network cash outflow was offset by a 232 million increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases 

cash provided by financing activities increased 4707 million in the first quarter of 2013 we issued 5000 million of 5375 notes with net proceeds of 4906 million after payment of debt issuance costs this was offset by the 2194 million redemption of our 850 senior notes financing activities were further impacted by 1976 million of increased cash flows provided by stock option exercises 

free cash flow was 753 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily due to 1439 million of content cash payments over expense and 53 million nonfavorable other working capital differences partially offset by 739 million noncash stockbased compensation expense 

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2014 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2014

obligations that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as they do not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition 

streaming content obligations increased 22 billion from 73 billion as of december 31 2013 to 95 billion as of december 31 2014 primarily due to multiyear commitments associated with our latest market launches in europe and the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming 

a streaming content obligation is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is generally recorded on the consolidated balance sheets certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity and  or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date because the amount is not reasonably estimable we do not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount however the unknown obligations are expected to be significant and the expected timing of payments could range from less than one year to more than five years traditional film output deals like the future output deal with disney or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown are examples of license agreements not included in the contractual obligations table once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees we include the amount in the streaming content obligations 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2014 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 348 million and an additional 04 million for gross interest and penalties classified as “other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets at this time we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us 

indemnifications 

the information set forth under note 7  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  under the caption “guarantees—indemnification obligations” is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

streaming content 

we license and acquire rights to stream tv shows movies and original content to members for unlimited viewing these rights are for a fixed fee and specify windows of availability payment terms for certain content agreements require more upfront cash payments relative to expense 

we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of liabilities when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming the portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “current content library net” and the remaining portion as “noncurrent content library net” on the consolidated balance sheets the acquisition of streaming content rights and the changes in related liabilities are classified within cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

we amortize the content library in “cost of revenues” on a straight line or on an accelerated basis as appropriate 

 

we review factors impacting the amortization of the content library including historical and estimated viewing patterns on a regular basis our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations 

the content library is stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value streaming content whether capitalized or not is reviewed in aggregate at the geographic region level for impairment when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content the level of geographic aggregation is determined based on the streaming content rights which are generally specific to a geographic region inclusive of several countries such as latin america no material write down from unamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented 

we have entered into certain licenses with performing rights organizations pros and are currently involved in negotiations with other pros that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works publicly performed in connection with streaming content into various territories accruals for estimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates these amounts are included in the streaming content obligations the results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from managements estimates 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more 

likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2014  our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 348 million of which 292 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates see note 10  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information regarding income taxes 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period 

we calculate the fair value of our stock option grants using a latticebinomial model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments debt and foreign currency fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in “accumulated other comprehensive loss income” within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 

for the year ended december 31 2014  we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2014  our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset backed securities 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as shortterm investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates as of december 31 2014 

  



a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2014  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as shortterm investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the analysis is shown as of december 31 2014  

  



  

based on investment positions as of december 31 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 59 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of december 31 2013 a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in an 86 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of december 31 2014 we had 9000 million of debt consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in two tranches 5000 million of 5375 notes due in 2021 and 4000 million of 5750 notes due in 2024 the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 

foreign currency risk 

we have foreign currency risk related to our revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro the british pound the canadian dollar and the brazilian real accordingly changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit loss of our international streaming segment as expressed in us dollars 

we also have foreign currency risk related to foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany balances denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on these foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities 

w e do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge any foreign currency exposures  the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy to date the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our international streaming segment contribution profit loss and consolidated net income have not been material however our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within netflix have been detected 

  

 our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control—integrated framework 2013 framework based on our assessment under the framework in internal control—integrated framework 2013 framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report that is included herein

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

business 

tableend about us 

netflix inc “netflix” “the company” “we” or “us” is the world’s leading internet television network with more than 44 million streaming members in over 40 countries enjoying more than one billion hours of tv shows and movies per month including original series our members can watch as much as they want anytime anywhere on nearly any internetconnected screen members can play pause and resume watching all without commercials or commitments additionally in the united states us our members can receive dvds delivered quickly to their homes 

we are a pioneer in the internet delivery of tv shows and movies launching our streaming service in 2007 since this launch we have developed an ecosystem for internetconnected devices and have licensed increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy tv shows and movies directly on their tvs computers and mobile devices as a result of these efforts we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of and interest in the delivery of tv shows and movies directly over the internet 

our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business domestically and internationally we are continuously improving our members experience  expanding our streaming content with a focus on programming an overall mix of content that delights our customers enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more internetconnected devices while staying within the parameters of our consolidated net income loss and operating segment contribution profit loss targets 

we continue to grow our streaming service both domestically and internationally we began our international expansion with canada in 2010 and have since launched our service in latin america and several european territories we anticipate a substantial expansion of our service in europe in late 2014 we have also expanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming including several emmy and golden globe nominated original series in 2013 

prior to july 2011 in the us our streaming and dvdbymail operations were combined and members could receive both streaming content and dvds under a single “hybrid” plan in july 2011 we separated the combined plans making it necessary for members who wish to receive both dvdsbymail and streaming content to have two separate membership plans 

business segments 

the company has three operating segments domestic streaming international streaming and domestic dvd the domestic and international streaming segments derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content the domestic dvd segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of dvdbymail for additional information regarding our segments including information about our financial results by geography see note 12  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

competition 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment video providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another our principal competitors vary by geographic region and include multichannel video programming distributors providing free on demand content through authenticated internet applications internetbased movie and tv content providers including both those that provide legal and illegal or pirated entertainment video content dvd rental outlets and kiosk services and entertainment video retail stores 

seasonality 

our member growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internetconnected devices and when they tend to increase their viewing our domestic member growth is generally greatest in our fourth and first quarters october through march slowing in our second quarter april through june and then accelerating in our third quarter july through september we expect each market in our international segment to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns additionally the variable expenses associated with shipments of dvds are highest in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of dvd usage 

intellectual property 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidential agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes

risk factors 

tableend 

if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant member growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with a valuable and quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members competitors include multichannel video programming distributors providing free on demand content through authenticated internet applications internetbased movie and tv content providers including both those that provide legal and illegal or pirated entertainment video content dvd rental outlets and kiosk services and entertainment video retail stores if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new or adjust existing features or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain members in addition many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing members if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful we may not be able to attract members and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected members cancel our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new members both to replace members who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current member base if too many of our members cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new members in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing members and attracting new members our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of members cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies and evolving business models for delivery of entertainment video continue to develop at a fast pace the growth of internetconnected devices including tvs computers and mobile devices has increased the consumer acceptance of internet delivery of entertainment video through these new and existing distribution channels consumers are afforded various means for consuming entertainment video the various economic models underlying these differing means of entertainment video delivery include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market several competitors have longer operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition and significant financial marketing and other resources they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing new entrants may enter the market with unique service offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video and other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content licenses may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operation 

in connection with obtaining streaming content we typically enter into multiyear licenses with studios and other content providers the payment terms of which are not tied to member usage or the size of our member base “fixed cost” but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipts such commitments are included in the contractual obligations section of item 7 managements discussion   and analysis of financial condition and results of operations given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content licenses if member acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be adversely impacted payment terms for streaming licenses especially programming that is initially available in the applicable territory on our service “original programming” or that is considered output content will typically require more upfront cash payments than other licensing agreements to the extent member andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content licensing commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain licenses in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content licenses may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our 

business and the market segments in which we operate as we expand internationally we must license content in advance of entering into a new geographical market if we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in the applicable territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our content licenses we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are expanding our operations internationally scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the us as we expand internationally we are managing our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and internet video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing services if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations our business may be adversely affected 

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve member satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain members and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we must continue to build and maintain strong brand identity we believe that strong brand identity will be important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video to build a strong brand we believe we must continue to offer content and service features that our members value and enjoy we also believe that these must be coupled with effective consumer communications such as marketing customer service and public relations if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected such a result coupled with the increasingly longterm and fixed cost nature of our content acquisition licenses may adversely affect our operating results 

with respect to our expansion into international markets we will also need to establish our brand and to the extent we are not successful our business in new markets may be adversely impacted 

changes in our member acquisition sources could adversely affect our marketing expenses and member levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs including social media sites such as facebook and twitter to promote our service to potential new members we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected 

if companies that currently promote our service decide that we are negatively impacting their business that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such marketing channels we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we face risks such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we produce license andor distribute through our service 

as a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we produce license andor distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service including marketing materials and features on our website such as member reviews as we expand our original programming we will become responsible for production costs and other expenses such as ongoing guild payments we will also take on risks associated with the production such as completion and key talent risk to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks or if we become liable for content we produce license andor distribute our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations we cannot assure that we are indemnified to cover claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if studios content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our members with content they can watch instantly depends on studios content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected andor our costs could increase many of the licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice as competition increases we may see the cost of programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content including original content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

music contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution in this regard we engage in negotiations with performing rights organizations and collection societies “pros” that hold certain rights to music interests when publicly performed or “communicated to the public” in connection with streaming content into various territories if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from distributing certain content which could adversely impact our business additionally pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain pros and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with pros or result in music publishers represented by certain pros to unilaterally withdraw rights and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs 

we rely upon a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices 

we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internetconnected devices including tvs digital video players game consoles and mobile devices we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our consumer electronics partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our members use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters terrorist attacks power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm these systems interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections from time to time we experience service interruptions and have voluntarily provided affected members with a credit during periods of extended outage service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members 

our servers and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions and periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data any attempt by hackers to disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and to date hackers have not had a material impact on our service 

or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix members over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty web hosting cloud computing or content delivery network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions could adversely impact the experience of our members 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services aws provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

if we experience difficulties with the operation and implementation of open connect our singlepurpose netflix content delivery network “cdn” our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

we have built and deployed a singlepurpose netflix content delivery network that we call open connect given our size and growth we believe it makes economic sense to have our own specialized cdn we will continue to work with commercial cdn partners but we believe that the vast majority of our streaming bits will ultimately be served by open connect to the extent internet service providers isps do not interconnect with open connect or if we experience difficulties in operating the open connect cdn service our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected failure to implement open connect could require us to engage thirdparty solutions to deliver our content to isps which could increase our costs and negatively affect our operating results 

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation and merchandising technology or develop user interfaces that maintain or increase member engagement with our service our business may suffer 

our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our members we also develop test and implement various user interfaces across multiple devices in an effort to maintain and increase member engagement with our service 

we are continually refining our recommendation and merchandising technology as well as our various user interfaces in an effort to improve the predictive accuracy of our tv show and movie recommendations and the usefulness of and engagement with our service by our members we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements or other thirdparty recommendation or merchandising technology or interfaces may become more popular with or useful to our members in addition we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation technology 

if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements thereto or otherwise improve our user interfaces our service may be less useful to our members such failures could lead to the following 

   

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to stream tv shows and movies and to manage other aspects of our operations and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we continually enhance or modify the technology used for our operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our members future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the streaming of tv shows and movies to our members in a timely and efficient manner andor the processing of dvds among our shipping centers our ability to retain existing members and to add new members may be impaired in addition if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly our ability to retain existing members and to add new members may be impaired also any harm to our members personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws impacting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business for example in late 2010 the federal communications commission fcc adopted socalled net neutrality rules intended in part to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks recently the us court of appeals for the district of columbia struck down the fcc’s net neutrality rules and it is currently uncertain how the fcc will respond to this decision to the extent network operators attempt to use this ruling to extract fees from us to deliver our traffic or otherwise engage in discriminatory practices our business could be adversely impacted as we expand internationally government regulation concerning the internet and in particular network neutrality may be nascent or nonexistent within such a regulatory environment coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted furthermore to the extent network operators were to create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success for example comcast exempted certain of its own internet video traffic eg streampix videos to the xbox 360 from a bandwidth cap that applies to all unaffiliated internet video traffic eg netflix videos to the xbox 360 while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted in international markets especially in latin america these same incentives apply however the consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our member data and our disclosure of member data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our members we collect and utilize data supplied by our members we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to use 

collected data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results as our business evolves and as we expand internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer information failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our member data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our members including names and billing data with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members data despite these measures we or our payment processing services could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members data in the event of such a breach current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members additionally we could face legal claims for such a breach the costs relating to any data breach could be material and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach for these reasons should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data occur our business could be adversely affected 

increases in payment processing fees changes to operating rules the acceptance of new types of payment methods or payment fraud could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our members pay for our membership services predominately using credit and debit cards together payment cards our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result of a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to rules regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods these rules regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we accept payment methods other than payment cards as our service continues to evolve and expand internationally we will likely continue to explore accepting various forms of payment which may have higher fees and costs than our currently accepted payment methods if more consumers utilize higher cost payment methods our payment costs could increase and our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

in addition we do not obtain signatures from members in connection with their use of payment methods to the extent we do not obtain members’ signatures we may be liable for fraudulent payment transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent payment methods are used to obtain service while we do have certain safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent payment transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent payment transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

if the market segment for online subscriptionbased entertainment video saturates our business will be adversely affected 

the market segment for online subscriptionbased entertainment video has grown significantly much of the increasing growth can be attributed to the ability of our members to stream tv shows and movies on their tvs computers and mobile devices as we face more competition in our market segment our rate of growth relative to overall growth in the segment may decline further a decline in our rate of growth could indicate that the market segment for online subscriptionbased entertainment video is beginning to saturate while we believe that this segment will continue to grow for the foreseeable future if this market segment were to saturate our business would be adversely affected 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these 

applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us 

most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that may be different from and incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 

 9 

 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

we have issued debt offerings and may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of december 31 2013 we had 500 million in 5375 senior notes risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 we plan to obtain approximately 400 million in long term debt in the first quarter of 2014 and it is possible that we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel which may be disruptive to our operations 

if memberships to our domestic dvd segment decline faster than anticipated our business could be adversely affected 

the number of memberships to our dvdbymail offering is declining and we anticipate that this decline will continue we believe however that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund losses arising from our growth internationally to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvdbymail business is greater than we anticipate our business could be adversely affected we do not anticipate increasing resources to our dvd operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved to the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our dvdbymail service members satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in dvdbymail member cancellations which could adversely impact our business 

changes in us postal rates or operations could adversely impact our operating results and member satisfaction 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our members increases in postage delivery rates including those resulting from changes to policies on the requirements of first class mail such as size weight or machinability could adversely affect our domestic dvd segments contribution profit if the us postal service were to implement other changes to improve its financial position such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our domestic dvd segments contribution profit could be adversely affected 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 11 

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues contribution margins net income and number of total and paid member additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

we are the world’s leading internet television network with more than 44 million streaming members in over 40 countries enjoying more than one billion hours of tv shows and movies per month including original series our members can watch as much as they want anytime anywhere on nearly any internetconnected screen members can play pause and resume watching all without commercials or commitments additionally in the united states us our members can receive dvds delivered quickly to their homes 

we are a pioneer in the internet delivery of tv shows and movies launching our streaming service in 2007 since this launch we have developed an ecosystem for internetconnected devices and have licensed increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy tv shows and movies directly on their tvs computers and mobile devices as a result of these efforts we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of and interest in the delivery of tv shows and movies directly over the internet historically our acquisition of new members has been seasonal with the first and fourth quarters representing our strongest net member additions and our second quarter representing the lowest net member additions in a calendar year 

our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business domestically and internationally we are continuously improving our members experience  expanding our streaming content with a focus on programming an overall mix of content that delights our customers enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more internetconnected devices while staying within the parameters of our consolidated net income loss and operating segment contribution profit loss targets 

results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights 



 consolidated revenues for 2013 increased as compared to prior years due to growth in international and domestic streaming memberships operating income and net income increased as compared to prior year by 1784 million and 953 million respectively due to the increase in revenue partially offset by an increase in the cost of revenues due to continued investments in existing and new streaming content 

free cash flow was 1287 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2013 the excess of net income over free cash flow has increased from 753 million and 396 million in the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the increases are primarily the result of increased investments in original content or content that is licensed in an earlier window through an output arrangement which will typically depending upon the terms require more upfront cash payments relative to the expense 

the following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations 

 

 18 

majority of cost of revenues streaming content rights are generally specific to a geographic region and accordingly our international expansion will require us to obtain additional streaming content licenses to support new international markets other cost of revenues such as content delivery expenses customer service and payment processing fees are lower as a percentage of total cost of revenues as compared to content licensing expenses we utilize both our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet content delivery expenses therefore also include equipment costs related to our streaming content delivery network open connect and all thirdparty costs associated with delivering streaming content over the internet cost of revenues in the domestic dvd segment consists primarily of content delivery expenses related to the acquisition of content including amortization of dvd content library and revenue sharing expenses and other expenses associated with our dvd processing and customer service centers content delivery expenses for the domestic dvd segment consist of the postage costs to mail dvds to and from our paying members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers 

 

 

 

2013 segment results 

domestic streaming segment 



in the domestic streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a membership plan our domestic streaming membership plans are priced primarily at 799 per month in 2013 we introduced membership plans priced at 1199 per month under which members can stream content on up to four devices concurrently new member additions and revenue related to 1199 membership plans were not material for the year ended december 31 2013 the 5665 million   increase  in our domestic streaming revenues was due to the 26 growth in the average number of paid memberships 

the 2903 million   increase  in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to the 2263 million increase in content licensing expenses resulting from continued investments in existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming in addition content delivery expenses increased by 310 million and other costs such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers increased 330 million due to our growing member base 

marketing expenses increased 225 million primarily due to an increase in advertising partially offset by a decrease in payments to affiliates in the us 

our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 23  for the year ended december 31 2013 which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 17  for the year ended december 31 2012 as a result of growing memberships and revenue faster than content and marketing spending 

international streaming segment 



in the international streaming segment we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a membership plan priced at the equivalent of usd 7 to 14 per month we launched our streaming service in canada in september 2010 and have continuously expanded our services internationally with launches in latin america in september 2011 the uk and ireland in january 2012 finland denmark sweden and norway in october 2012 and most recently the netherlands in september 2013 we plan to continue to expand our services internationally and expect a substantial european expansion in 2014 

the 4248 million   increase  in our international revenues was primarily due to the 134 growth in the average number of paid international memberships international streaming memberships account for 25 of total streaming memberships at the end of 2013 

the 2992 million   increase  in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a 2720 million increase in content licensing expenses this increase was primarily attributable to continued investments in existing and new streaming content including content to support the launch of our service in the nordics launched in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the netherlands launched in the third quarter of 2013 other costs increased 272 million due to increases in our content delivery expenses costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees all driven by our growing member base 

international marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 increased   109 million  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 due to our expansion in the nordics and the netherlands offset partially by a decrease in spending in other territories 

international contribution losses improved   1148 million  year over year as a result of growing memberships and revenues faster than content and marketing spending our international streaming segment does not benefit from the established member base that exists for the domestic segments as a result of having to build a member base from zero investments in streaming content and marketing programs for our international segment are larger initially relative to revenues in particular as new territories are launched the contribution losses for our international segment have been significant due to investments in streaming content and marketing programs to drive membership growth and viewing in our international markets 

domestic dvd segment 



in the domestic dvd segment we derive revenues from our dvdbymail membership services the price per plan for dvdbymail varies from 499 to 4399 per month according to the plan chosen by the member dvdbymail plans differ by the number of dvds that a member may have out at any given point members electing access to high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds pay a surcharge ranging from 2 to 4 per month for our most popular plans 

the 2261 million  decrease in our domestic dvd revenues was due to a 20 decrease in the average number of paid memberships 

the 1321 million  decrease in domestic dvd cost of revenues was primarily due to a 632 million decrease in content acquisition expenses and a 477 million decrease in content delivery expenses resulting from a 21 decrease in the number of dvds mailed to paying members the decrease in shipments was driven by a decline in the number of dvd memberships other costs primarily those associated with content processing and customer service center expenses decreased 212 million primarily due to a decrease in hub operation expenses resulting from the decline in dvd shipments 

our domestic dvd segment had a contribution margin of 48  for the year ended december 31 2013 and was relatively flat as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 

2012 segment results 

domestic segments 



prior to july 2011 in the us our streaming and dvdsbymail operations were combined and members could receive both streaming content and dvds under a single “hybrid” plan in july 2011 we introduced dvd only plans and separated the combined plans making it necessary for members who wish to receive both streaming services and dvdsbymail to have two separate membership plans as members were able to receive both streaming and dvdsbymail under a single hybrid plan prior to the fourth quarter of 2011 it is impracticable to allocate revenues and expenses to the domestic streaming and domestic dvd segments prior to the fourth quarter of 2011 

the 2000 million increase in our domestic revenues in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the 15 growth in the domestic average number of unique paying members driven by new streaming memberships this increase was offset in part by an 8 decline in domestic average monthly revenue per unique paying member resulting from the decline in dvd memberships 

the 2179 million increase in domestic cost of revenues in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to a 3977 million increase in content licensing expenses this increase was primarily attributable to continued investments in existing and new streaming content content delivery expenses decreased by 1620 million primarily due to a 41 decrease in the number of dvds mailed to paying members driven by a decline in the number of dvd memberships other costs associated with content processing and customer service center expenses decreased by 139 million primarily due to a decrease in hub operation expenses resulting from the declines in dvd shipments offset partially by increases in customer service center expenses to support our growth in domestic memberships 

marketing expenses decreased 385 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in marketing program spending in television radio and direct mail advertising partially offset by increases in online advertising 

the domestic segment had a contribution margin of 27 for the year ended december 31 2012 and is relatively flat as compared to december 31 2011 

international streaming segment 



the 2047 million increase in our international revenues in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the 260 growth in the international average number of unique paying members driven by a full year of service offering in latin america as well as our launches in the uk and ireland and nordic regions international streaming memberships account for 18 of total streaming memberships at the end of 2012 

international cost of revenues increased by 3681 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a 3475 million increase in content licensing costs resulting from the continued investments in streaming content available for viewing in canada and latin america and to support our launches in the uk and ireland and nordic regions 

international marketing expenses increased 1226 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in marketing program spending online and in television and radio advertising to support our launches in the uk and ireland and nordic regions 

consolidated operating expenses 

technology and development 

technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings including testing maintaining and modifying our user interface our recommendation merchandising and content delivery technology as well as our telecommunications systems and infrastructures technology and development expenses also include costs associated with computer hardware and software 

  



the 498 million  increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 428 million increase in personnelrelated costs these increases are primarily due to increases in employee compensation as well as an 8 growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and international expansion 



the 700 million  increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 634 million increase in personnelrelated costs including a 127 million increase in stockbased compensation these increases are primarily due to a 35 growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and international expansion 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for corporate personnel as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses general and administrative expenses also include the gain on disposal of dvds 

general and administrative expenses increased 413 million  primarily due to a 220 million increase in personnel related costs resulting from a 31 increase in average headcount to support our growth in addition expenses related to the use of outside and professional services taxes and insurance increased 89 million the increase in expenses was further impacted by an 80 million decrease in the gain on the disposal of dvds 

the 93 million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 90 million expense in 2011 related to the settlement of a legal claim related to our compliance with the video privacy protection act a 58 million increase in the gain on sale of previously viewed dvds and an 86 million decrease in miscellaneous expenses related to the use of outside and professional services taxes insurance costs and to costs associated with various legal claims against us these decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs of 141 million attributed to an 8 increase in average headcount 

interest expense 

interest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with outstanding longterm debt obligations including the amortization of debt issuance costs as well as interest on our lease financing obligations 

  



interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 consists primarily of 261 million of interest on our notes the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared the year ended december 31 2012 is due to the higher aggregate principal of interest bearing notes outstanding partially offset by the lower interest rate 



interest expense was relatively flat as compared to the prior year interest expense in 2012 consists primarily of 170 million of interest due on our 850 notes 

interest and other income expense 

interest and other income expense consists primarily of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances 



interest and other income expense decreased due to increased foreign exchange losses on foreign currency denominated balances the foreign exchange losses were 84 million and 40 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 



interest and other income expense decreased due to increased foreign exchange losses on foreign currency denominated balances the foreign exchange loss was 40 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and were immaterial for the year ended december 31 2011 

extinguishment of debt 

in connection with the redemption of the outstanding 2000 million aggregate principal amount of the 850 notes we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 251 million in the year ended december 31 2013 which consisted of expenses associated with the redemption including a 194 million premium payment pursuant to the makewhole provision in the indenture governing the 850 notes 

provision for income taxes 

in 2013 the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 12 million primarily due to the federal and california research and development rd credits partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible expenses the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily attributable to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 federal rd credit in january 2013 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 hr 8 was signed into law which retroactively extended the federal rd credit from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 as a result we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2012 federal rd credit of approximately 31 million as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2013 the period in which the legislation was enacted 



in 2012 the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35 was 27 million primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible expenses partially offset by the california rd credit the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily attributable to the expiration of the federal rd credit on december 31 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 12004 million and 7481 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively in february 2013 we issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 5375 senior notes due 2021 the 5375 notes we used approximately 2245 million of the net proceeds to redeem our outstanding 850 notes including a 194 million makewhole premium and 51 million of accrued and unpaid interest in november 2011 we issued 2000 million of senior convertible notes and raised an additional 2000 million through a public offering of common stock the senior convertible notes consisted of 2000 million aggregate principal amount due on december 1 2018 and did not bear interest in april 2013 we exercised our option to cause the conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock see note 5  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

our primary uses of cash include licensing of content content delivery marketing programs and payroll we expect to continue to make significant investments to license streaming content both domestically and internationally and will continue to expand our investments in original content in 2014 we expect to substantially increase our investment in original content though still representing less than 10 of our overall global content expense original content or content that is licensed in an earlier window through an output arrangement will typically depending upon the terms require more upfront cash payments relative to the expense and therefore future investments could impact our liquidity and result in a use of operating cash 

we expect to significantly increase our investments in international expansion including substantial expansion in europe in 2014 and in original content as a result and to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment we plan to obtain approximately 400 million in long term debt in the first quarter of 2014 our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

as of december 31 2013 558 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries see note 10 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

on june 11 2010 we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase 3000 million of our common stock through the end of 2012 under this plan we repurchased 2590 million at december 31 2012 this authorization expired and the remaining 410 million was not used 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments and for certain other activities free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expenses noncash stockbased compensation expense and other working capital differences which include deferred revenue taxes and semiannual interest payments on outstanding debt our receivables from members settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow for streaming content we typically enter into multiyear licenses with various content providers that may result in an increase in content library and a corresponding increase in liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the payment terms for these license fees may extend over the term of the license agreements which typically range from six months to five years 



cash provided by operating activities increased 762 million primarily due to an increase in revenues of 7653 million   or 21 this increase was partially offset by increased payments for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 5026 million or 24 as well as increased payments associated with higher operating expenses operating activities were further impacted by increased payments for streaming content delivery payment processing fees and customer service call centers due to our growing member base 

cash used in investing activities increased 112 million primarily due to an increase of 177 million in the acquisition of dvd content library and a 139 million increase in the purchase of property and equipment primarily due to investments in our streaming content delivery network cash outflow was offset by a 232 million increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments net of purchases 

cash provided by financing activities increased 4707 million in the first quarter of 2013 we issued 5000 million of 5375 notes with net proceeds of 4906 million after payment of debt issuance costs this was offset by the 2194 million redemption of our 850 senior notes financing activities were further impacted by 1976 million of increased cash flows provided by stock option exercises 

free cash flow was 1287 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to 2304 million of content cash payments over expense 294 million of tax impacts and 134 million nonfavorable other working capital differences this was partially offset by 731 million noncash stockbased compensation expense 463 million in deferred revenue and 251 million loss on debt extinguishment the cash impact of which is a financing activity and therefore not included in free cash flow 

free cash flow was 753 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily due to 1452 million of content cash payments over expense and 40 million nonfavorable other working capital differences partially offset by 739 million noncash stockbased compensation expense 



cash provided by operating activities decreased 2961 million primarily due to increased payments for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 7795 million or 59 partially offset by an increase in subscription revenues of 4047 million or 13 

cash used in investing activities decreased 211 million primarily due a 369 million decrease in the acquisition of dvd content library and a 94 million decrease in the purchase of property and equipment due to a decrease in purchases of automation equipment for our various shipping centers these decreases were partially offset by a 304 million increase in the purchases net of proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments 

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was 56 million primarily related to stock option activity cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 2617 million which consisted primarily of 1999 million of proceeds from the public offering of common stock and 1981 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt these proceeds were offset by 1997 million of stock repurchases 

free cash flow was 396 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to 1477 million of content cash payments over expense partially offset by 616 million noncash stockbased compensation expense and 465 million favorable other working capital differences 

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2013 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2013 

  



  

 at december 31 2012 the company had 56 billion of obligations comprised of 13 billion included in current content liabilities and 11 billion of noncurrent content liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and 32 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 

a streaming content obligation is incurred at the time we sign a license agreement to obtain future titles once a title becomes available a content liability is generally recorded on the consolidated balance sheet certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles the ultimate quantity and  or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date because the amount is not reasonably estimable we do not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount however the unknown obligations are expected to be significant and the expected timing of payments could range primarily from one year to more than five years 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2013 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 682 million and an additional 39 million for gross interest and penalties classified as “other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets at this time we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not engage into any transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

streaming content 

we license rights to stream tv shows movies and original content to members for unlimited viewing these licenses are for a fixed fee and specify license windows that generally range from six months to five years payment terms may extend over the license window or may require more upfront payments as is typically the case for original content or content that is licensed in an earlier window through an output arrangement 

we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of liabilities when the license period begins the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming the portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “current content library” and the remaining portion as “noncurrent content library” on the consolidated balance sheets the acquisition of streaming content licenses rights and the changes in related liabilities are classified within cash used in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

we amortize the content library in “cost of revenues” on a straight line or on an accelerated basis as appropriate 

 29 

amortization of the content library is determined based on our historical and estimated viewing patterns and requires considerable management judgment when we started with original content we did not have specific data about viewing patterns over time for content that premieres on netflix based on our experience with other similar television series and our initial estimates of viewing patterns we amortized content that exclusively premiered on our service on a straightline basis over the shorter of four years or the license period if a subsequent season is added we extend the remaining amortization period by a year current estimates of viewing patterns indicate that viewing in the first few months is significantly higher relative to the rest of the amortization period than previously estimated as a result in the third quarter of 2013 we began amortizing this type of content on an accelerated basis over the amortization period the effect of this change in estimate was a decrease in operating income and net income of 250 million and 154 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2013 any other changes in managements estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations 

the content library is stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value streaming content licenses whether capitalized or not are reviewed in aggregate at the geographic region level for impairment when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content the level of geographic aggregation is determined based on the streaming content rights which are generally specific to a geographic region inclusive of several countries such as latin america no material write down from unamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented 

we have entered into certain licenses with performing rights organizations pros and are currently involved in negotiations with other pros that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works publicly performed in connection with streaming content into various territories accruals for estimated royalties are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates these amounts are included in the streaming content obligations the results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from managements estimates 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2013  our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 682 million of which 570 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates see note 10  of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information regarding income taxes 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period 

we calculate the fair value of new stockbased compensation awards under our stock option plans using a latticebinomial model this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in “accumulated other comprehensive income” within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 

for the year ended december 31 2013  we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2013  our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as shortterm investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 

  



a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2013  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as shortterm investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the analysis is shown as of december 31 2013  

  



  

based on investment positions as of december 31 2013 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in an 86 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of december 31 2012 a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a 15 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

we have foreign currency risk related to our revenues and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro the british pound the canadian dollar and the brazilian real accordingly changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenue and net income as expressed in us dollars we also have foreign currency risk related to foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany balances denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on these foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities to date the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our revenues and net income have not been material the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within netflix have been detected 

  

 our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013  in making this assessment our

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders of netflix inc

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion netflix inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 based on the coso criteria

business 

tableend about us 

netflix inc “netflix” “the company” “we” or “us” is the world’s leading internet television network with more than 33 million members in over 40 countries enjoying more than one billion hours of tv shows and movies per month including original series for one low monthly price our members can watch as much as they want anytime anywhere on nearly any internetconnected screen additionally in the united states us our subscribers can receive standard definition dvds and their high definition successor bluray discs collectively referred to as “dvd” delivered quickly to their homes 

our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business domestically and internationally we are continuously improving the customer experience  expanding our streaming content with a focus on programming an overall mix of content that delights our customers including exclusive and original content enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more internetconnected devices while staying within the parameters of our consolidated net income loss and operating segment contribution profit loss targets contribution profit loss is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses 

we are a pioneer in the internet delivery of tv shows and movies launching our streaming service in 2007 since this launch we have developed an ecosystem for internetconnected devices and have licensed increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy tv shows and movies directly on their tvs computers and mobile devices as a result of these efforts we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of and interest in the delivery of tv shows and movies directly over the internet 

in september 2010 we began international operations by offering our streaming service in canada in the past two years we have continued our international expansion and now also offer our streaming service in latin america the united kingdom uk ireland and the nordic countries of finland denmark sweden and norway 

prior to july 2011 in the us our streaming and dvdbymail operations were combined and subscribers could receive both streaming content and dvds under a single “hybrid” plan in july 2011 we separated the combined plans making it necessary for subscribers who wish to receive both dvdsbymail and streaming content to have two separate subscription plans 

business segments 

beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011 the company has three operating segments domestic streaming international streaming and domestic dvd the domestic and international streaming segments derive revenues from monthly subscription services consisting solely of streaming content the domestic dvd segment derives revenues from monthly subscription services consisting solely of dvdbymail for additional information regarding our segments see note 10 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

domestic streaming 

the domestic streaming segment provides our more than 27 million members with access to a broad range of exclusive nonexclusive and original content delivered over the internet to a host of connected devices  including pcs and macs game consoles such as playstations smart tvs bluray players home theater systems internet video players such as apple tv and roku digital video recorders and mobile devices we have a leading market position in domestic streaming having grown by more than 5 million subscriptions in 2012  an increase of 25 from 2011 

international streaming 

the large numbers of pay television and broadband households outside the us provide our international streaming segment with a large longterm growth opportunity through significantly expanding our base of potential subscribers from our initial international market launch in canada in september 2010 our international streaming service has grown to be available in more than 40 countries outside of the us as of december 31 2012 we believe that international markets will be a significant source of growth and cash flow in the long term and as a result we are strategically investing internationally today our focus in international markets is to provide a compelling service offering to subscribers which allows us to gain market share in the near term we view longterm international success as consumer adoption and contribution margins at the levels of our domestic market 

domestic dvd 

our domestic dvd business launched in 1999 with dvdbymail subscription plans as technology has changed and consumer preference has shifted we have seen subscribers move away from dvd rental and toward streaming their video content 

competition 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment video providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another our principal competitors vary by geographic region and include

growth drivers 

our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business domestically and internationally and is built upon the following drivers 

investment in streaming content  we believe that our investments in streaming content lead to more subscriber viewing delight and positive consumer wordofmouth this in turn leads to subscriber acquisition and revenue growth which allows us to invest in more streaming content which enables the growth cycle to continue with more than 33 million global subscribers and our increasingly exclusive and original programming that differentiates us from competitors we believe we are well positioned to capitalize upon this virtuous cycle 

continuous service improvements  weve found that incremental improvements in our service and quality enhance our member satisfaction and retention we continue to refine our technology user interfaces and delivery infrastructure to improve the customer experience for example using our “adaptive streaming” technology we automatically and constantly optimize the streaming bitrate to each users internet speed this minimizes loading and buffering times delivering the best clickandwatch experience we have added programs in super hd and with dolby digital plus 51 surround sound for a high quality immersive entertainment experience we believe that improvements such as these will help us build a great streaming service 

overall adoption and growth of internet tv   domestically cable and satellite pay tv subscriber numbers have stagnated while dvr penetration has continued to climb we see this as indicative of consumers desiring more control and freedom in their ability to watch what they want when they want where they want and how they want we are leading this wave of consumer change and growth of internet tv by providing broad clickandwatch video entertainment video 

future of the consumer electronic ecosystem “internet on every screen”   we intend to broaden our already expansive partner relationships over time so that even more devices are capable of streaming content from netflix by making netflix accessible on a broad array of devices we believe that we enhance the value of our service to subscribers as well as position ourselves for continued growth as internet and mobile delivery of content becomes more popular we are pioneering the use of tablets and smartphones as secondscreen choosing devices for tv viewing and are actively engaged with all of our device partners in evaluating how netflix can enhance and improve the user experience in conjunction with their product innovations 

international market expansion   the international streaming segment represents a significant longterm growth opportunity as people around the world discover the benefits of netflix we plan to continue our international investment strategy of upfront investment in content and marketing to build out scale required for profitability we believe that scale advantages increase barriers to entry for our competitors today 18 of all of netflixs global streaming subscribers are outside of the us 

operations 

we obtain content from various content providers through streaming content license agreements dvd direct purchases and dvd revenue sharing agreements we market our service through various channels including online advertising broadbased media such as television and radio as well as various strategic partnerships in connection with marketing the service we offer freetrial memberships to new members rejoining members are an important source of subscriber additions we utilize the services of thirdparty cloud computing providers more specifically amazon web services and utilize both our own content delivery network open connect and thirdparty content delivery networks such as level 3 communications to help us efficiently stream content in high volume to our subscribers over the internet we also ship and receive dvds in the us from a nationwide network of shipping centers 

seasonality 

our subscriber growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internetconnected devices and when they tend to increase video watching our domestic subscriber growth is generally greatest in our fourth and first quarters october through march slowing in our second quarter april through june and then accelerating in our third quarter july through september we expect each market in our international segment to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns additionally the variable expenses associated with shipments of dvds are highest in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of dvd usage 

intellectual property 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidential agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had 2045 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our dvd fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments our use of temporary employees has decreased significantly due to decreased dvd shipments in 2012 as well as increased automation of our shipment centers as of december 31 2012 we had 384 parttime and temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant subscriber growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers competitors include multichannel video programming distributors mvpds with free tv everywhere and other on demand content internet movie and tv content providers including both those that provide legal and illegal or pirated entertainment video content dvd rental outlets and kiosk services and entertainment video retail stores if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new or adjust existing features or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers in addition many of our subscribers are rejoining our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract subscribers and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is unsatisfactory competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies and evolving business models for delivery of entertainment video continue to develop at a fast pace the growth of internetconnected devices including tvs computers and mobile devices has increased the consumer acceptance of internet delivery of entertainment video through these new and existing distribution channels consumers are afforded various means for consuming entertainment video the various economic models underlying these differing means of entertainment video delivery include subscription transactional adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market several competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing new entrants may enter the market with unique service offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video and other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

the increasingly longterm and fixed cost nature of our content acquisition licenses may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operation 

in connection with obtaining streaming content we typically enter into multiyear licenses with studios and other content providers the payment terms of which are not tied to subscriber usage or the size of our subscriber base “fixed cost” but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed andor theatrical exhibition receipt such contractual commitments are included in the contractual obligations section of item 7 managements discussion   and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed cost nature of content licenses if subscriber acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations our margins may be adversely impacted payment terms for streaming licenses especially programming that initially airs in the applicable territory on our service “original programming” or that is considered output content will typically require more upfront cash payments than other licensing agreements to the extent subscriber andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content licensing commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain licenses in addition the longterm and fixed cost nature of our streaming licenses may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our 

business and the market segments in which we operate    as we expand internationally we must license content in advance of entering into a new geographical market if we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in the applicable territory acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the longterm and fixed cost nature of our commitments we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted 

changes in consumer viewing habits including more widespread usage of tv everywhere or other similar on demand methods of entertainment video consumption could adversely affect our business 

the manner in which consumers view entertainment video is changing rapidly digital cable wireless and internet content providers are continuing to improve technologies content offerings user interface and business models that allow consumers to access on demand entertainment with interactive capabilities including start stop and rewind the devices through which entertainment video can be consumed are also changing rapidly today content from mvpds may be viewed on laptops and content from internet content providers may be viewed on tvs although we provide our own internetbased delivery of content allowing our subscribers to stream certain tv shows and movies to their internetconnected televisions and other devices if other providers of entertainment video address the changes in consumer viewing habits in a manner that is better able to meet content distributor and consumer needs and expectations our business could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are currently engaged in an effort to expand our operations internationally scale our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both subscribers and features related to our service as well as continue to operate our dvd service within the us as we expand internationally we are managing our business to address varied content offerings consumer customs and practices in particular those dealing with ecommerce and internet video as well as differing legal and regulatory environments as we scale our streaming service we are developing technology and utilizing relatively new thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing services we have also chosen to separate the technology that operates our dvdbymail service from that which runs our streaming operations if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including maintaining our dvd operations and improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations our business may be adversely affected 

if the market segment for online subscriptionbased entertainment video saturates our business will be adversely affected 

the market segment for online subscriptionbased entertainment video has grown significantly much of the increasing growth can be attributed to the ability of our subscribers to stream tv shows and movies on their tvs computers and mobile devices as we face more competition in our market segment our rate of growth relative to overall growth in the segment may decline further a decline in our rate of growth could indicate that the market segment for online subscriptionbased entertainment video is beginning to saturate while we believe that this segment will continue to grow for the foreseeable future if this market segment were to saturate our business would be adversely affected 

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we must continue to build and maintain strong brand identity we believe that strong brand identity will be important in attracting and retaining subscribers who may have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video to build a strong brand we believe we must continue to offer content and service features that our subscribers value and enjoy we also believe that these must be coupled with effective consumer communications such as marketing customer service and public relations if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected such a result coupled with the increasingly longterm and fixed cost nature of our content acquisition licenses may adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among other things our title selection pricing delivery speed and service interruptions furthermore thirdparty devices that enable instant streaming of tv shows and movies from netflix may not meet consumer expectations to the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected in 2011 we made a series of announcements regarding our business including the separation of our dvdbymail and streaming plans with a corresponding price change for some of our customers the rebranding of our dvdbymail service and the subsequent retraction of our plans to rebrand our dvdbymail service consumers reacted negatively to these announcements adversely impacting our brand and resulting in higher than expected customer cancellations which negatively affected our operating results while we have seen significant improvements to our brand since the events of 2011 we nonetheless believe that it will continue to take time to repair our brand to the levels we enjoyed prior to the events of 2011 

with respect to our expansion into international markets we will also need to establish our brand and to the extent we are not successful our business in new markets would be adversely impacted 

changes in our subscriber acquisition sources could adversely affect our marketing expenses and subscriber levels may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including paid search listings banner ads text links and permissionbased emails as well as our affiliate program we also engage our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including tv and radio advertising direct mail and print campaigns consumer package and mailing insertions we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership we maintain an active public relations program including through social media sites such as facebook and twitter to increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide that we are negatively impacting their business that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such marketing channels in addition if ad rates increase we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our marketing costs laws and regulations impose restrictions on or otherwise prohibit the use of certain acquisition channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such practices intrusive or damaging to our brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

if we become subject to liability for content that we distribute through our service our results of operations would be adversely affected 

as a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute we also may face potential liability for content used in member reviews if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations we cannot assure that we are indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims 

if studios and other content providers refuse to license streaming content to us upon acceptable terms our business could be adversely affected 

our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch instantly depends on studios and other content providers licensing us content specifically for internet delivery the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios and other content providers change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to license us content our ability to stream content to our subscribers will be adversely affected unlike dvd streaming content is not subject to the first sale doctrine as such we are completely dependent on the various content providers to license us content in order to access and stream content many of the licenses provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice in addition the studios and other content providers have great flexibility in licensing streaming content they may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming content for example hbo licenses content from studios like warner bros and the license provides hbo with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services including netflix as such netflix cannot license certain warner bros content for delivery to its subscribers while warner bros may nonetheless license the same content on a transactional basis conversely content providers may license the same content to multiple subscriptionbased services and may do so on different terms and conditions as such netflix and its competitors may offer consumers many of the same content titles but license these at different rates as competition increases we may see the cost for programming increase as we seek to differentiate our service we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner within this context we are selective about the titles we add and renew our service if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content our subscriber acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us including on an exclusive basis in some cases our ability to stream tv shows and movies to our subscribers will be adversely impacted and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be adversely impacted 

we rely upon a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices 

we currently offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their pcs macs and other internetconnected devices including bluray players and tvs digital video players game consoles and mobile devices we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our consumer electronics partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our subscribers use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

if subscriptions to our domestic dvd segment decline faster than anticipated our business could be adversely affected 

the number of subscriptions to our dvdbymail offering is declining and we anticipate that this decline will continue we believe however that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business in addition we believe that dvd will be a valuable consumer proposition and studio profit center for the next several years even as dvd sales decline the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund losses arising from our growth internationally to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvdbymail business is greater than we anticipate our business could be adversely affected because we are primarily focused on building a global streaming service the resources allocated to maintaining dvd operations and the level of management focus on our dvd business are limited we do not anticipate increasing resources to our dvd operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved to the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our dvdbymail service subscribers satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in dvdbymail subscriber cancellations which could adversely impact our business 

if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected 

under us copyright law once a dvd is sold into the market those obtaining the dvd are permitted to resell it rent it or otherwise dispose of it this is commonly referred to as the first sale doctrine while the vast majority of our dvd content acquisitions are direct from content providers the first sale doctrine provides us with an option to acquire content from other third parties should the content providers refuse to deal with us on acceptable terms if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine our ability to obtain dvd content and then rent it could be adversely affected 

increased availability of new releases to other distribution channels prior to or on parity with the release on dvd andor the delayed availability of such dvds through our service could adversely affect our business 

over the past several years we have seen content providers adjust and experiment with the various distribution channels and content release timing further our licensing agreements with several studios require that we do not rent new release dvds until some period of time after such dvds are first made available for retail sale these shifting distribution channels their associated timing andor the delayed availability of such dvds through our service may negatively impact subscribers perception of value in our service which could adversely affect our business moreover if we are unable to negotiate favorable terms to acquire dvds our contribution profits may be adversely affected 

any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of thirdparties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of thirdparties that we utilize in our operations interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill 

dvd selections from time to time we experience service interruptions and have voluntarily provided affected subscribers with a credit during periods of extended outage service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

our servers and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions and periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data any attempt by hackers to disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and to date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operation 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize our own and thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet problems faced by us or our thirdparty web hosting cloud computing or content delivery network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers in addition fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services aws provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon competes with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

if we experience difficulties with the operation and implementation of open connect our singlepurpose netflix content delivery network “cdn” our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted 

in addition to generalpurpose commercial cdns we have enabled internet service providers isps to obtain our streaming content from open connect a singlepurpose netflix content delivery network that we have established given our size and growth we believe it makes economic sense to have our own specialized cdn we will continue to work with our commercial cdn partners for the next few years but eventually we expect the vast majority of our streaming bits will be served by open connect open connect will provide the netflix bits at no cost to the locations the isp desires or isps can choose to get the netflix bits at common internet exchanges to the extent isps do not interconnect with open connect or if we experience difficulties in operating the open connect cdn service our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our subscribers could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected failure to implement open connect could require us to engage thirdparty solutions to deliver our content to isps which could increase our costs and negatively affect our operating results 

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation and merchandising technology or develop user interfaces that maintain or increase subscriber engagement with our service our business may suffer 

our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers we also develop test and implement various user interfaces across multiple devices in an effort to maintain and increase subscriber engagement with our service 

we are continually refining our recommendation and merchandising technology as well as our various user interfaces in an effort to improve the predictive accuracy of our tv show and movie recommendations and the usefulness of and engagement with our service by our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements or other third party recommendation or merchandising technology or interfaces may become more popular with or useful to our subscribers in addition we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation technology 

if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements thereto or otherwise improve our user interfaces our service may be less useful to our subscribers such failures could lead to the following 

   

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to stream tv shows and movies and to manage other aspects of our operations and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we continually enhance or modify the technology used for our operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the streaming of tv shows and movies to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner andor the processing of dvds among our shipping centers our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired in addition if our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired also any harm to our subscribers personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in us postal rates or operations could adversely impact our operating results and subscriber satisfaction 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our domestic dvd segments contribution profit the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on january 23 2013 to 46 cents it is expected that the us postal service will raise rates again in subsequent years which would result in increased shipping costs if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds and our contribution margin could be adversely affected for example the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia recently instructed the postal regulatory commission prc to remedy discrimination by the postal service in the processing of dvds by mail or to explain adequately why such discrimination is reasonable while we do not anticipate any material impact to our operations arising from this case if the prc institutes a remedy that results in an increase in postage rates or changes the manner in which our dvd shipments are processed our contribution margin could be adversely affected if the us postal service were to implement other changes to improve its financial position such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws limiting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business for example in late 2010 the federal communications commission adopted socalled net neutrality rules intended in part to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks the rules are currently subject to legal challenge to the extent that these rules are interpreted to enable network operators to engage in discriminatory practices or are overturned by legal challenge our business could be adversely impacted as we expand internationally government regulation concerning the internet and in particular network neutrality may be nascent or nonexistent within 

such a regulatory environment coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted for example in late 2010 comcast informed level 3 communications that it would require level 3 to pay for the ability to access comcasts network given that much of the traffic being requested by comcast customers is netflix streaming content stored with level 3 many commentators have looked to this situation as an example of comcast either discriminating against netflix traffic or trying to increase netflixs operating costs furthermore to the extent network operators were to create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such companies like comcast time warner cable and cablevision have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success for example comcast exempted certain of its own internet video traffic eg streampix videos to the xbox 360 from a bandwidth cap that applies to all unaffiliated internet video traffic eg netflix videos to the xbox 360while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices our business could be negatively impacted in international markets especially in latin america these same incentives apply however the consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and our disclosure of subscriber data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our subscribers we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to use collected data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if we were to disclose data about our subscribers in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results as our business evolves and as we expand internationally we may become subject to additional andor more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer information failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations we could incur additional expenses 

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our subscriber data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our subscribers including names and in many cases mailing addresses with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers data if despite these measures we or our payment processing services experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers we could face legal claims and our business could be adversely affected similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

in addition we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit and debit cards together “payment cards” by them under current payment card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders signatures we are liable for fraudulent payment card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent payment cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory and streaming typically these payment cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from 

these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

increases in payment processing fees changes to operating rules or the acceptance of new types of payment methods could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using payment cards our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result of a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to rules regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods these rules regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we accept payment methods other than payment cards as our service continues to evolve and expand internationally we will likely continue to explore accepting various forms of payment which may have higher fees and costs than our currently accepted payment methods if more consumers utilize higher cost payment methods our payment costs could increase and our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents or trademarks issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

  if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service 

the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations could be adversely affected 

our executive offices and certain data centers are located in the san francisco bay area we have dvd shipping centers located throughout the us including earthquake and hurricanesensitive areas our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of these natural disasters as well as from electrical blackouts fires floods power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our dvd fulfillment and delivery operations to handle disruptions in service arising from these events because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our executive offices and data centers we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes and may not have adequate insurance to cover losses and expenses from other natural disasters 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us 

most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

we offer our streaming plan in canada latin america and certain countries in europe the uk ireland finland denmark sweden and norway operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that may be different from and incremental to those in the us in addition to the risks that we face in the us our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 

 13 

 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

we have issued debt offerings and may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of december 31 2012 we had 200 million in 850 senior notes and 200 million in zero coupon senior convertible notes outstanding we also anticipate closing an offering of 500 million in 5375 senior notes a portion of the proceeds of which will be used to redeem our 85 senior notes risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel which may be disruptive to our operations 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 14 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

on november 2 2012 we implemented a stockholder rights plan also called a poison pill which may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control of us by among other things making it uneconomical for a thirdparty to acquire us on a hostile basis 

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction 

a small number of our stockholders could significantly influence our business 

as of december 31 2012 we believe that our top five stockholders control approximately 41 of our common stock these few significant stockholders either individually or acting together may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of the company or our assets this concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other stockholders to effect substantial changes in the company may have the effect of delaying preventing or expediting as the case may be a change in control of the company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in addition involvement of certain activist stockholders may impact our ability to recruit and retain talent or otherwise distract management further the interests of these few stockholders may not be in the best interests of all stockholders 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues contribution margins net income and number of total and paid subscriber additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

we are the world’s leading internet television network with more than 33 million members in over 40 countries enjoying more than one billion hours of tv shows and movies per month including original series for one low monthly price our members can watch as much as they want anytime anywhere on nearly any internetconnected screen additionally in the us our subscribers can receive standard definition dvds and their high definition successor bluray discs collectively referred to as “dvd” delivered quickly to their homes 

we are a pioneer in the internet delivery of tv shows and movies launching our streaming service in 2007 since this launch we have developed an ecosystem for internetconnected devices and have licensed increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy tv shows and movies directly on their tvs computers and mobile devices as a result of these efforts we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of and interest in the delivery of tv shows and movies directly over the internet historically our acquisition of new subscriptions has been seasonal with the first and fourth quarters representing our strongest net subscription additions and our second quarter representing the lowest net subscription additions in a calendar year 

results of operations 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights for the years ended december 31 



 consolidated revenues for 2012 increased as compared to prior years due to growth in streaming subscriptions operating income and net income in 2012 both declined as compared to prior year reflective of increases in both cost of revenues due to streaming content investments and marketing to support our launch into new international markets 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 2447 million as compared to 2011 to negative 582 million significant uses of cash in the year were cash payments for content in excess of the expense and cash payments related to income taxes these uses of cash were partially offset by net income excluding the impact of noncash stock compensation and deferred revenue we expect excess content payments over expense to continue to fluctuate over time both domestically and internationally payment terms for certain streaming licenses especially programming that initially airs in the 

applicable territory on our service “original programming” or that is considered output content will typically require more upfront cash payments than other licensing agreements due to the expected receipt timing of original programming content content cash payments in excess of expense and free cash flow will be materially more negative in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 but free cash flow is expected to improve in subsequent quarters 

prior to july 2011 in the us our streaming and dvdsbymail operations were combined and subscribers could receive both streaming content and dvds under a single “hybrid” plan in july 2011 we introduced dvd only plans and separated the combined plans making it necessary for subscribers who wish to receive both streaming services and dvdsbymail to have two separate subscription plans as subscribers were able to receive both streaming and dvdsbymail under a single hybrid plan prior to the fourth quarter of 2011 it is impracticable to allocate revenues and expenses to the domestic streaming and domestic dvd segments prior to the fourth quarter of 2011 

our core strategy is to grow a streaming subscription business domestically and internationally we are continuously improving the customer experience with a focus on expanding our streaming content enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more internetconnected devices while staying within the parameters of our consolidated net income loss and operating segment contribution profit loss targets as we grow our streaming subscription segments we have shifted spending away from the domestic dvd segment to invest more in streaming content and marketing our streaming services 

 

 

 

 

domestic segments 



2012 domestic segment results 

revenues 

in the domestic streaming segment we derive revenues from services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a subscription plan priced at 799 per month in the domestic dvd segment we derive revenues from our dvdsbymail subscription services the price per plan for dvdsbymail varies from 499 to 4399 per month based on the number of dvds that a subscriber may have out at any given point customers electing access to high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds pay a surcharge ranging from 2 to 4 per month for our most popular plans 

the 2000 million increase in our domestic revenues in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the 15 growth in the domestic average number of unique paying subscribers driven by new streaming subscriptions this increase was offset in part by an 8 decline in domestic average monthly revenue per unique paying subscriber resulting from the decline in dvd subscriptions we expect streaming subscriptions domestically to continue to grow while dvd subscription declines continue to moderate 

cost of revenues 

the 2179 million increase in domestic cost of revenues in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the following factors 

 

 

 

marketing 

marketing expenses decreased 407 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in marketing program spending in television radio and direct mail advertising partially offset by increases in online advertising 

contribution profit 

our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 16 for 2012 and our domestic dvd segment had a contribution margin of 47 the domestic segments collectively had a contribution margin of 27 in 2012 down slightly from 28 in 2011 with the decrease driven primarily by investments in our streaming content we expect contribution margins for the domestic dvd segment to decline sequentially due to a seasonal increase in usage in the first quarter of 2013 and the expected usps rate increase of 001 each way which takes effect in january 2013 contribution margins for the domestic streaming segment are expected to expand as investments in domestic content and marketing grow slower than domestic streaming revenues and contribution profit may exceed the domestic dvd contribution profit in the first quarter of 2013 

          

2011 domestic segment results 

revenues 

the 9627 million increase in our domestic revenues in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to the 49 growth in the domestic average number of unique paying subscribers driven by new streaming subscriptions this increase was offset in part by a 3 decline in domestic average monthly revenue per unique paying subscriber resulting from the popularity of the streaming subscription plans introduced in november 2010 and a decline in the percentage of unique paying subscribers electing both a streaming and a dvd subscription following the pricing changes announced in july 2011 

cost of revenues 

the 5819 million increase in domestic cost of revenues in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to the following factors 

 

marketing 

marketing expenses increased 392 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in marketing program spending in television radio and online advertising coupled with an increase in payments to our affiliates these increases were partially offset by a decrease in direct mail and inserts and payments made to our consumer electronic partners the increase in marketing program spending was partially offset by decreases in the costs of free trials 

international streaming segment 



2012 international streaming segment results 

revenues 

in the international streaming segment we derive revenues from services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a subscription plan priced at approximately the equivalent of usd 800 per month in september 2010 we began international operations in canada we expanded to latin america in september 2011 and the uk and ireland in january 2012 in october 2012 we launched our streaming service in finland denmark sweden and norway 

the 2047 million increase in our international revenues in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the 260 growth in the international average number of unique paying subscribers driven by a full year of service offering in latin america as well as our launches in the uk and ireland and nordic regions international streaming subscriptions account for 18 of total streaming subscriptions at the end of 2012 we expect international streaming subscriptions to continue to grow 

cost of revenues 

international cost of revenues increased by 3681 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a 3475 million increase in content licensing costs resulting from the continued investments in streaming content available for viewing in canada and latin america and to support our launches in the uk and ireland and nordic regions 

marketing 

marketing expenses incurred by our international streaming segment have been significant and will fluctuate dependent upon the number of international territories in which our streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories 

international marketing expenses increased 1228 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to increases in marketing program spending online and in television and radio advertising to support our launches in the uk and ireland and nordic regions 

contribution loss 

 our international streaming segment does not benefit from the established subscriber base that exists for the domestic segments as a result of having to build a member base from zero investments in streaming content and marketing for our international segment are larger initially relative to revenues in particular as new territories are launched the contribution losses for our international segment have been significant and increased due to increased investments in streaming content and marketing programs to drive more membership growth and viewing in existing and new markets we expect a sequential improvement in international contribution loss in the first quarter of 2013 with more modest sequential improvements expected in subsequent quarters however contribution losses will continue to be significant as we expand internationally  

2011 international streaming segment results 



revenues 

the 792 million increase in our international revenues in 2011 as compared to 2010 reflects a full year of service offering in canada as well as our launch in latin america 

cost of revenues 

international cost of revenues increased by 1007 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase of 901 million in content licensing costs resulting from the continued investments in streaming content available for viewing in canada and to support our launch in latin america 

marketing 

international marketing expenses increased 696 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in marketing program spending in television and online to support our launch in latin america 

consolidated operating expenses 

technology and development 

technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offering including testing maintaining and modifying our user interface our recommendation merchandising and content delivery technology as well as our telecommunications systems and infrastructures technology and development expenses also include costs associated with computer hardware and software 

  



the 700 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 634 million increase in personnelrelated costs including a 127 million increase in stockbased compensation these increases are primarily due to a 35 growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and international expansion 

  



the 957 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of an 830 million increase in personnelrelated costs including an 187 million increase in stockbased compensation expense these increases are primarily due to a 54 growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and international expansion 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses general and administrative expenses also include the gain on disposal of dvds 

  



the 73 million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 90 million expense in 2011 related to the settlement of a legal claim related to our compliance with the video privacy protection act a 58 million increase in the gain on sale of previously viewed dvds and a 86 million decrease in miscellaneous expenses related to the use of outside and professional services taxes insurance costs and to costs associated with various legal claims against us these decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs of 161 million attributed to an 11 increase in average headcount and a 35 million increase in stockbased compensation we expect legal costs to continue at a high level for the foreseeable future as we defend claims against us 

  

the 625 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 336 million attributed to an 115 million increase in stockbased compensation and a 32 increase in average headcount legal costs increased 156 million primarily due to the 90 million settlement of a legal claim related to our compliance with the video privacy protection act and due to legal fees associated with various other claims against us other miscellaneous expenses primarily related to the use of outside and professional services taxes and insurance increased by 133 million 

interest expense

interest expense was relatively flat as compared to the prior year interest expense in 2012 consists primarily of 170 million of interest due on our 850 notes 

  



interest expense was relatively flat as compared to the prior year interest expense in 2011 consists primarily of 170 million of interest due on our 850 notes 

provision for income taxes 

  



in 2012 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 by 27 million primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible expenses partially offset by the california research and development rd credit the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 was 

primarily attributable to the expiration of the federal rd credit on december 31 2011 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 hr 8 was signed into law which retroactively extends the federal rd credit from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 as a result we will recognize the retroactive benefit of the 2012 federal rd credit of approximately 31 million as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2013 the period in which the legislation including the reinstatement was enacted 

  



in 2011 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to state income taxes of 150 million or 42 of income before income tax this was partially offset by the expiration of a statute of limitations for years 1997 through 2007 resulting in a discrete benefit of 35 million in the third quarter of 2011 and federal and california rd credits of 51 million the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 was attributable to the discrete benefit of 35 million higher rd tax credits and a lower effective tax rate for california 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 7481 million and 7978 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively our primary uses of cash include the acquisition and licensing of content content delivery expenses marketing and payroll related expenses we expect to continue to make significant investments to license streaming content both domestically and internationally and expect to obtain more original programs in 2013 these investments will impact our liquidity and we expect to have negative operating cash flows andor use of cash in future periods 

on january 29 2013 we announced the pricing of an offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5375 senior notes due 2021 the 5375 notes we expect the sale of the 5375 notes to close on february 1 2013 and we intend to use approximately 225 million of the net proceeds to redeem our 850 notes although we currently anticipate that the remaining proceeds from the 5375 notes together with our available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may be required or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance current and projected compliance with our debt covenants and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

in november 2011 we issued 2000 million of senior convertible notes the convertible notes and raised an additional 2000 million through a public offering of common stock the convertible notes consist of 2000 million aggregate principal amount due on december 1 2018 and do not bear interest we intend to exercise our option to cause the conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock if the specified conditions are satisfied including that the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock is equal or greater than 11154  for at least 50  trading days during a 65  trading day period prior to the conversion date 

in november 2009 we issued 2000 million of our 850 senior notes due november 15 2017 the “850 notes” interest on the 850 notes is payable semiannually at a rate of 850 per annum on may 15 and november 15 of each year commencing on may 15 2010 see note 4 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

as of december 31 2012 425 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on a portion of these funds when repatriated back to the us see note 8 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional details 

on june 11 2010 we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase 3000 million of our common stock through the end of 2012 under this plan we repurchased 2590 million at december 31 2012 this authorization expired and the remaining 410 million was not used 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments and for certain other activities free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in comparing free cash flow to net income the major recurring differences are excess content payments over expenses stockbased compensation expense deferred revenue taxes and semiannual interest payments on the 850 notes our receivables from customers settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow for streaming content we typically enter into multiyear licenses with various content providers that may result in an increase in content library and a corresponding increase in liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the payment terms for these license fees may extend over the term of the license agreements which typically range from six months to five years 

the following highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

  



cash provided by operating activities decreased 2949 million primarily due to increased payments for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 7795 million or 59 partially offset by an increase in subscription revenues of 4047 million or 13 

cash used in investing activities decreased 199 million primarily due a 369 million decrease in the acquisition of dvd content library and an 82 million decrease in the purchase of property and equipment due to a decrease in purchases of automation equipment for our various shipping centers these decreases were partially offset by a 304 million increase in the purchases net of proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments

free cash flow decreased 2447 million primarily due to a decrease of 1966 million in net income as adjusted for the increase in noncash stockbased compensation of 124 million as well as to a 286 million increase in excess tax payments over tax provision and 341 million increase related to the timing of various accruals this was partially offset by a 130 million decrease in excess property and equipment payments over depreciation expense content payments increased 7426 million while content expenses increased 7452 million 



cash provided by operating activities increased 413 million primarily due to an increase subscription revenues of 10420 million or 48 this increase was partially offset by increased payments for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 7663 million or 138 operating cash flows were further impacted by increases in payroll expenses and payments for advertising and affiliates transactions 

cash used in investing activities increased 1497 million primarily due to a 1640 million increase in the purchases net of proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments in addition purchases of property and equipment increased 158 million primarily due to purchases of automation equipment for our various dvd shipping centers these increases were partially offset by a 387 million decrease in acquisition of dvd content library

free cash flow increased 555 million primarily due to an increase of 989 million in net income as adjusted for the increase in noncash stockbased compensation of 336 million and decreased tax prepayments of 202 million this was partially offset by an increase in excess content payments over expenses of 532 million a 129 million increase in excess property and equipment payments over expense and decreased deferred revenues of 55 million payments for content increased 7276 million while content expenses increased 6744 million 

contractual obligations 

for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2012 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2012 

  



  

   

for those agreements with variable terms we do not estimate what the total obligation may be beyond any minimum quantities andor pricing as of the reporting date for those agreements that include renewal provisions that are solely at the option of the content provider we include the commitments associated with the renewal period to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified for these reasons the amounts presented in the table may not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows 

we have entered into certain streaming content license agreements that include an unspecified or a maximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future andor that include pricing contingent upon certain variables such as theatrical exhibition receipts for the title as of the reporting date it is unknown whether we will receive access to these titles or what the ultimate price per title will be accordingly such amounts are not reflected in the above contractual obligations table however such amounts are expected to be significant and the expected timing of payments for these commitments could range from less than one year to more than five years 

 

 

operating lease obligations include other facilities under noncancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company entered into a facilities lease agreement to expand its los gatos headquarters to a nearby site the ten year lease term will commence after the construction of the buildings is complete future minimum lease payments associated with this lease are 634 million as of december 31 2012 and are included in the operating lease obligations line in the above table 

 

as of december 31 2012 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 433 million and an additional 31 million for gross interest and penalties at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business the company does not engage into any transactions with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities whereby the company has financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

streaming content accounting 

we obtain content distribution rights in order to stream tv shows movies original programming to subscribers’ tvs computers and mobile devices streaming content is generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement which may have multiple windows of availability the license agreement may or may not be recognized in content library 

when the streaming license fee is known or reasonably determinable for a specific title and the specific title is first available for streaming to subscribers the title is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as “current content library net” for the portion available for streaming within one year and as “noncurrent content library net” for the remaining portion new titles recognized in the content library are classified in the line item “additions to streaming content library” within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows the streaming content library is reported at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value we amortize the content library on a straightline basis over each title’s contractual window of availability which typically ranges from six months to five years 

the amortization of the streaming content library is classified in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item “amortization of streaming content library” within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows costs related to subtitles dubbing and closed captioning are capitalized in current content library net on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the window of availability payment terms for these license fees may extend over the term of the license window which typically ranges from six months to five years for the titles recognized in content library the license fees due but not paid are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as current content liabilities for the amounts due within one year and as “noncurrent content liabilities” for the amounts due beyond one year changes in these liabilities are classified in the line item “change in streaming content liabilities” within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows we record the streaming content library assets and their related liability on our consolidated balance sheets at the gross amount of the liability payments for the titles not yet available for streaming are not yet recognized in the content library but in prepaid content minimum commitments for the titles not yet available for streaming are not yet recognized in the content library and are included in note 5 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

when the streaming license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title the title does not meet the criteria for asset recognition in the content library titles do not meet the criteria for asset recognition in the content library because the underlying license agreement does not specify the number of titles or the license fee per title or the windows of availability per title so that the license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title typical payment terms for these agreements which can range from three to five years require us to make equal fixed payments at the beginning of each quarter of the license term to the extent that cumulative payments exceed cumulative amortization prepaid content is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets we amortize the license fees on a straightline basis over the term of each license 

agreement the amortization is classified in “cost of revenues” on the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item “net income” within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows changes in prepaid content are classified within net cash provided by operating activities in the line item “prepaid content” on the consolidated statements of cash flows commitments for licenses that do not meet the criteria for asset recognition in the content library are included in note 5 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

          streaming content licenses including both those that are recorded in the streaming content library and those that do not meet the criteria for asset recognition are reviewed in aggregate at the geographic region level for impairment when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content the level of geographic aggregation is determined based on the streaming content rights which are generally specific to a geographic region inclusive of several countries such as latin america an impairment would be recorded as necessary to adjust the streaming content library to the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value no material write down from unamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented 

we have licenses with performing rights organizations pros and are currently involved in negotiations with other pros that hold certain rights to music publicly performed in connection with streaming content into various territories for the latter we accrue for estimated royalties that are expected to be due to pros and adjust these accruals based on any changes in estimates these amounts are included in our streaming content obligations if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with the pros we could become involved in litigation andor could be enjoined from delivering certain musical compositions which could adversely impact us additionally pending and ongoing litigation between certain pros and other third parties in various territories could impact our negotiations with pros while we anticipate finalizing these negotiations the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain the results of any negotiation may be materially different from management’s estimates 

income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2012 our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 433 million of which 357 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates see note 8 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information regarding income taxes 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period 

we calculate the fair value of new stockbased compensation awards under our stock option plans using a lattice 

binomial model we use a blackscholes model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares these models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in “accumulated other comprehensive income” within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2012 our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as shortterm investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 

  



a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2012 the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

the following table presents the hypothetical fair values in  thousands of our debt securities classified as shortterm investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the 

analysis is shown as of december 31 2012

 item 1 business tableend about us 

netflix inc “netflix” “the company” “we” or “us” is the world’s leading internet subscription service for enjoying tv shows and movies our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited tv shows and movies streamed over the internet to their tvs computers and mobile devices and in the united states our subscribers can receive standard definition dvds and their high definition successor bluray discs collectively referred to as “dvd” delivered quickly to their homes 

our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business domestically and globally we are continuously improving the customer experience with a focus on expanding our streaming content enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more internetconnected devices while staying within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment contribution profit targets in the past we have focused on operating margin targets going forward we will be operating within the parameters of contribution profit targets for each of our operating segments contribution profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenues and marketing expenses 

we are a pioneer in the internet delivery of tv shows and movies launching our streaming service in 2007 since this launch we have developed an ecosystem of internetconnected devices and have licensed increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy tv shows and movies directly on their tvs computers and mobile devices as a result of these efforts we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of and interest in the delivery of tv shows and movies directly over the internet we believe that the dvd portion of our domestic service will be a fading differentiator to our streaming success 

prior to july 2011 in the united states our streaming and dvdbymail operations were combined and subscribers could receive both streaming content and dvds under a single “hybrid” plan in july 2011 we introduced dvd only plans and separated the combined plans making it necessary for subscribers who wish to receive both dvdsbymail and streaming content to have two separate subscription plans this resulted in a price increase for our members who were taking a combination of our unlimited dvdsbymail and unlimited streaming services we made a subsequent announcement during the third quarter of 2011 concerning the rebranding of our dvdbymail service and the separation of the dvdbymail and streaming websites the consumer reaction to the price change and to a lesser degree the branding announcement was very negative leading to significant customer cancellations we subsequently retracted our plans to rebrand our dvdbymail service and separate the dvdbymail and streaming websites 

  

in september 2010 we began international operations by offering our streaming service in canada in september 2011 we expanded our streaming service to latin america and the caribbean in january 2012 we launched our streaming service in the uk and ireland we anticipate significant contribution losses in the international streaming segment in 2012 until we reach our goal of global profitability we do not intend to launch additional international markets 

competition 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment video providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another our principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

 operations 

we obtain content from various studios and other content providers through streaming content license agreements dvd direct purchases and dvd revenue sharing agreements we market our service through various channels including online advertising broadbased media such as television and radio as well as various strategic partnerships in connection with marketing the service we offer freetrial memberships to new members rejoining members are an important source of subscriber additions we utilize the services of thirdparty cloud computing providers more specifically amazon web services as well as content delivery networks such as level 3 communications to help us efficiently stream tv shows and movies we also ship and receive dvds in the united states from a nationwide network of shipping centers 

segments 

beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011 the company has three operating segments domestic streaming international streaming and domestic dvd the domestic and international streaming segments derive revenue from monthly subscription services consisting solely of streaming content the domestic dvd segment derives revenue from monthly subscription services consisting solely of dvdbymail for additional information regarding our segments see note 10 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

seasonality 

our subscriber growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations in when consumers buy internetconnected devices and when they tend to increase video watching as a consequence subscriber growth is generally greatest in our fourth and first quarters october through march slowing in our second quarter april through june and then accelerating in our third quarter july through september additionally the variable expenses associated with shipments of dvds are impacted by the seasonal nature of dvd usage 

intellectual property 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success we use a combination of 

  

patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidential agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had 2348 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our dvd fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments our use of temporary employees has decreased significantly due to decreased dvd shipments in 2011 as well as increased automation of our shipment centers as of december 31 2011 we had 579 parttime and temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors tableend if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant subscriber growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers competitors include mvpds with free tv everywhere and vod content internet movie and tv content providers including both those that provide legal and illegal or pirated entertainment video content dvd rental outlets and kiosk services and entertainment video retail stores if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new or adjust existing services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract subscribers in addition many of our subscribers are rejoining our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract subscribers and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is limited dvd delivery takes too long competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies and evolving business models for delivery of entertainment video continue to develop at a fast pace the growth of internetconnected devices including tvs computers and mobile devices has increased the consumer acceptance of internet delivery of entertainment video through these new and existing distribution channels consumers are afforded various means for consuming entertainment video the various economic models underlying these differing means of entertainment video delivery include subscription payperview adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market several competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing new entrants may enter the market with unique service offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video and other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

if we are unable to continue to recover from the negative consumer reaction to our price change and other announcements made during the third quarter of 2011 our business will be adversely affected 

in the third quarter of 2011 we made a series of announcements regarding our business including the separation of our unlimited dvdbymail and unlimited streaming plans with a corresponding price change for some of our customers the rebranding of our dvdbymail service and the subsequent retraction of our plans to rebrand our dvdbymail service consumers reacted negatively to these announcements adversely impacting our brand and resulting in higher than expected customer cancellations these adverse effects coupled with the increasingly longterm and fixedcost nature of our content acquisition licenses will likely continue to have an adverse impact on our results of operations while we have seen a return to growth in our core domestic streaming segment we believe the process of repairing our brand will take time if we are unable to continue to repair the damage to our brand our results of operations including cash flow will be adversely affected 

changes in consumer viewing habits including more widespread usage of tv everywhere vod or other similar on demand methods of entertainment video consumption could adversely affect our business 

the manner in which consumers view entertainment video is changing rapidly digital cable wireless and internet content providers are continuing to improve technologies content offerings user interface and business models that allow consumers to access entertainment videoondemand with interactive capabilities including start stop and rewind the devices through which entertainment video can be consumed are also changing rapidly today content from cable service providers may be viewed on laptops and content from internet content providers may be viewed on tvs although we provide our own internetbased delivery of content allowing our subscribers to stream certain tv shows and movies to their internetconnected televisions and other devices if other providers of entertainment video address the changes in consumer viewing habits in a manner that is better able to meet content distributor and consumer needs and expectations our business could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be adversely affected 

we are currently engaged in an effort to expand our operations internationally grow our streaming service with new content and across more devices as well as continue to operate our dvd service within the united states many of our systems and operational practices were implemented when we were at a smaller scale of operations and we are undertaking efforts to migrate the vast majority of our systems other than dvdrelated to cloudbased processors as we undertake all these changes if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our systems and operational practices our business may be adversely affected 

if the market segment for consumer paid commercial free internet streaming of tv shows and movies saturates our business will be adversely affected 

the market segment for consumer paid commercial free internet streaming of tv shows and movies has grown significantly much of the increasing growth can be attributed to the ability of our subscribers to stream tv shows and movies on their tvs computers and mobile devices a decline in our rate of growth could indicate that the market segment for online subscriptionbased entertainment video is beginning to saturate while we believe that this segment will continue to grow for the foreseeable future if this market segment were to saturate our business would be adversely affected 

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we must continue to build and maintain strong brand identity we believe that strong brand identity will be important in attracting subscribers who may have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video 

  

if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected from time to time our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among other things our title availability inventory allocation delivery processing and service interruptions furthermore thirdparty devices that enable instant streaming of tv shows and movies from netflix may not meet consumer expectations to the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected with respect to our planned international expansion we will also need to establish our brand and to the extent we are not successful our business in new markets would be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including paid search listings banner ads text links and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program we also engage our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including tv and radio advertising direct mail and print campaigns consumer package and mailing insertions we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership we maintain an active public relations program to increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide that we are negatively impacting their business that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such marketing channels in addition if ad rates increase we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our marketing costs laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of email and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

the increasingly longterm and fixedcost nature of our content acquisition licenses may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in connection with obtaining content particularly for streaming content we typically enter into multiyear fixedfee licenses with studios and other distributors such contractual commitments are detailed in the contractual obligations section of item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  furthermore we plan on increasing the level of committed content licensing in anticipation of our service and subscriber base growing to the extent subscriber andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of these content licensing commitments and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate could be limited 

  

if we become subject to liability for content that we distribute through our service our results of operations would be adversely affected 

as a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations we cannot assure that we are insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us 

if studios and other content distributors refuse to license streaming content to us upon acceptable terms our business could be adversely affected 

streaming content over the internet involves the licensing of rights which are separate from and independent of the rights we acquire when obtaining dvd content our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch instantly therefore depends on studios and other content distributors licensing us content specifically for internet delivery the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios and other content distributors change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to license us content our ability to stream content to our subscribers will be adversely affected unlike dvd streaming content is not subject to the first sale doctrine as such we are completely dependent on the studio or other content distributor to license us content in order to access and stream content many of the licenses provide for the studios or other content distributor to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice in addition the studios and other content distributors have great flexibility in licensing content they may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming content for example hbo licenses content from studios like warner bros and the license provides hbo with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services including netflix as such netflix cannot license certain warner bros content for delivery to its subscribers while warner bros may nonetheless license the same content to transactional vod providers if we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us our ability to stream tv shows and movies to our subscribers will be adversely impacted and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be adversely impacted as streaming content license agreements expire we must renegotiate new terms which may not be favorable to us if this happens the cost of obtaining content could increase and our margins may be adversely affected as we grow we are able to spend an increasingly larger amount for the licensing of streaming content we believe that the streaming content we make available to our subscribers is sufficiently diversified such that we will not be forced to pay licensing fees for content in excess of our desired contribution profit targets we believe that any failure to secure content will manifest in lower subscriber acquisition and retention and not in materially reduced margins given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed nature of content licenses if we do not experience subscriber acquisition and retention as forecasted our margins may be impacted by these fixed content licensing costs for example as a result of events over the past several months we have experienced slower growth than anticipated and our margins have been negatively impacted during the course of our license relationship various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and other content distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted 

we rely upon a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices 

we currently offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their pcs macs and other internetconnected devices including bluray players and tvs digital video players game consoles and mobile devices we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our consumer electronics partners are 

  

typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our subscribers’ use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

if subscriptions to our domestic dvd segment decline faster than anticipated our business could be adversely affected 

the number of subscriptions to our dvdbymail offering declined significantly following our price change we anticipate that this decline will continue we believe however that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business in addition we believe that dvd will be a valuable consumer proposition and studio profit center for the next several years even as dvd sales decline the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund losses arising from our growth internationally to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvdbymail business is greater than we anticipate our business could be adversely affected because we are primarily focused on building a global streaming service the resources allocated to maintaining dvd operations and the level of management focus on our dvd business are limited to the extent that we experience degradation in service in our dvdbymail business subscribers’ satisfaction with our service could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in cancellations which could adversely impact our business 

if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine or if studios were to release or distribute titles on dvd in a manner that attempts to circumvent or limit the effects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected 

under us copyright law once a copyright owner sells a copy of his work the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy while the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work the copyright owner gives up his ability to control the fate of the work once it had been sold as such once a dvd is sold into the market those obtaining the dvd are permitted to resell it rent it or otherwise dispose of it if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine our ability to obtain content and then rent it could be adversely affected by way of example the court of appeals for the 9th circuit has ruled that the first sale doctrine did not apply to sales of software that contained contractual limitations on resales to the extent such a ruling were extended to dvd sales our ability to obtain content for subsequent rental could be adversely impacted likewise if content providers agree to limit the sale or distribution of their content in ways that try to limit the effects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected for example we have entered into agreements with several studios to delay the availability of new release dvds for rental for a period of time following the dvds release to the retail market and in connection therewith these studios have prohibited certain of their wholesalers from selling dvds to us prior to such availability furthermore certain content owners from time to time have established exclusive rental windows with particular outlets this happened in late 2006 and again in late 2007 when blockbuster announced arrangements with certain content owners pursuant to which blockbuster would receive content on dvds for rental exclusively by blockbuster to the extent content is to be distributed exclusively and not to retail vendors or distributors we could be prevented from obtaining such content and those of our competitors who access such content could enjoy a corresponding competitive advantage to the extent the content is also sold to retail vendors or distributors under current law we would not be prohibited from obtaining and renting such content pursuant to the first sale doctrine nonetheless to the extent content owners do not distribute to us directly or through their wholesalers or otherwise establish exclusive rental windows it will impact our ability to obtain such content in the most efficient manner and in some cases in 

  

sufficient quantity to satisfy demand if such arrangements were to become more commonplace or if additional impediments to obtaining content were created our ability to obtain content could be impacted and our business could be adversely affected 

increased availability of new releases to other distribution channels prior to or on parity with the release on dvd coupled with delayed availability of such dvds through our service could adversely affect our business 

dvds currently enjoy a competitive advantage over certain other distribution channels such as payperview and some types of vod distribution because of the early distribution window on the dvd format the window for new releases on dvd is generally exclusive against and earlier than certain other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview regular “nonpremium” vod svod premium pay tv and other forms of tv exploitation the length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel are determined solely by the studio releasing the title over the past several years we have seen distributors adjust and experiment with the traditional distribution channels and timing for example certain other forms of nontheatrical distribution have been developed for certain new movie releases resulting in their nontheatrical availability prior to and during the dvd window in addition the major studios have shortened certain release windows andor have increasingly made new release movies available on vod simultaneously or prior to the release on dvd eg via “premium vod” and in a limited number of instances simultaneously with theatrical release if other distribution channels were to receive priority over or parity with the dvd window coupled with delayed availability of such dvd through our service subscriber’s perception of value in our service could decrease and our business could be adversely affected further as these distribution channels shift our relative position to them either in dvd or streaming may impact our subscribers’ perception of or value in our service and our business could be adversely affected 

delayed availability of new release dvds for rental could adversely affect our business 

our licensing agreements with several studios require that we do not rent new release dvds until some period of time after such dvds are first made available for retail sale these agreements provide us with less expensive content as well as deeper copy depth than we might otherwise have absent the delay thus improving both our business and consumer experience while several competitors have used the delayed availability of dvd content through our service to differentiate their own services we do not believe that this delayed availability has materially impacted our subscriber growth or satisfaction nonetheless it is possible that the delay in obtaining new release content could impact consumer perception of our service or otherwise negatively impact subscriber satisfaction furthermore in january 2012 warner home entertainment announced it was increasing the period of delay to fiftysix days if other studios were to increase the period of delay and or if our subscriber satisfaction is negatively impacted by this increase in the warner delay our business could be adversely impacted 

we could be subject to increased costs arising from our acquisition of dvd content and our subscribers’ demand for dvd titles that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

we obtain dvds through a mix of revenue sharing agreements and direct purchases the type of agreement we utilize to acquire dvd content depends on the economic terms we can negotiate as well as studio preferences if we are unable to negotiate favorable terms to acquire the dvds our contribution profits may be adversely affected furthermore during the course of our agreements various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted direct purchase of dvds requires us to be able to accurately forecast demand in order to ensure that we have enough copies of a title to satisfy but not exceed demand so that our subscriber satisfaction is not negatively impacted however if we purchase excess copies of title or experience an increase in usage of a title without a corresponding increase in subscriber retention and growth our content and fulfillment costs will increase disproportionately to revenues thus adversely affecting our operating results our content costs as a percentage of revenues can also increase if our 

  

subscribers select titles that were acquired under more expensive revenue share arrangements more often than they select other titles acquired through direct purchase or lower cost revenue share arrangements 

any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of thirdparties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business 

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site or their tvs computers game consoles or mobile devices our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of thirdparties that we utilize in our operations interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general including discriminatory network management practices could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections from time to time we experience service interruptions and have voluntarily provided affected subscribers with a credit during periods of extended outage much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

our servers and those of thirdparties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our insurance does not cover expenses related to attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our service or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations we also utilize thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet problems faced by our thirdparty web hosting cloud computing or content delivery network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers in addition fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services or aws provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the vast majority of our computing on aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon may compete with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

  

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation and merchandising technology or develop user interfaces that maintain or increase subscriber engagement with our service our business may suffer 

our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers we also develop test and implement various user interfaces across multiple devices in an effort to maintain and increase subscriber engagement with our service 

we are continually refining our recommendation and merchandising technology as well as our various user interfaces in an effort to improve the predictive accuracy of our tv show and movie recommendations and the usefulness of and engagement with our service by our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements in addition we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation technology 

if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements thereto or otherwise improve our user interfaces our service may be less useful to our subscribers such failures could lead to the following 

 

  

  

 we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to stream tv shows and movies and to manage other aspects of our operations including processing delivery and return of our dvds to our subscribers and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we continually enhance or modify the technology used for our operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the streaming of tv shows and movies to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner andor the processing of dvds among our shipping centers our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired in addition if our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired also any harm to our subscribers’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather natural disasters labor activism health epidemics or bioterrorism our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage and theft during our processing of shipments as well as during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage and theft rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

  

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect the contribution profit of our domestic dvd segment 

increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our domestic dvd segment’s contribution profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on may 12 2008 to 42 cents on may 11 2009 to 44 cents and again on january 22 2012 to 45 cents it is expected that the us postal service will raise rates again in subsequent years in accordance with the powers given the us postal service in connection with the 2007 postal reform legislation the us postal service continues to focus on plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds and our gross margin could be adversely affected for example the office of inspector general “oig” at the us postal service issued a report in november 2007 recommending that the us postal service revise the machinability qualifications for first class mail related to dvds or to charge dvd mailers who don’t comply with the new regulations a 17 cent surcharge on all mail deemed unmachinable in addition a bymail game rental company filed a complaint with the postal regulatory commission alleging that the us postal service unreasonably discriminated against it in favor of netflix and blockbuster to the extent this proceeding was to result in operational or regulatory changes impacting our mail processing our domestic dvd segment’s contribution profit and business operations could be adversely affected for example the us postal service recently announced changes to its service that would close many of its mail processing facilities and eliminate next day service for first class mail if such changes result in slower delivery of our dvds or otherwise lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws limiting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business for example in late 2010 the federal communications commission adopted socalled net neutrality rules intended in part to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks the rules are currently subject to legal challenge to the extent that these rules are interpreted to enable network operators to engage in discriminatory practices or are overturned by legal challenge our business could be adversely impacted as we expand internationally government regulation concerning the internet and in particular network neutrality may be nascent or nonexistent within such a regulatory environment coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted for example in late 2010 comcast informed level 3 communications that it would require level 3 to pay for the ability to access comcast’s network given that much of the traffic being requested by comcast customers is netflix data stored with level 3 many 

  

commentators have looked to this situation as an example of comcast either discriminating against netflix traffic or trying to increase netflix’s operating costs furthermore to the extent network operators were to create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such companies like comcast time warner cable and cablevision have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours our business could be negatively impacted in international markets especially in latin america these same incentives apply however the consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and our disclosure of or unauthorized access to subscriber data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our subscribers we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to use collected data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if unauthorized access to our subscriber data were to occur or if we were to disclose data about our subscribers in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results 

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our subscriber data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our subscribers including names and in many cases mailing addresses with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data if despite these measures we or our payment processing services experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers we could face legal claims and our business could be adversely affected similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

in addition we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory and streaming typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

  

increases in payment processing fees or changes to operating rules would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit cards our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to rules regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods which are predominately credit cards and debit cards these rules regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and thirdparties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and from time to time we expect to file for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved thirdparties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us thirdparties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of thirdparties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time thirdparties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

  

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent thirdparties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations could be adversely affected 

our executive offices and data centers are located in the san francisco bay area we have shipping centers located throughout the united states including earthquake and hurricanesensitive areas our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of these natural disasters as well as from electrical blackouts fires floods power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations to handle disruptions in service arising from these events because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our executive offices and data centers we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes and may not have adequate insurance to cover losses and expenses from other natural disasters 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us 

most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

we offer an unlimited streaming plan in canada latin america and beginning in early 2012 we expanded our streaming service offering to the uk and ireland operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from and incremental to those in the united states in addition to the risks that we face in the united states our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities for example in the fourth quarter of 2011 we raised 400 million of additional capital through the sale of 200 million worth of convertible notes in a private placement and 200 million worth of equity through a public offering the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

we have issued 400 million in debt offerings and may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of december 31 2011 we have 200 million in 850 senior notes and 200 million in zero coupon senior convertible notes outstanding risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

  

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet certain covenants the failure to comply with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses any failure to comply with the restrictions of any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements 

we may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees 

we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and cofounder reed hastings members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees in our industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel which may be disruptive to our operations 

risks related to our stock ownership 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

  

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues contribution margins net income and number of total and paid subscriber additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are the world’s leading internet subscription service for enjoying tv shows and movies our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited tv shows and movies streamed over the internet to their tvs computers and mobile devices and in the united states our subscribers can receive standard definition dvds and their high definition successor bluray discs collectively referred to as “dvd” delivered quickly to their homes 

our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business domestically and globally we are continuously improving the customer experience with a focus on expanding our streaming content enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to even more internetconnected devices while staying within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment contribution profit targets in the past we have focused on operating margin targets going forward we will be operating within the parameters of contribution profit targets for each of our operating segments contribution profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenues and marketing expenses 

we are a pioneer in the internet delivery of tv shows and movies launching our streaming service in 2007 since this launch we have developed an ecosystem of internetconnected devices and have licensed increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy tv shows and movies directly on their tvs computers and mobile devices as a result of these efforts we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of and interest in the delivery of tv shows and movies directly over the internet we believe that the dvd portion of our domestic service will be a fading differentiator to our streaming success 

prior to july 2011 in the united states our streaming and dvdbymail operations were combined and subscribers could receive both streaming content and dvds under a single “hybrid” plan in july 2011 we introduced dvd only plans and separated the combined plans making it necessary for subscribers who wish to receive both dvdsbymail and streaming content to have two separate subscription plans this resulted in a price increase for our members who were taking a combination of our unlimited dvdsbymail and unlimited streaming services we made a subsequent announcement during the third quarter of 2011 concerning the rebranding of our dvdbymail service and the separation of the dvdbymail and streaming websites the consumer reaction to the price change and to a lesser degree the branding announcement was very negative leading to significant customer cancellations we subsequently retracted our plans to rebrand our dvdbymail service and separate the dvdbymail and streaming websites 

in september 2010 we began international operations by offering our streaming service in canada in september 2011 we expanded our streaming service to latin america and the caribbean in january 2012 we launched our streaming service in the uk and ireland we anticipate significant contribution losses in the international streaming segment in 2012 until we reach our goal of global profitability we do not intend to launch additional international markets 

  

as a result of the changes to our pricing and plan structure we no longer offer a single subscription plan including both dvdbymail and streaming in the us domestic subscribers who wish to receive dvdsbymail and watch streaming content must elect both a dvdbymail subscription plan and a streaming subscription plan accordingly beginning with the third quarter of 2011 management views the number of paid subscriptions as the key driver of revenues the following metrics reflect these changes 

 

  

  as we evolve our focus from our dvd to streaming service we will be slightly changing how we treat our domestic subscribers so that they are in line with our international subscribers beginning in the first quarter of 2012 domestic members who are on payment holds will no longer be counted as unique subscribers nor will they be included in our subscription metrics members who cancel midperiod will continue to receive service until the end of the period and will accordingly be counted as subscribers and in our subscription metrics until the end of the period these changes may impact our subscription metrics but we do not expect such impacts to be material there is no effect on revenue from these changes 

the following represents our consolidated performance highlights for 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

   

due to the announcement of changes to our domestic plan offerings pricing and branding in the third quarter of 2011 we experienced an increase in the number of subscriber cancellations resulting in a net loss of unique domestic subscribers in the third quarter of 2011 however unique domestic subscribers returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2011 driven by the continued popularity of domestic streaming subscriptions the subscriber cancellations in the second half of 2011 coupled with slower growth in the number of new subscribers joining our service resulted in a 323 decrease in unique domestic net subscriber additions for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the yearoveryear increase in ending unique domestic subscribers was the primary driver in the 482 increase in consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

domestic streaming subscriptions increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2011 when we first began tracking such subscriptions separately due to strength in both acquisitions and retention we expect continued growth in this segment our contribution margin target for domestic streaming is 11 for the first quarter of 2012 with further margin expansion over the next twelve months 

in 2011 our international streaming segment reported a contribution loss of 1031 million and we expect that our expansion to the uk and ireland in january 2012 will result in further contribution losses as our investments to build our business there especially our investments in content licensing will exceed the revenues we are likely to generate 

dvd subscriptions which we also began tracking separately in the second half of 2011 are declining as subscribers migrate from hybrid plans towards lower priced streaming only subscription plans we expect continued decreases in dvd subscriptions which will reduce domestic and consolidated revenues by approximately the same amount of the increase expected from streaming subscription growth domestic dvd contribution margins are expected to remain healthy due to the primarily variable cost model and mature state of the business 

consolidated revenues for the first quarter of 2012 are expected to be flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and we may experience slower growth in consolidated revenue for the year ending december 31 2012 as compared to the year ending december 31 2011 as a result of the negative impact on revenue growth associated with a decline in domestic dvd subscriptions coupled with the increasing investment in our international streaming segment we expect to incur consolidated net losses for the year ended december 31 2012 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2011 increased as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 to 1866 million free cash flow was 396 million lower than net income of 2261 million largely due to the excess streaming and dvd content payments over expense the excess streaming and dvd content payments over expense will continue to fluctuate over time based on new content licenses domestically and internationally we expect that free cash flow in future periods will be negatively impacted by our expected consolidated net losses and that we may use cash in 2012 

as a result of the expected net losses and potential use of cash in 2012 we decided to strengthen our balance sheet by raising 400 million of additional capital in november 2011 we issued 2000 million of our zero coupon senior convertible notes due in 2018 the “convertible notes” and raised an additional 2000 million through a public offering of common stock 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 revenues 

we derive our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably over each subscriber’s monthly subscription period we currently generate substantially all of our revenues in the united states 

in the domestic streaming segment we derive revenues from services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a subscription plan priced at 799 per month in the domestic dvd segment we derive revenues from our dvdsbymail subscription services the price per plan for dvdsbymail varies from 799 to 4399 per month based on the number of dvds that a subscriber may have out at any given point customers electing access to high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds pay a surcharge ranging from 2 to 4 per month for our most popular plans 

in july 2011 in the united states we introduced dvd only plans and separated unlimited dvdsbymail and unlimited streaming making it necessary for subscribers who opt to receive both dvdsbymail and streaming to have two separate subscription plans as subscribers were able to receive both streaming and dvdsbymail under a single hybrid plan prior to the fourth quarter of 2011 it is impracticable to allocate revenues to the domestic streaming and domestic dvd segments prior to the fourth quarter of 2011 

in the international streaming segment we derive revenues from services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a subscription plan priced at approximately the equivalent of usd799 per month in september 2010 we began international operations in canada we expanded to latin america and the caribbean 

  

in september 2011 and the uk and ireland in january 2012 until we reach our goal of global profitability we do not intend to launch additional international markets 

 

 the 10420 million increase in our consolidated revenues was primarily due to the 446 growth in domestic revenues with the increase in international revenues contributing to 76 of the increase yearoveryear domestic revenues increased 9627 million as a result of the 491 growth in the domestic average number of unique paying subscribers driven by new streaming subscriptions this increase was offset in part by a 30 decline in domestic average monthly revenue per unique paying subscriber resulting from the popularity of the unlimited streaming subscription introduced in november 2010 and a decline in the percentage of unique paying subscribers electing both a streaming and a dvd subscription following the pricing changes in the second half of 2011 during the year ended december 31 2011 736 of our new gross domestic unique subscribers chose only an unlimited streaming plan which is priced at 799 per month and we expect that this percentage will grow in future periods at december 31 2011 889 of our total domestic unique subscribers had a streaming subscription while less than half 111 million had a dvd subscription 

international revenues increased by 792 million reflecting a full year of service offering in canada as well as our launch in latin america and the caribbean 

 

 the 4924 million increase in our consolidated revenues was primarily a result of the 409 growth in the domestic average number of unique paying subscribers arising from the continuous improvement to our customer experience which in turn drove consumer awareness of our service benefits this increase was offset in part by an 83 decline in the domestic average monthly revenue per unique paying subscriber resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans in the fourth quarter of 2010 when we introduced the unlimited streaming plan over onethird of new subscribers elected this option 

we expect the streaming subscription plans offered both domestically and internationally to continue to grow as a percentage of our total subscriber base we expect that as a result of the increase in subscriber cancellations and migration of our subscribers towards streaming subscription plans and lower priced dvdbymail subscription plans offset by increases in international revenues consolidated revenues will be relatively flat in the first quarter of 2012 and will increase at a modest pace sequentially in future quarters 

  

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues consists of cost of subscription revenues and fulfillment expenses 

cost of subscription revenues consists of expenses related to the acquisition and licensing of content as well as content delivery costs related to providing streaming content and shipping dvds to subscribers costs related to freetrial periods are allocated to marketing expenses 

content acquisition and licensing expenses consist primarily of amortization of streaming content licenses which may or may not be recognized in the streaming content library as well as amortization of dvd content library and revenue sharing expenses we obtain content through streaming content license agreements dvd direct purchases and dvd revenue sharing agreements with studios distributors and other suppliers content agreements are made in the ordinary course of business and our business is not substantially dependent on any particular agreement 

content delivery expenses consist of the postage costs to mail dvds to and from our paying subscribers the packaging and label costs for the mailers and all costs associated with streaming content over the internet we utilize thirdparty content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream content in high volume to our subscribers over the internet 

fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in content processing including operating and staffing our shipping centers as well as receiving encoding inspecting and warehousing our content library fulfillment expenses also include operating and staffing our customer service centers and credit card fees 

 

 the 6825 million increase in cost of revenues was due to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

   

 

 the 2781 million increase in cost of revenues was due to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 operating expenses 

marketing 

marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to our affiliates and consumer electronics partners and payroll related expenses advertising expenses include promotional activities such as television and online advertising as well as allocated costs of revenues relating to free trial periods payments to our affiliates and consumer electronics partners may be in the form of a fixedfee or may be a revenue sharing payment 

 

 the 1088 million increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to a 1196 million increase in marketing program spending attributable to increased spending in television radio and online advertising 

  

coupled with an increase in payments to our affiliates approximately half of these increases were incurred in our international segments in large part due to our launch in latin america and the caribbean these increases were partially offset by a decrease in direct mail and inserts and payments made to our consumer electronics partners the increase in marketing program spending was partially offset by decreases in the costs of free trials 

 

 the 561 million increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of 174 million in domestic spending related to our consumer electronics partners as we continued to expand the number of devices on which subscribers can view netflix content the increase is also due to a 162 million increase in other marketing program spending principally in tv and radio advertising to promote our service offset by a decrease in direct mail and inserts in addition costs of free trials increased 210 million due to the 677 increase in domestic gross unique subscriber additions coupled with shipments of instant streaming discs which enable subscribers to stream content to certain consumer electronic devices and the expanded use of one month free trials subscriber acquisition cost decreased primarily due to continued strong organic subscriber growth 

technology and development 

technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offering including testing maintaining and modifying our user interfaces our recommendation and merchandising technology as well as telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internaluse software systems technology and development expenses also include costs associated with computer hardware and software 

 

 the 957 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of an 830 million increase in personnelrelated costs these increases are primarily due to a 54 growth in average headcount supporting continued improvements in our streaming service and international expansion coupled with an 187 million increase in stockbased compensation expense 

 

 the 488 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 277 million increase in personnelrelated costs and a 142 million increase in facilities and equipment related expenses these increases are primarily due to a 210 growth in headcount supporting continued improvements to our service personnelrelated costs also increased due to a 57 million increase in stockbased compensation expense in addition costs paid for cloud computing services increased 77 million 

  

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel as well as recruiting professional fees and other general corporate expenses general and administrative expenses also include the gain on disposal of dvds 

 

 the 535 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 336 million attributed to an 115 million increase in stockbased compensation and a 32 increase in average headcount legal costs increased 66 million primarily resulting from an increase in costs associated with various claims against us we expect legal costs to continue at a high level for the foreseeable future as we defend these claims other miscellaneous expenses primarily related to the use of outside and professional services taxes and insurance increased by 133 million 

 

 the 177 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 117 million attributed to a 76 million increase in stockbased compensation expense and a 231 increase in headcount legal costs increased 89 million primarily resulting from ongoing litigation of claims against the company as well as a 21 million release of accruals in 2009 that was associated with a former class action suit that settled in 2008 the terms of the class action settlement provided certain former and current subscribers with an optional free month subscription or free onemonth upgrade to be utilized prior to the third quarter of 2009 the accrual related to those subscribers who did not utilize the free month prior to expiration was released in 2009 

legal settlement 

subsequent to december 31 2011 we engaged in mediation of a legal claim pending in the northern district of california made in january 2011 related to our compliance with the video privacy protection act this mediation resulted in a settlement of the matter which includes payment of 90 million which is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 and is anticipated to be paid in 2012 the company had previously evaluated this claim and determined it to be immaterial and that a potential loss was not probable accordingly no amount had been accrued prior to the mediation and settlement 

interest expense 

interest expense consists of the interest on our lease financing obligations and the interest on our 850 senior notes including the amortization of debt issuance costs starting in the fourth quarter of 2011 interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs on our convertible notes issued in november 2011 also in the fourth quarter of 2009 we expensed the debt issuance costs related to our line of credit 

 

   

interest expense was relatively flat as compared to the prior year interest expense in 2011 includes 21 million for our lease financing obligations 170 million of interest payments due on our 850 senior notes and 06 million of amortization of debt issuance costs 

 

 the 132 million increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense associated with our 850 senior notes interest expense in 2010 includes 23 million for our lease financing obligations 170 million of interest payments due on our 850 senior notes and 05 million of amortization of debt issuance costs 

provision for income taxes 

 

 in 2011 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to state income taxes of 150 million or 42 of income before income tax this was partially offset by the expiration of a statute of limitations for years 1997 through 2007 resulting in a discrete benefit of 35 million in the third quarter of 2011 and federal and california research and development “rd” tax credits of 51 million the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 was attributable to the discrete benefit of 35 million higher rd tax credits and a lower effective tax rate for california 

 

 in 2010 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to state income taxes of 156 million or 58 of income before income tax this was partially offset by rd tax credits of 33 million our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2010 was relatively flat as compared to our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations additionally in november 2011 we issued 2000 million of our convertible notes and raised an additional 2000 million through a public offering of common stock the convertible notes consist of 2000 million aggregate principal amount due on december 1 2018 and do not bear interest in november 2009 we issued 200 million of our 850 senior notes due november 15 2017 the “850 notes” interest on the 850 notes is payable semiannually at a rate of 850 per annum on may 15 and november 15 of each year commencing on may 15 2010 see note 4 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

  

our primary uses of cash included the acquisition and licensing of content content delivery expenses marketing our stock repurchase programs payroll related expenses and capital expenditures related to information technology and automation equipment we expect to continue to make significant investments to license streaming content both domestically and internationally these investments could impact our liquidity and in particular our operating cash flows 

as a result of the significant increase in subscriber cancellations negatively impacting domestic and consolidated revenues coupled with increased investments in our international streaming segment and in international content in particular we expect consolidated net losses and negative operating cash flows for 2012 although we currently anticipate that our available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may be required or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance current and projected compliance with our debt covenants and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

on june 11 2010 we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase 300 million of our common stock through the end of 2012 as of december 31 2011 410 million of this authorization is remaining the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements debt covenant requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions as we expect to have negative operating cash flows in future periods we do not expect to make further stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 

the following highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 cash provided by operating activities increased 413 million or 149 primarily due to an increase subscription revenues of 10420 million or 482 this increase was partially offset by increased payments for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 7663 million or 1384 operating cash flows were further impacted by increases in payroll expenses and payments for advertising and affiliates transactions 

cash used in investing activities increased 1497 million or 1290 primarily due to a 1640 million increase in the purchases net of proceeds from sales and maturities of shortterm investments in addition purchases of property and equipment increased 158 million primarily due to purchases of automation equipment for our various dvd shipping centers these increases were partially offset by a 387 million decrease in acquisitions of dvd content library 

cash provided by financing activities increased 3617 million or 3615 primarily due to our public offering of 29 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of 1999 million and 1981 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible notes in the fourth quarter of 2011 in addition 

  

repurchases of our common stock decreased by 106 million these increases were partially offset by a 302 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of options and a 164 million decrease in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation expense 

 

 cash provided by operating activities decreased by 487 million or 150 primarily due to increased payments for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 2678 million this increase was coupled with increased payroll expenses payments for advertising and affiliates transactions credit card fees content delivery expenses and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation the increase in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in subscription revenues of 4924 million resulting from a 409 increase in the domestic average number of paying subscribers 

cash used in investing activities decreased 1300 million or 528 primarily due to a 549 million decrease in the purchases net of proceeds of shortterm investments and a 691 million decrease in acquisitions of dvd content library as more dvds were obtained through revenue sharing arrangements in addition purchases of property and equipment decreased by 121 million as a significant amount of payments for automation equipment for our various shipping centers were made in 2009 

cash used in financing activities increased 154 million or 182 primarily due to the 1939 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our 850 notes in 2009 this decrease was partially offset by a 1141 million decrease in repurchases of our common stock coupled with a 495 million increase in the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation expense and a 145 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of options 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases maturities and sales of shortterm investments and cash flows from investments in businesses we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments repurchase our stock and for certain other activities free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 

in comparing free cash flow to net income the major recurring differences are excess streaming and dvd payments over expenses stockbased compensation expense deferred revenue taxes and semiannual interest payments on the 850 notes because consumers use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow for streaming content we typically enter into multiyear licenses with studios and other distributors that may result in an increase in content library and a corresponding increase in liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the payment terms for these license fees may extend over the term of the license agreements which typically range from six months to five years license 

  

fee obligations with payment terms that are due beyond one year are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as “noncurrent content liabilities” minimum commitments for licenses and known titles that do not meet the criteria for asset recognition in the content library are included in note 5 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

the following tables reconcile net cash provided by operating activities a gaap financial measure to free cash flow a nongaap financial measure 

 

 free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 555 million primarily due to an increase of 989 million in net income as adjusted for the increase in noncash stock based compensation of 336 million and decreased tax prepayments of 202 million this was partially offset by an increase in excess content payments over expenses of 532 million a 129 million increase in excess property and equipment payments over expense and decreased deferred revenue of 55 million payments for content increased 7276 million while content expenses increased 6744 million 

 

 free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 339 million primarily due to an increase of 604 million in net income as adjusted for the increase in noncash stock based compensation of 154 million decreased property and equipment payments over expense of 119 million and increased deferred revenue of 100 million this was partially offset by an increase in excess streaming and dvd content payments over expenses of 328 million coupled with increased tax prepayments of 140 million payments for content increased 1987 million while content expenses increased 1659 million 

effect of exchange rates 

revenues as well as certain expenses primarily content licensing and marketing incurred in the international streaming segment are denominated in the local currency during the year ended december 31 2011 and 2010 the gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents were immaterial 

contractual obligations 

for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or 

  

minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2011 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2011 

 

  

  

 we have entered into certain streaming content license agreements that include an unspecified or a maximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future andor that include pricing contingent upon certain variables such as theatrical exhibition receipts for the title as of the reporting date it is unknown whether we will receive access to these titles or what the ultimate price per title will be accordingly such amounts are not reflected in the above contractual obligations table however such amounts are expected to be significant and the expected timing of payment for these commitments could range from less than one year to more than five years 

 

 as of december 31 2011 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 281 million and an additional 24 million for gross interest and penalties classified as “other noncurrent liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheet at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities accordingly our operating results financial condition and cash flows are not subject to offbalance sheet risks 

  

indemnifications

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

content accounting 

we obtain content through streaming content license agreements dvd direct purchases and dvd revenue sharing agreements with studios distributors and other suppliers 

we obtain content distribution rights in order to stream tv shows and movies to subscribers’ tvs computers and mobile devices streaming content is generally licensed for a fixedfee for the term of the license agreement which may have multiple windows of availability the license agreement may or may not be recognized in content library 

when the streaming license fee is known or reasonably determinable for a specific title and the specific title is first available for streaming to subscribers the title is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as “current content library” for the portion available for streaming within one year and as “noncurrent content library” for the remaining portion new titles recognized in the content library are classified in the line item “additions to streaming content library” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows we amortize the content library on a straightline basis over each title’s contractual window of availability which typically ranges from six months to five years the steaming content library is reported at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value no write down from unamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented the amortization is classified in “cost of revenuessubscription” in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item “amortization of streaming content library” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows payment terms for these license fees may extend over the term of the license agreement which could range from six months to five years for the titles recognized in content library the license fees due but not paid are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as “content accounts payable” for the amounts due within one year and as “noncurrent content liabilities” for the amounts due beyond one year changes in these liabilities are classified in the line item “change in streaming content liabilities” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows we record the streaming content library assets and their related liability on our consolidated balance sheets at the gross amount of the liability payments for the titles not yet available for streaming are not yet recognized in the content library but in prepaid content minimum commitments for the titles not yet available for streaming are not yet recognized in the content library and are included in note 5 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

when the streaming license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title the title does not meet the criteria for asset recognition in the content library titles do not meet the criteria for asset 

  

recognition in the content library because the underlying license agreement does not specify the number of titles or the license fee per title or the windows of availability per title so that the license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title typical payment terms for these agreements which can range from three to five years require us to make equal fixed payments at the beginning of each quarter of the license term to the extent that cumulative payments exceed cumulative amortization “prepaid content” is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets we amortize the license fees on a straightline basis over the term of each license agreement the amortization is classified in “cost of revenues subscription” in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item “net income” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows changes in prepaid content are classified within net cash provided by operating activities in the line item “prepaid content” in the consolidated statements of cash flows commitments for licenses that do not meet the criteria for asset recognition in the content library are included in note 5 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

we acquire dvd content for the purpose of renting such content to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such we consider our direct purchase dvd library to be a productive asset accordingly we classify our dvd library in “noncurrent content library” on the consolidated balance sheets the acquisition of dvd content library net of changes in related liabilities is classified in the line item “acquisition of dvd content library” within cash used in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows because the dvd content library is considered a productive asset other companies in the inhome entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities we amortize our direct purchase dvds less estimated salvage value on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives the useful life of the new release dvds and backcatalog dvds is estimated to be one year and three years respectively the amortization of the dvd content library is classified in “cost of revenues—subscription” in the consolidated statement of operations and in the line item “amortization of dvd content library” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also obtain dvd content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors revenue sharing obligations incurred based on utilization are classified in “cost of revenues—subscription” in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item “net income” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the terms of some revenue sharing agreements obligate us to make a low initial payment for certain titles representing a minimum contractual obligation under the agreement the low initial payment is in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on utilization for a defined period of time the initial payment may be in the form of an upfront nonrefundable payment which is classified in content library or in the form of a prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid content 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period 

we calculate the fair value of new stockbased compensation awards under our stock option plans using a latticebinomial model we use a blackscholes model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares these models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted 

 

   

  

 income taxes 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2011 our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 281 million of which 224 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates see note 8 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding income taxes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents 

  

and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in “accumulated other comprehensive income” within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2011 our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities 

as of december 31 2011 we had securities classified as shortterm investments of 2898 million changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 

 

 a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2011 the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

the following table presents the hypothetical fair values in  thousands of our debt securities classified as shortterm investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the analysis is shown as of december 31 2011

 item 1 business tableend about us 

with 20 million subscribers as of december 31 2010 netflix inc “netflix” “the company” “we” or “us” is the world’s leading internet subscription service for enjoying tv shows and movies our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited tv shows and movies streamed over the internet to their tvs computers and mobile devices and in the united states subscribers can also receive standard definition dvds and their high definition successor bluray discs collectively referred to as “dvd” delivered quickly to their homes 

our core strategy is to grow our streaming subscription business within the united states and globally we are continuously improving the customer experience with a focus on expanding our streaming content enhancing our user interfaces and extending our streaming service to even more internetconnected devices while staying within the parameters of our operating margin targets 

by continuously improving the customer experience we believe we drive additional subscriber growth in the following ways 

 

  

  

 our business has and continues to evolve rapidly in 2010 we passed a significant milestone with the majority of our subscribers viewing more of their tv shows and movies via streaming than by dvd going forward we expect we will be primarily a global streaming business with the added feature of dvdsbymail in the us we believe delivery of entertainment video over the internet will be a very large global market opportunity and that our focus on one segment of that market—consumerpaid commercialfree streaming subscription of tv shows and movies—will enable us to continue to grow rapidly and profitably 

competition 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost many consumers maintain simultaneous 

  

relationships with multiple entertainment video providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another our principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

 operations 

we obtain content from various studios and other content providers through fixedfee licenses revenue sharing agreements and direct purchases we market our service through various channels including online advertising broadbased media such as television and radio as well as various strategic partnerships in connection with marketing the service we offer freetrial memberships to new and certain rejoining members rejoining members are an important source of subscriber additions we utilize the services of thirdparty cloud computing providers more specifically amazon web services as well as content delivery networks such as level 3 communications to help us efficiently stream tv shows and movies we also ship and receive dvds in the united states from a nationwide network of shipping centers 

segments 

we derive revenues from monthly subscription fees in our two segments united states and international in september 2010 we began international operations by offering an unlimited streaming plan without dvds in canada we anticipate further international expansion to additional markets in the second half of 2011 we currently generate substantially all our revenues in the united states and hold all our long lived assets in the united states 

seasonality 

our subscriber growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations in when consumers buy internetconnected devices and when they tend to increase video watching as a consequence subscriber growth is generally greatest in our fourth and first quarters october through march slowing in our second quarter april through june and then accelerating in our third quarter july through september additionally the variable expenses associated with shipments of dvds are impacted by the seasonal nature of the dvd release of movies 

intellectual property 

we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidential agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had 2180 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our dvd fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments as of december 31 2010 we had 2149 parttime and temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors tableend if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced significant subscriber growth over the past several years our ability to continue to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies furthermore the relative service levels content offerings pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers competitors include mvpds with free tv everywhere and vod content internet movie and tv content providers including both those that provide legal and illegal or pirated entertainment video content entertainment video retail stores and dvd rental outlets and kiosk services if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new or adjust existing services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract subscribers in addition many of our subscribers are rejoining our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract subscribers and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently the need to cut household expenses availability of content is limited dvd delivery takes too long competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies and evolving business models for delivery of entertainment video continue to develop at a fast pace the growth of internetconnected devices including television sets bluray players and mobile devices has increased the consumer acceptance of internet delivery of entertainment video through these new and existing distribution channels consumers are afforded various means for consuming entertainment video the various economic models underlying these differing means of entertainment video delivery include subscription payperview adsupported and piracybased models all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market several competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do they may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing new entrants may enter the market with unique service offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video and other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

changes in consumer viewing habits including more widespread usage of tv everywhere vod or other similar on demand methods of entertainment video consumption could adversely affect our business 

the manner in which consumers view entertainment video is changing rapidly digital cable wireless and internet content providers are continuing to improve technologies content offerings user interface and business models that allow consumers to access entertainment video on demand with interactive capabilities including start stop and rewind the devices through which entertainment video can be consumed are also changing rapidly today content from cable service providers may be viewed on laptops and content from internet content providers may be viewed on televisions although we provide our own internetbased delivery of content allowing our subscribers to stream certain tv shows and movies to their internetconnected televisions and other devices if other providers of entertainment video address the changes in consumer viewing habits in a manner that is better able to meet content distributor and consumer needs and expectations our business could be adversely affected 

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be adversely affected 

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 we are currently engaged in an effort to expand our operations internationally grow our streaming service with new content and across more devices as well as continue to operate our dvd service within the united states many of our systems and operational practices were implemented when we were at a smaller scale of operations and solely focused on domestic dvd operations as we undertake all these changes if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business including improving refining or revising our legacy systems and operational practices our business may be adversely affected 

if the market segment for consumer paid commercial free internet streaming of tv shows and movies saturates our business will be adversely affected 

the market segment for consumer paid commercial free internet streaming of tv shows and movies has grown significantly much of the increasing growth can be attributed to the ability of our subscribers to stream tv shows and movies on their tvs computers and mobile devices a decline in our rate of growth could indicate that the market segment for online subscriptionbased entertainment video is beginning to saturate while we believe that this segment will continue to grow for the foreseeable future if this market segment were to saturate our business would be adversely affected 

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we must continue to build and maintain strong brand identity we believe that strong brand identity will be important in attracting subscribers who may have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected from time to time our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among other things our title availability inventory allocation delivery processing and service interruptions furthermore thirdparty devices that enable instant streaming of tv shows and movies from netflix may not meet consumer expectations to the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected with respect to our planned international expansion we will also need to establish our brand and to the extent we are not successful our business in new markets would be adversely impacted 

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including paid search listings banner ads text links 

  

and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program we also engage our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including tv and radio advertising direct mail and print campaigns consumer package and mailing insertions we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership we maintain an active public relations program to increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide that we are negatively impacting their business that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such marketing channels in addition if ad rates increase we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our cost per subscriber laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of email and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

the increasingly longterm and fixedcost nature of our content acquisition licenses may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in connection with obtaining content particularly for streaming content we typically enter into multiyear fixedfee licenses with studios and other distributors as of december 31 2010 we had over 12 billion in such contractual commitments covering payments due over the next several years furthermore we plan on increasing the level of committed content licensing in anticipation of our service and subscriber base continuing to grow to the extent subscriber andor revenue growth do not meet our expectations our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of these content licensing commitments and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate could be limited 

if we become subject to liability for content that we distribute through our service our results of operations would be adversely affected 

as a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations we cannot assure that we are insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us 

if studios and other content distributors refuse to license streaming content to us upon acceptable terms our business could be adversely affected 

streaming content over the internet involves the licensing of rights which are separate from and independent of the rights we acquire when obtaining dvd content our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch instantly therefore depends on studios and other content distributors licensing us content specifically 

  

for internet delivery the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios and other content distributors change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to license us content our ability to stream content to our subscribers will be adversely affected unlike dvd streaming content is not subject to the first sale doctrine as such we are completely dependent on the studio or other content distributor to license us content in order to access and stream content many of the licenses provide for the studios or other content distributor to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice in addition the studios and other content distributors have great flexibility in licensing content they may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming content for example hbo licenses content from studios like warner bros and the license provides hbo with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services including netflix as such netflix cannot license certain warner bros content for delivery to its subscribers while warner bros may nonetheless license the same content to transactional vod providers if we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us our ability to stream tv shows and movies to our subscribers will be adversely impacted and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be adversely impacted as streaming content license agreements expire we must renegotiate new terms which may not be favorable to us if this happens the cost of obtaining content could increase and our margins may be adversely affected as we grow we are able to spend an increasingly larger amount for the licensing of streaming content we believe that the streaming content we make available to our subscribers is sufficiently diversified such that we will not be forced to pay licensing fees for content in excess of our desired operational margins we believe that any failure to secure content will manifest in lower subscriber acquisition and retention and not in materially reduced margins nonetheless given the multipleyear duration and largely fixed nature of content licenses if we do not experience subscriber acquisition and retention as forecasted our margins may be impacted by these fixed content licensing costs during the course of our license relationship various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and other content distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted 

we rely upon a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices 

we currently offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their pcs macs and other internetconnected devices including bluray players and tvs digital video players game consoles and mobile devices we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our consumer electronics partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration a number our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our subscribers use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

if the popularity of the dvd format continues to slow or if the retail sales prices of dvds decline our business could be adversely affected 

although the growth of dvd sales continues to slow we believe that the dvd will continue to be a valuable consumer proposition and studio profit center for the next several years as dvd sales begin to decline studios and other resellers may significantly lower prices to encourage consumers to continue to utilize the format unless we are successful at retaining our subscribers with our streaming offerings a decline in the 

  

popularity of the dvd as indicated by declining sales or a reduction in price leading to consumers purchasing instead of using our service could result in our business could be adversely affected 

if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine or if studios were to release or distribute titles on dvd in a manner that attempts to circumvent or limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected 

under us copyright law once a copyright owner sells a copy of his work the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy while the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work the copyright owner gives up his ability to control the fate of the work once it had been sold as such once a dvd is sold into the market those obtaining the dvd are permitted to resell it rent it or otherwise dispose of it if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine our ability to obtain content and then rent it could be adversely affected by way of example the court of appeals for the 9 th circuit recently ruled that the first sale doctrine did not apply to sales of software that contained contractual limitations on resales to the extent such a ruling were extended to dvd sales our ability to obtain content for subsequent rental could be adversely impacted likewise if content providers agree to limit the sale or distribution of their content in ways that try to limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected for example we have entered into agreements with several studios to delay the availability of new release dvds for rental for a brief period of time following the dvds release to the retail market and in connection therewith these studios have prohibited certain of their wholesalers from selling dvds to us prior to such availability furthermore certain content owners from time to time have established exclusive rental windows with particular outlets this happened in late 2006 and again in late 2007 when blockbuster announced arrangements with certain content owners pursuant to which blockbuster would receive content on dvds for rental exclusively by blockbuster to the extent content is to be distributed exclusively and not to retail vendors or distributors we could be prevented from obtaining such content and those or our competitors who access such content could enjoy a corresponding competitive advantage to the extent the content is also sold to retail vendors or distributors under current law we would not be prohibited from obtaining and renting such content pursuant to the first sale doctrine nonetheless to the extent content owners do not distribute to us directly or through their wholesalers or otherwise establish exclusive rental windows it will impact our ability to obtain such content in the most efficient manner and in some cases in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand if such arrangements were to become more commonplace or if additional impediments to obtaining content were created our ability to obtain content could be impacted and our business could be adversely affected 

increased availability of new releases of entertainment video to other distribution channels prior to or on parity with the release on dvd coupled with delayed availability of such dvds through our service could adversely affect our business 

except for theatrical release dvds currently enjoy a competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early distribution window on the dvd format the window for new releases on dvd is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview internet delivery premium tv basic cable and network and syndicated tv the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies and the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel are determined solely by the studio releasing the title over the past several years the major studios have shortened the release windows and have increasingly made new release movies available simultaneously on dvd and vod if other distribution channels were to receive priority over or parity with dvd coupled with delayed availability of such dvd through our service our subscribers might find these other distribution channels of more value than our service and our business could be adversely affected 

delayed availability of new release dvds for rental could adversely affect our business 

our licensing agreements with several studios require that we do not rent new release dvds until some period of time typically twentyeight days after such dvds are first made available for retail sale these 

  

agreements provide us with less expensive content as well as deeper copy depth than we might otherwise have absent the delay thus improving both our business and consumer experience while several competitors have used the delayed availability of dvd content through our service to differentiate their own services we do not believe that this delayed availability has materially impacted our subscriber growth or satisfaction nonetheless it is possible that the delay in obtaining new release content could impact consumer perception of our service or otherwise negatively impact subscriber satisfaction furthermore if the studios were to increase the period of delay which some studios have suggested we may yet experience these impacts in which case our business could be adversely impacted 

we could be subject to increased costs arising from our acquisition of dvd content and our subscribers’ demand for dvd titles that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 

we obtain dvds through a mix of revenue sharing agreements and direct purchases the type of agreement we utilize to acquire dvd content depends on the economic terms we can negotiate as well as studio preferences if we are unable to negotiate favorable terms to acquire the dvds our operating margins may be adversely affected furthermore during the course of our agreements various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted direct purchase of dvds requires us to be able to accurately forecast demand in order to ensure that we have enough copies of a title to satisfy but not exceed demand so that our subscriber satisfaction is not negatively impacted however if we purchase excess copies of title or experience an increase in usage of a title without a corresponding increase in subscriber retention and growth our content and fulfillment costs will increase disproportionately to revenues thus adversely affecting our operating results our content costs as a percentage of revenues can also increase if our subscribers select titles that were acquired under more expensive revenue share arrangements more often than they select other titles acquired through direct purchase or lower cost revenue share arrangements 

any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of thirdparties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business 

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site or their tvs computers or mobile devices our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of thirdparties that we utilize in our operations interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general including discriminatory network management practices could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections from time to time we experience service interruptions and have voluntarily provided affected subscribers with a credit during periods of extended outage much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

our servers and those of thirdparties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our insurance does not cover expenses related to attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our service or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider in addition we utilize thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing 

  

services in connection with our business operations we also utilize thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet problems faced by our thirdparty web hosting cloud computing or content delivery network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers in addition fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business 

we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted 

amazon web services or aws provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing storage capabilities and other services provided by aws currently we run the majority of our computing at aws given this along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted while the retail side of amazon may compete with us we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service 

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation and merchandising technology our business may suffer 

our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation and merchandising technology to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure that our recommendation and merchandising technology will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

we are continually refining our recommendation and merchandising technology in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements in addition we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation technology 

if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

 

  

  

 we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to stream tv shows and movies and to manage other aspects of our operations including processing delivery and return of our dvds to our subscribers and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we continually enhance or modify the technology used for our operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be 

  

of value to our subscribers future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the streaming of tv shows and movies to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner andor the processing of dvds among our shipping centers our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired in addition if our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired also any harm to our subscribers’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather natural disasters labor activism health epidemics or bioterrorism our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage and theft during our processing of shipments as well as during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage and theft rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit 

increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on may 12 2008 to 42 cents and again on may 11 2009 to 44 cents it is expected that the us postal service will raise rates again in subsequent years in accordance with the powers given the us postal service in connection with the 2007 postal reform legislation the us postal service continues to focus on plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds and our gross margin could be adversely affected for example the office of inspector general “oig” at the us postal service issued a report in november 2007 recommending that the us postal service revise the machinability qualifications for first class mail related to dvds or to charge dvd mailers who don’t comply with the new regulations a 17 cent surcharge on all mail deemed unmachinable in addition a bymail game rental company filed a complaint with the postal regulatory commission alleging that the us postal service unreasonably discriminated against it in favor of netflix and blockbuster to the extent this proceeding was to result in operational or regulatory changes impacting our mail processing our gross margins and business operations could be adversely affected also if the us postal service curtails its services such as by closing facilities or discontinuing or reducing saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be adversely affected 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

  

the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws limiting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business for example in late 2010 the federal communications commission adopted socalled net neutrality rules intended in part to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks the rules are likely to be subject to interpretation and legal challenge to the extent that these rules are interpreted to enable network operators to engage in discriminatory practices or are overturned by legal challenge our business could be adversely impacted as we expand internationally government regulation concerning the internet and in particular network neutrality may be nascent or nonexistent within such a regulatory environment coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business 

changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business 

we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing including meaningful bandwidth caps or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted for example in late 2010 comcast informed level 3 communications that it would require level 3 to pay for the ability to access comcast’s network given that much of the traffic being requested by comcast customers is netflix data stored with level 3 many commentators have looked to this situation as an example of comcast either discriminating against netflix traffic or trying to increase netflix’s operating costs furthermore to the extent network operators were to create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers our business could be negatively impacted 

most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming as such companies like comcast time warner cable and cablevision have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours our business could be negatively impacted 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and our disclosure of or unauthorized access to subscriber data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our subscribers we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to use collected data could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if unauthorized access to our subscriber data were to occur or if we were to disclose data about our subscribers in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results 

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our subscriber data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our subscribers including names and in many cases mailing addresses with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and 

  

authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data if despite these measures we or our payment processing services experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers we could face legal claims and our business could be adversely affected similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

in addition we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory and streaming typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

increases in payment processing fees or changes to operating rules would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit cards our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to rules regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods which are predominately credit cards and debit cards these rules regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and from time to time we expect to file for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved thirdparties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us thirdparties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

  

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of thirdparties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time thirdparties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site streaming technology our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent thirdparties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations could be adversely affected 

our executive offices and data centers are located in the san francisco bay area we have shipping centers located throughout the united states including earthquake and hurricanesensitive areas our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of these natural disasters as well as from electrical blackouts fires floods power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations to handle disruptions in service arising from these events because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our executive offices and data centers we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes and may not have adequate insurance to cover losses and expenses from other natural disasters 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us 

  

most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

we could be subject to economic political regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations 

in september 2010 we began international operations by offering an unlimited streaming plan without dvds in canada and we anticipate further international expansion operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory economic and political risks that are different from and incremental to those in the united states in addition to the risks that we face in the united states our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business and results of our operations 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

we issued 200 million in a debt offering and may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of december 31 2010 we have 200 million in 850 senior notes outstanding risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

   

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet certain covenants the failure to comply with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses any failure to comply with the restrictions of any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements 

risks related to our stock ownership 

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise control over netflix 

as of december 31 2010 our executive officers and directors and their immediate family members beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 11 of our outstanding common stock and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days in particular reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board beneficially owned approximately 5 these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from other stockholders and will be able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 

   

  

  

  

 in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded since our may 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues gross margin operating expenses number of net additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

 the following represents our performance highlights for 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 the increase in total subscribers as well as the acceleration in our net subscriber additions has fueled the significant growth in our revenues these increases are offset partially by a reduction in the average revenue per paying subscriber which reflects the popularity of our lower priced plans 

in 2010 we passed a significant milestone with the majority of our subscribers viewing more of their tv shows and movies via streaming than by dvd streaming hours are currently growing faster than dvd hours and while dvd shipments have grown 97 in 2010 we expect shipments will be flat to declining in future periods 

in september 2010 we began international operations by offering an unlimited streaming plan without dvds in canada substantially all of our revenues operating income and net income are still generated in the united states however initial results from our canada expansion indicate positive operating margins may be achieved during 2011 as a result of this early success we anticipate further international expansion into 

  

additional markets in the second half of 2011 and will manage our business going forward with two distinct operating segments united states and international in 2011 operating margins for the united states are expected to increase while international operating margins are expected to be negative as we invest in our international operations 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably over each subscriber’s monthly subscription period we record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues we currently generate substantially all of our revenues in the united states in 2010 we began international operations by offering an unlimited streaming plan without dvds in canada we anticipate further international expansion in the second half of 2011 

we offer subscription plans in the united states and canada that allow our subscribers to instantly watch unlimited tv shows and movies streamed over the internet to their tvs computers and mobile devices in the united states we offer a variety of subscription plans that in addition to streaming offer subscribers dvds by mail the price per plan varies based on the number of dvds that a subscriber has out at any given point as of december 31 2010 approximately 85 of our subscriber base has chosen either the unlimited streaming plan without dvds at 799 per month or a 1 or 2 dvdout unlimited plan which are priced at 999 and 1499 per month respectively customers electing access to high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds pay a surcharge ranging from 1 to 4 for our most popular plans 

  

the following table presents our yearend subscriber information 

 

  

  

 the 4924 million increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 413 growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from the continuous improvement to our customer experience which in turn drives consumer awareness of our service benefits this increase was offset in part by an 83 decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans the total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2out plans grew by 698 as compared to a 150 decline in all other plans during the year ended december 31 2010 in the fourth quarter of 2010 when we introduced the unlimited streaming plan without dvds over onethird of new subscribers elected this option 

 

 the 3056 million increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 266 growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the compelling value proposition of streaming and dvds by mail for one low price and other benefits of our service this increase was offset in part by a 33 decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans the total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2out plans grew by 481 as compared to a 11 decline in all other plans during the year ended december 31 2009 

until the average price paid by our new subscriber additions is equal to the average price paid by existing subscribers our average monthly revenue per paying subscriber will continue to decline we expect lower priced plans to continue to grow as a percentage of our subscriber base 

  

cost of revenues 

cost of subscription 

cost of subscription revenues consists of expenses related to the acquisition and licensing of content as well as content delivery costs related to providing streaming content and shipping dvds to subscribers costs related to freetrial periods are allocated to marketing expenses 

content acquisition and licensing expenses consist primarily of amortization of streaming content licenses amortization of dvd library and revenue sharing expenses we obtain content through streaming content license agreements dvd direct purchases and dvd and streaming revenue sharing agreements with studios distributors and other suppliers 

content delivery expenses consist of the postage costs to mail dvds to and from our paying subscribers the packaging and label costs for the mailers and all costs associated with streaming content over the internet we utilize thirdparty content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream content in high volume to our subscribers over the internet 

 

 the 2446 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors 

 

  

  

 the 1483 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors 

 

  

   

fulfillment expenses 

fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in content processing including operating and staffing our shipping centers as well as receiving encoding inspecting and warehousing our content library fulfillment expenses also include operating and staffing our customer service centers and credit card fees 

 

 the 334 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following 

 

  

  

 the 207 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following 

 

  

 gross margin 

 

   

the 18 percentage point increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower dvd content acquisition expenses per dvd mailed and a 223 decline in monthly dvd rentals per average paying subscriber driven by the growing popularity of our lower priced plans and streaming this decline in dvd usage was larger than the decline in average revenue per paying subscriber of 83 the resulting increase to gross margin was offset partially by increased investments in our streaming content 

 

 the 21 percentage point increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower dvd content acquisition expenses per dvd mailed and a 63 decline in monthly dvd rentals per average paying subscriber driven by the growing popularity of our lower priced plans this decline was larger than the decline in average revenue per paying subscriber of 33 the resulting increase to gross margin was offset partially by increased investments in our streaming content 

we have increased and expect to continue to increase investments in content in particular streaming content these investments would reduce our gross margin to the extent that increases in content acquisition and licensing expenses outpace growth in our revenues 

operating expenses 

technology and development 

technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offering including testing maintaining and modifying our user interfaces our recommendation and merchandising technology as well as telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internaluse software systems technology and development expenses also include costs associated with computer hardware and software as well as certain costs paid for thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing services used in connection with our business 

 

 the 488 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 277 million increase in personnelrelated costs and a 142 million increase in facilities and equipment related expenses these increases are primarily due to a 21 growth in headcount supporting continued improvements to our service personnelrelated costs also increased due to a 57 million increase in stockbased compensation in addition costs paid for cloud computing services increased 77 million 

 

 the 247 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 174 million increase in personnelrelated costs due to 266 growth in headcount to develop solutions for streaming 

  

content and continued improvements to our service the increase is also partly due to a 67 million increase in facilities and equipment expenses to support the increased headcount and overall growth of operations 

marketing 

marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to our affiliates and consumer electronics partners and payroll related expenses advertising expenses include promotional activities such as television and online advertising as well as allocated costs of revenues relating to free trial periods payments to our affiliates and consumer electronics partners may be in the form of a fixedfee or may be a revenue sharing payment 

 

 the 561 million increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of 174 million in spending related to our consumer electronics partners as we continued to expand the number of devices on which subscribers can view netflix content the increase is also due to a 162 million increase in other marketing program spending principally in tv and radio advertising to promote our service offset by a decrease in direct mail and inserts in addition costs of free trials increased 210 million due to the 747 increase in gross subscriber additions coupled with shipments of instant streaming discs which enable subscribers to stream content to certain consumer electronic devices and the expanded use of one month free trials subscriber acquisition cost decreased primarily due to continued strong organic subscriber growth 

 

 the 380 million increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of 214 million in spending related to affiliates including our consumer electronics partners the increase is also due to an 115 million increase in other marketing program spending principally in tv and radio advertising and direct mail to promote our service subscriber acquisition cost decreased primarily due to momentum associated with the launch of new consumer electronics partner devices and the broad appeal of streaming content 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive finance content acquisition and administrative personnel as well as recruiting professional fees and other general corporate expenses 

 

   

the 192 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 117 million attributed to a 76 million increase in stockbased compensation and a 231 increase in headcount legal costs increased 89 million primarily resulting from ongoing litigation of claims against the company as well as a 21 million release of accruals in 2009 that was associated with a former class action suit that settled in 2008 the terms of the class action settlement provided certain former and current subscribers with an optional free month subscription or free onemonth upgrade to be utilized prior to the third quarter of 2009 the accrual related to those subscribers who did not utilize the free month prior to expiration was released in 2009 we expect legal costs to continue at a high level for the foreseeable future as we defend these claims 

 

 the 17 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 74 million increase in legal costs resulting from ongoing litigation of claims against the company this increase is offset partially by a 27 million decrease in costs related to a significant reduction in the level of operations of our subsidiary red envelope entertainment and a 21 million release of accruals in 2009 associated with a former class action suit that was settled in 2008 the terms of the class action settlement provided certain former and current subscribers with an optional free month subscription or free onemonth upgrade to be utilized prior to the third quarter of 2009 the accrual related to those subscribers who did not utilize the free month prior to expiration was released we also had decreases in personnelrelated costs due to lower headcount as we streamline our administrative functions 

interest expense 

interest expense consists of the interest on our lease financing obligations and the interest on our 850 senior notes including the amortization of debt issuance costs also in the fourth quarter of 2009 we expensed the debt issuance costs related to our line of credit 

 

 the 132 million increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense associated with our 850 senior notes interest expense in 2010 includes 23 million for our lease financing obligations 170 million of interest payments due on our notes and 05 million of amortization of debt issuance costs 

 

 the 40 million increase in interest expense is entirely attributable to the interest expense associated with our 850 senior notes and line of credit interest expense in 2009 includes 28 million for our lease financing obligations 26 million of interest payments due on our notes and 11 million of amortization of debt issuance costs 

  

interest and other income 

interest and other income consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from invested cash and shortterm investments 

 

 the 30 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily attributable to a 18 million dollar gain realized in 2009 on the sale of our investment in a private company which we had accounted for under the cost method coupled with lower average cash and investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock 

 

 the 57 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily attributable to lower cash and investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock and a 16 million decrease in realized gains recognized as compared to the prior year the decrease was offset by a 18 million dollar gain realized in 2009 on the sale of our investment in a private company which we accounted for under the cost method 

interest and dividend income was approximately 27 million 37 million and 92 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively interest and other income included gains of approximately 10 million 15 million and 31 million on the sale of shortterm investments in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

provision for income taxes 

 

 in 2010 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes of 156 million or 58 of income before income tax this was partially offset by federal and california research and development “rd” tax credits of 33 million our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2010 was relatively flat as compared to our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2009 

in december 2010 the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 was signed into law one of the major components of this legislation is the reinstatement of the federal rd credit retroactively to january 1 2010 as a result we recorded a federal rd credit of approximately 18 million as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2010 

 

   

in 2009 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes of 104 million or 54 of income before income tax this was partially offset by federal and california rd tax credits of 16 million the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a cumulative benefit recorded as a discrete item in the second quarter of 2008 for prior period rd tax credits 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations additionally in november 2009 we issued 200 million of our 850 senior notes due in 2017 our primary uses of cash include payroll advertising and payments to consumer electronics partners stock repurchases acquisition and licensing of content content delivery fulfillment expenses taxes and capital expenditures related to information technology and automation equipment we expect to continue to make substantial investments to obtain content and in particular expect to increase spending associated with streaming content streaming content commitments have grown and continue to grow as we typically enter into multiyear fixedfee licenses these investments could impact our liquidity and in particular our operating cash flows 

although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with our available funds will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 

on june 11 2010 we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase 300 million of our common stock through the end of 2012 as of december 31 2010 2406 million of this authorization is remaining the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements debt covenant requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions 

the following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased by 487 million or 150 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to increased spending for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 2678 million this increase was coupled with increased content delivery expenses of 787 million primarily resulting from a 97 increase in the number of dvds mailed to paying subscribers and higher costs associated with our use of thirdparty delivery networks to deliver streaming content increased promotional advertising activities and expenses related to our affiliates and consumer electronics partners totaling 336 million increased payroll expenses of 362 million due to a 11 increase in employees increased fulfillment expenses of 334 million and increased current tax provision of 

  

305 million in addition excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation increased by 495 million the increase in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in subscription revenues of 4924 million resulting from a 413 increase in the average number of paying subscribers 

cash provided by operating activities increased by 410 million or 144 during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues of 3056 million resulting from a 266 increase in the average number of paying subscribers this increase in subscription revenues was partially offset by an increase in spending for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of 677 million this increase was coupled with increased content delivery expenses of 1017 million primarily resulting from an 186 increase in the number of dvds mailed to paying subscribers and higher costs associated with our use of thirdparty delivery networks to deliver streaming content increased promotional advertising activities and expenses related to our affiliates and consumer electronic partners totaling 329 million increased payroll expenses of 273 million due to a 25 increase in employees increased fulfillment expenses of 207 million and increased current tax provision of 279 million 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2010 decreased 1300 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to a 1206 million decrease in the purchases of availableforsale securities and a 691 million decrease in acquisitions of dvd content library as more dvds were obtained through revenue sharing arrangements in addition purchases of property and equipment decreased by 121 million as a significant amount of payments for automation equipment for our various shipping centers were made in 2009 this decrease was partially offset by a 657 million decrease in proceeds from the sales and maturities of availableforsale securities 

cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2009 increased 1011 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to a 1050 million decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of availableforsale securities partially offset by a decrease in the purchases of availableforsale securities of 290 million in addition acquisitions of dvds increased by 302 million 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2010 increased 154 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the 1939 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our 850 senior notes in 2009 this decrease was partially offset by a 1141 million decrease in repurchases of our common stock coupled with a 495 million increase in the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and a 145 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 

cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2009 decreased by 920 million as compared to 2008 primarily due to the 1939 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our 850 senior notes and a 164 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in addition the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation increased by 75 million in 2009 these cash inflows were offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock of 1244 million 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating and investing activities excluding the nonoperational cash flows from purchases and sales of shortterm investments and cash flows from investments in businesses we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures during a given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations make investments repurchase our stock and for certain other activities free cash flow is considered a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for net income operating income cash flow from operating 

  

activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities a gaap financial measure to free cash flow a nongaap financial measure 

 

 free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 339 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to lower dvd content library and property and equipment expenditures these reduced spending levels more than offset the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities described above 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2009 increased 24 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to an increase in cash flow from operations offset by higher dvd content library expenditures and a decrease in the proceeds from sale of previously viewed dvds 

contractual obligations 

for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2010 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2010 

 

  

  

   

we have entered into certain license agreements that include an unspecified or a maximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future andor that include pricing contingent upon certain variables such as domestic theatrical exhibition receipts for the title as of the reporting date it is unknown whether we will receive access to these titles or what the ultimate price per title will be accordingly such amounts are not reflected in the above contractual obligations table however such amounts are expected to be significant 

as of december 31 2010 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 207 million and an additional 17 million for gross interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not engaged in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities accordingly our operating results financial condition and cash flows are not presently subject to offbalance sheet risks 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in these circumstances payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and in some instances we may have recourse against thirdparties for certain payments in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers the terms of such obligations vary 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

content accounting 

we obtain content through streaming content license agreements dvd direct purchases and dvd and streaming revenue sharing agreements with studios distributors and other suppliers 

we obtain content distribution rights in order to stream tv shows and movies to subscribers’ tvs computers and mobile devices streaming content is generally licensed for a fixedfee for the term of the license agreement the license agreement may or may not be recognized in content library 

  

when the streaming license fee is known or reasonably determinable for a specific title and the specific title is first available for streaming to subscribers the title is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as current content library for the portion available for streaming within one year and as noncurrent content library for the remaining portion new titles recognized in the content library are classified in the line item “acquisition of streaming content library” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows we amortize the content library on a straightline basis over each title’s window of availability the amortization is classified in cost of subscription in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item “amortization of content library” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the titles recognized in content library the license fees due but not paid are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as “accounts payable” for the amounts due within one year and as “other noncurrent liabilities” for the amounts due beyond one year changes in these liabilities are classified in the line items “accounts payable” and “other assets and liabilities” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows commitments for the titles not yet available for streaming are not yet recognized in the content library and are included in footnote 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

when the streaming license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title the title does not meet the criteria for recognition in the content library the license fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title in fixed fee license agreements that do not specify the number of titles the license fee per title and the windows of availability per title over the term of these agreements we typically make periodic fixed prepayments that are classified in prepaid content on the consolidated balance sheets we amortize the license fees on a straightline basis over the term of each license agreement the amortization is classified in cost of subscription in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item “net income” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows changes in prepaid content are classified within net cash provided by operating activities in the line item “prepaid content” in the consolidated statements of cash flows commitments for licenses that do not meet the criteria for recognition in the content library are included in footnote 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

we acquire dvd content for the purpose of renting such content to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such we consider our direct purchase dvd library to be a productive asset accordingly we classify our dvd library as a noncurrent asset on the consolidated balance sheets the acquisition of dvd content library net of changes in related liabilities is classified in the line item “acquisition of dvd content library” within cash used in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows because the dvd content library is considered a productive asset other companies in the inhome entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities we amortize our direct purchase dvds less estimated salvage value on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives the useful life of the new release dvds and backcatalog dvds is estimated to be one year and three years respectively in estimating the useful life of its dvds we consider historical utilization patterns primarily the number of times a dvd title is shipped to subscribers in a given period as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds the amortization of the dvd content library is classified in cost of subscription in the consolidated statement of operations and in the line item “amortization of content library” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

we also obtain dvd and streaming content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors revenue sharing obligations incurred based on utilization are classified in cost of subscription in the consolidated statements of operations and in the line item “net income” within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the terms of some revenue sharing agreements obligate us to make a low initial payment for certain titles representing a minimum contractual obligation under the agreement the low initial payment is in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on utilization for a defined period of time or the title term which typically ranges from six to twelve months for each title the initial payment may be in the form of an upfront nonrefundable payment this payment is capitalized in the content library in accordance with our dvd and streaming content policies as applicable the initial payment may also be in the form of a prepayment of future 

  

revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid content this payment is amortized as revenue sharing obligations are incurred if during the title term we determine that the full prepayment will not be amortized based on utilization a provision for the estimated difference is recorded in the period that such shortfall is deemed probable under the revenue sharing agreements for our dvd library at the end of the title term we generally have the option of returning the dvds to the studio destroying the dvds or purchasing the dvds in most cases we purchase the dvds when we have the ability to do so this end of term buyout is also included in dvd library at the time of purchase 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation cost at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period 

we calculate the fair value of new stockbased compensation awards under our stock option plans using a latticebinomial model we use a blackscholes model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares these models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted 

 

  

 income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

although we believe our assumptions judgments and estimates are reasonable changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses actual operating results in future years could differ from our current 

  

assumptions judgments and estimates however we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 

we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december 31 2010 our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were 207 million of which 168 million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 

as of december 31 2010 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2010 our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities 

at december 31 2010 we had securities classified as shortterm investments of 1559 million changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 

 

 a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2010 the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

  

the following table presents the hypothetical fair values in  thousands of our debt securities classified as shortterm investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the analysis is shown as of december 31 2010

 item 1 business tableend with more than 12 million subscribers we are the world’s largest subscription service streaming movies and tv episodes over the internet and sending dvds by mail our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited movies and tv episodes streamed to their tvs and computers and can receive dvds delivered quickly to their homes we offer a variety of subscription plans with no due dates no late fees no shipping fees and no payperview fees aided by our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology subscribers can select from a growing library of titles that can be watched instantly and a vast array of titles on dvd on average approximately 2 million discs are shipped daily from our distribution centers across the united states additionally more than 48 of our subscribers instantly watched more than 15 minutes of streaming content in the fourth quarter of 2009 

subscribers can 

 

  

 our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of streaming and dvdbymail content by combining streaming and dvd as part of the netflix subscription we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely compelling selection of movies for one low monthly price we believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service this advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the internet from competing services by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand distribution and our proprietary merchandising platform despite the growing popularity of internet delivered content we expect that the standard definition dvd along with its high definition successor bluray collectively referred to as “dvd” will continue to be the primary means by which a majority of netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future however at some point in the future we expect that internet delivery of content to the home will surpass dvd as the primary means by which most netflix subscribers view content 

we promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs including online promotions tv and radio advertising package inserts direct mail and other promotions with third parties we also engage 

  

our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service these programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period at the end of the free trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers unless they cancel their subscription all paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of wordofmouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs 

we use our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to determine which titles are presented to a subscriber in doing so we believe we provide our subscribers with a quick and personalized way to find titles they are more likely to enjoy while also effectively managing our inventory utilization our merchandising efforts are used throughout our web site and as part of the user interface on many netflix ready devices to determine which titles are displayed to subscribers including the generation of lists of similar titles we believe our merchandising efforts create a powerful method for catalog browsing and efficient library utilization 

we obtain content through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements and license agreements with studios distributors and other suppliers dvd content is typically obtained through direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements streaming content is generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement 

we ship and receive dvds throughout the united states and maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allows us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers we also utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream movies and tv episodes in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet 

we are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to minimize variable and fixed operating costs within the framework of providing a valuable and compelling user experience our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements 

we are organized in a single operating segment we currently generate all our revenues in the united states although we plan to launch a limited international expansion with a streaming subscription service in 2010 substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees we have no longlived assets outside the united states 

industry and competitive overview 

we operate in the subscription segment of the inhome entertainment video market in 2007 we expanded our dvdbymail distribution model to include streaming content over the internet this hybrid distribution model expands the consumer appeal of the netflix subscription service beyond the traditional reach of the dvd rental segment and offers subscribers a uniquely compelling selection of content both streaming and dvd for one low monthly price while the consumer appeal of this hybrid service has grown quickly the market for internet delivered video content is still in its formative stages and we expect competition to be intense 

currently the market for internet delivered video consists of three market segments videoondemand “vod” ad supported and subscription the vod segment includes competitors like amazon apple blockbuster cinemanow and microsoft the ad supported segment includes competitors like hulu and youtube currently netflix is the primary provider in the subscription segment but we expect direct and indirect competition to emerge and continue to grow as the consumer appeal for internet delivery of video continues to expand 

the market for inhome entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome entertainment video providers and can 

  

easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to cable rent a dvd from redbox or blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart or amazon download a movie from apple itunes watch a tv show on hulucom and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost dvds and internet delivery of content represent only two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing entertainment video in addition the growth in adoption of dvd and internet delivery of content is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies 

our principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 studio licensing and movie distribution 

motion pictures including movies and tv episodes “entertainment video” are distributed broadly through a variety of channels including movie theaters airlines hotels and inhome inhome distribution channels include dvd rental retail outlets and web sites internet delivery and cable satellite and telecommunication providers offering basic and premium tv payperview and vod currently studios distribute movies approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market three to seven months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to premium tv and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and network tv internet delivered content is made available typically at the same time as payperview or vod however some content such as tv episodes are often made available for internet viewing shortly after the original airing date the major studios and tv networks have continued to experiment with shortened release windows and we anticipate that they will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional windows including releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod 

competitive strengths 

we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths 

iconic brand  netflix has been highly rated in online retail customer satisfaction by independent surveys from nielsen online and in every one of the ten consecutive surveys conducted by foreseefgi research because of the high level of consumer satisfaction with netflix over 90 percent of surveyed subscribers say that they would recommend the netflix service to a friend we believe that these high levels of customer satisfaction and brand loyalty make it expensive and difficult for competitors to displace netflix as a subscription segment leader 

personalized merchandising  we utilize various tools including our proprietary recommendation technology to create a custom interface for each subscriber we believe that this customization enhances the user experience by helping netflix subscribers discover great movies subscribers rate titles through our service and our recommendation technology compares these ratings to the database of ratings collected from our entire user base for each subscriber these comparisons are used to make predictions about specific titles the subscriber may enjoy these predictions along with other factors are used to help merchandise titles to 

  

subscribers we believe that our recommendation technology and our other merchandising practices allow us to create broadbased demand for our library and maximize utilization of our library by creating demand for content we seek to costeffectively balance subscriber demand between newer more expensive titles and older less expensive titles our ability to generate demand for these older or “longtail” titles while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction helps us manage and maintain our gross margin subscriber acquisition cost churn rate and lifetime subscriber profit to that end approximately 70 of the dvds shipped during 2009 were titles with dvd release dates greater than 13 weeks 

growing scale we have achieved a level of scale in our business that provides many operational and competitive advantages from an operational perspective for example we are able to cost effectively automate many of our shipping and receiving processes helping to drive down unit shipping costs while also providing a better more consistent experience to our subscribers such scale economies also have contributed over time to expanding operating margins which has made it possible for netflix to aggressively price its service offering at levels difficult for competition to meet 

convenience selection and fast delivery subscribers can conveniently select titles by building and modifying a personalized queue of titles on our web site or by selecting titles directly from select netflix ready devices we create a unique experience for subscribers by generating user interfaces on our website and netflix ready devices that are tailored to subscribers’ individual rental and ratings history subscribers rate approximately 20 million movies a week and netflix has recorded more than 3 billion ratings to date based on each subscriber’s queue we ship dvds by first class mail and subscribers return these dvds to us in prepaid mailers after receipt of returned dvds we mail our subscribers the next available dvd in their queue of selected titles we have a vast array of titles on dvd and our nationwide network of distribution centers allows us to offer fast delivery in addition subscribers can select from a growing number of titles that can be watched instantly on their computers or tvs without commercial interruption the number of streaming content choices has grown approximately 30 over the year ended december 31 2009 and is expected to continue to grow rapidly for the foreseeable future 

growth strategy 

our core strategy to grow a large subscription business consisting of streaming and dvdbymail content includes the following key elements 

providing compelling value for subscribers for a low fixed monthly fee we provide subscribers access to a growing library of movies and tv episodes that can be watched instantly and a vast selection of dvd titles we quickly deliver dvds to subscribers from our shipping centers located throughout the united states by us mail subscribers can at no additional fee also stream movies and tv episodes to their computers and tvs there are no due dates no late fees no shipping fees and no payperview fees we merchandise titles in easytorecognize lists including new releases by genre and other targeted categories our recommendation and merchandising technology provides subscribers with individualized recommendations of titles from our library our convenient easytouse web site allows subscribers to quickly select current titles reserve upcoming releases and build an individual queue for future viewing 

utilizing technology to enhance subscriber experience and operate efficiently we utilize proprietary and other technology to manage the processing and distribution of dvds from our shipping centers and the delivery of streaming content over the internet our software and equipment automate the process of tracking and routing dvds to and from each of our shipping centers and allocate order responsibilities among them we continuously monitor test and seek to improve the efficiency of our distribution processing and inventory management systems as our subscriber base and shipping volume grows we operate a nationwide network of shipping centers and continue to develop this network to meet the demands of our operations we also utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream movies and tv episodes in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet 

building mutually beneficial relationships with entertainment video providers we have invested substantial resources in establishing strong ties with various entertainment video providers we maintain an 

  

office in beverly hills california in order to maintain effective working relationships with the major studios we obtain content through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements and license agreements we work with the content providers to determine which method of acquiring titles is the most beneficial for each party our growing subscriber base provides studios with an additional distribution outlet for popular movies and tv episodes as well as niche titles and programs 

expanding the number of devices capable of streaming video from netflix  we have engaged a number of consumer electronics partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices we currently offer subscribers the ability to stream content through their computers and other devices including the xbox 360 playstation3 internetconnected tvs and bluray players tivo and the roku video digital player we intend to broaden our partner relationships over time so that more devices such as the nintendo wii game console are capable of streaming content from netflix by providing consumers with a broad array of devices capable of streaming content from netflix we believe that we enhance the value of our service to subscribers as well as position ourselves for continued growth as the internet delivery of content becomes more popular 

our web site—wwwnetflixcom 

we apply substantial resources to develop and maintain technology to implement the features of our web site such as subscription account signup and management personalized movie merchandising inventory optimization and streaming content we believe that our web site provides our subscribers with an easytouse interface that enhances the value of our service we believe that our ability to personally merchandise our content through the web site optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation and merchandising technology each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber subscribers pay for our service by a credit or debit card we utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods throughout our web site we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities allowing us to continuously optimize our web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers we use random control testing extensively including testing service levels plans promotions and pricing 

merchandising 

we use our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology along with other data to determine which titles are presented to a subscriber in doing so we believe we provide our subscribers with a quick and personalized way to find titles they are more likely to enjoy while also effectively managing our inventory utilization our merchandising efforts are used throughout our web site to determine which titles are displayed to subscribers including the generation of lists of similar titles we believe our merchandising efforts create a powerful method for catalog browsing and efficient library utilization 

we also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy this information may include 

 

  

  

 marketing 

we use multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service online advertising is an important channel for acquiring subscribers we advertise our service online through such vehicles as paid search listings banner ads text links and permission based emails in addition we have an affiliate program 

  

whereby we make available webbased banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a selfassisted basis from our web site and place on their web sites we also engage our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service we also advertise our service on various regional and national tv and radio stations we use targeted solo direct mail shared mail and newspaper print advertising to acquire new subscribers we also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studios movies in netflix promotional advertising we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of wordofmouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs 

content acquisition 

we obtain content through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements and license agreements under our dvd and streaming revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment for a defined period of time either to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on content utilization after the revenue sharing period expires for a dvd we generally have the option of returning the dvd to the studio destroying the dvd or purchasing the dvd the principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio we also purchase dvds from various studios distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis under these arrangements we typically pay a per disc fee for each of the dvds we purchase for titles that are streamed to our subscribers we generally license the content directly from studios and distributors for a defined period of time following expiration of the license term we remove the content from our service unless we extend or renew the associated license agreement 

fulfillment operations 

we have allocated substantial resources to developing maintaining and testing the technology that helps us manage fulfillment and the integration of our web site transaction processing systems fulfillment operations inventory levels content delivery networks and coordination of our shipping centers we ship and receive dvds from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the united states we believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the customer experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our dvds through the us postal service we also utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream movies and tv episodes in high volume to our subscribers over the internet 

customer service 

we believe that our ability to establish and maintain longterm relationships with subscribers depends in part on the strength of our customer support and service operations as such we work on maintaining and improving the overall quality and level of customer service and support we provide to our subscribers our customer service center is located in hillsboro oregon and primarily handles subscriber inquiries by telephone in addition we continue to focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and providing certain selfservice features on our web site such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems we continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had 1883 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments as of december 31 2009 we had 2197 parttime and temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

intellectual property 

we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we have filed patents in the us and abroad while our patents 

  

are an important element of our business our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents we have registered trademarks and service marks for the netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks our software the content of our web site and other material which we create are protected by copyright we also protect certain details about our business methods processes and strategies as trade secrets and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 

our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming to date we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and knowhow to protect our intellectual property it is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage 

from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot assure that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute

 item 1a risk factors tableend if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful our revenues will be adversely affected 

we must continue to attract subscribers to our service our ability to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting viewing receiving and returning dvd and streaming titles including providing valuable recommendations through our recommendation and merchandising technology furthermore the relative service levels pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract subscribers competitors include dvd rental outlets and kiosk services video package providers with payperview and vod content online dvd subscription rental web sites entertainment video retail stores and internet movie and tv content providers if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract subscribers in addition many of our subscribers are rejoining our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract subscribers and as a result our revenues will be adversely affected 

if we experience excessive rates of churn our revenues and business will be harmed 

we must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently delivery takes too long the service is a poor value competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our churn will likely increase and our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

deterioration in the economy could impact our business 

netflix is an entertainment service and payment for our service may be considered discretionary on the part of many of our current and potential subscribers to the extent the overall economy continues to deteriorate such as in the case of a prolonged recession our business could be impacted as subscribers choose either to leave our service or reduce their service levels also efforts to attract new subscribers may be adversely impacted 

if the market segment for online dvd rentals saturates our business will be adversely affected 

the market segment for online dvd rental has grown significantly since inception some of the increasing growth can be attributed to changes in our service offering especially the ability of our subscribers to stream movies and tv episodes on their tvs and computers a decline in our rate of growth could indicate that the market segment for online dvd rentals is beginning to saturate while we believe that online dvd rentals will continue to grow for the foreseeable future if this market segment were to saturate our business would be adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

the market for inhome entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies for delivery of inhome entertainment video such as vod and internet delivery of content continue to receive considerable media and investor attention many of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and web site and systems development than we do there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current or new competitors at our existing pricing levels or at even lower price points in the future furthermore we may need to adjust the level of service provided to our subscribers andor incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate as a result of increased competition we may see a reduction in operating margins and market share 

if vod or other technologies are more widely adopted and supported as a method of content delivery our business could be adversely affected 

some digital cable providers and internet content providers have implemented technology referred to as vod this technology transmits movies and other entertainment content on demand with interactive capabilities such as start stop and rewind in addition other technologies have been developed that allow alternative means for consumers to receive and watch movies or other entertainment particularly over the internet and on devices such as cell phones although we are providing our own internetbased delivery of content allowing our subscribers to stream certain movies and tv episodes vod or other technologies may become more affordable and viable alternative methods of content delivery that are widely supported by studios and distributors and adopted by consumers if this happens more quickly than we anticipate or more quickly than our own internet delivery offerings or if other providers are better able to meet studio and consumer needs and expectations our business could be adversely affected 

if the popularity of the dvd format decreases our business could be adversely affected 

while the growth of dvd sales has slowed we believe that the dvd will be a valuable longterm consumer proposition and studio profit center however if dvd sales were to decrease because of a shift away from movie watching or because new or existing technologies were to become more popular at the expense of dvd enjoyment studios and retailers may reduce their support of the dvd format our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by the continued popularity of the dvd format and if such popularity wanes our subscriber growth may also slow 

if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine or if studios were to release or distribute titles on dvd in a manner that attempts to circumvent or limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected 

under us copyright law once a copyright owner sells a copy of his work the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy while the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work the copyright owner gives up his ability to control the fate of the work once it had been sold as such once a dvd is sold into the market those obtaining the dvd are permitted to resell it rent it or otherwise dispose of it if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine our ability to obtain content and then rent it could be adversely affected likewise if studios agree to limit the sale or distribution of their content in ways that try to limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected for example some studios have expressed a desire to delay the availability of new release dvds for rental for a brief period of time following the dvds release to the retail 

  

market and in connection therewith would prohibit certain of their wholesalers from selling to various rental outlets such as us and redbox in fact universal studios and twentieth century fox are engaged in litigation brought by redbox over this practice furthermore certain content owners from time to time have established exclusive rental windows with particular outlets this happened in late 2006 and again in late 2007 when blockbuster announced arrangements with certain content owners pursuant to which blockbuster would receive content on dvds for rental exclusively by blockbuster to the extent content is to be distributed exclusively and not to retail vendors or distributors we could be prevented from obtaining such content to the extent the content is also sold to retail vendors or distributors we would not be prohibited from obtaining and renting such content pursuant to the first sale doctrine nonetheless to the extent content owners do not distribute to us directly or through their wholesalers or otherwise establish exclusive rental windows it will impact our ability to obtain such content in the most efficient manner and in some cases in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand if such arrangements were to become more commonplace or if additional impediments to obtaining content were created our ability to obtain content could be impacted and our business could be adversely affected 

delayed availability of new release dvds for rental could adversely affect our business 

we recently entered into a licensing agreement with warner bros whereby we agreed not to rent new release warner bros dvds until twentyeight days after such dvds are first made available for retail sale we believe that this agreement and perhaps others like it will provide us with less expensive content as well as deeper copy depth thus improving both our business and consumer experience nonetheless it is possible that the delay in obtaining new release content both from warner bros and any other suppliers that may adopt similar licensing strategies could impact consumer perception of our service or otherwise negatively impact subscriber satisfaction if this were to happen our business could be adversely impacted 

if studios were to offer new releases of entertainment video to other distribution channels prior to or on parity with the release on dvd our business could be adversely affected 

except for theatrical release dvds currently enjoy a competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early distribution window on the dvd format the window for new releases on dvd is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview internet delivery premium tv basic cable and network and syndicated tv the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies and the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel are determined solely by the studio releasing the title over the past several years the major studios have shortened the release windows and several studios have released movies simultaneously on dvd and vod if other distribution channels were to receive priority over or parity with dvd and such practices are widely adopted our subscribers might find these other distribution channels of more value than our service and our business could be adversely affected 

we depend on studios and distributors to license us content that we can stream instantly over the internet 

streaming content over the internet involves the licensing of rights which are separate from and independent of the rights we acquire when obtaining dvd content our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch instantly therefore depends on studios and distributors licensing us content specifically for internet delivery the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios and distributors change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to provide us licenses our ability to stream content to our subscribers will be adversely affected unlike dvd streaming content is not subject to the first sale doctrine as such we are completely dependent on the studio or distributor providing us licenses in order to access and stream content many of the licenses provide for the studios or distributor to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice for example in december 2008 certain content associated with our license from the starz play service was withdrawn on short notice in addition the studios have great 

  

flexibility in licensing content they may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming content for example hbo licenses content from studios like warner bros and the license provides hbo with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services including netflix as such netflix cannot license certain warner bros content for delivery to its subscribers while warner bros may nonetheless license the same content to transactional vod providers if we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us our ability to stream movies and tv episodes to our subscribers will be adversely impacted and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be adversely impacted during the course of our license relationship various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted 

we rely upon a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices 

we currently offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their pcs macs and other devices including internetconnected bluray players and tvs digital video players and game consoles we intend to broaden our capability to instantly stream movies and tv episodes to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our consumer electronics partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our subscribers use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

if we experience increased demand for titles which we are unable to offset with increased subscriber retention or operating margins our operating results may be adversely affected 

with our unlimited plans there is no established limit to the number of movies and tv episodes that subscribers may rent on dvd or watch instantly we are continually adjusting our service in ways that may impact subscriber content usage such adjustments include new web site features and merchandising practices improvements in the technology that enable subscribers to instantly watch movies and tv episodes an expanded dvd distribution network and software and process changes in addition demand for titles may increase for a variety of reasons beyond our control including promotion by studios and seasonal variations or shifts in consumer content watching 

if our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of any increased operating costs associated with increased usage our operating results will be adversely affected in addition our subscriber growth and retention may be adversely affected if we attempt to alter our service or increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles 

if our subscribers select titles or formats that are more expensive for us to obtain and deliver more frequently our expenses may increase 

certain titles cost us more to purchase or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from which they are obtained and the terms on which they are obtained if subscribers select these titles 

  

more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected our revenue sharing and other content acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected in addition films released on bluray and those released for streaming may be more expensive to obtain than in the standard definition dvd format the rate of customer acceptance and adoption of these new formats is uncertain if subscribers select these formats on a proportional basis more often than the existing standard definition dvd format our content acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected 

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we must continue to build and maintain strong brand identity to succeed we must continue to attract and retain a large number of subscribers who have relied on other rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service in addition we may have to compete for subscribers against other brands which have greater recognition than ours we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will only increase in light of competition both for online subscription services and other means of distributing titles such as vod from time to time our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among other things our inventory allocation delivery processing and service interruptions furthermore third party devices that enable instant streaming of movies and tv episodes from netflix may not meet consumer expectations to the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including paid search listings banner ads text links and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program we also engage our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including tv and radio advertising direct mail and print campaigns consumer package and mailing insertions we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership we maintain an active public relations program to increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide to enter our business or a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such channels in addition if ad rates increase we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our cost per subscriber laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of email and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

  

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be adversely affected 

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 many of our systems and operational practices were implemented when we were at a smaller scale of operations also as we grow we have implemented new systems and software to help run our operations if we are not able to refine or revise our legacy systems or implement new systems and software as we grow if they fail or if in responding to any other issues related to growth our management is materially distracted from our current operations our business may be adversely affected 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations including streaming of movies and tv episodes to our subscribers and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we use complex proprietary and other technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations including streaming of movies and tv episodes to our subscribers we continually enhance or modify the technology used for our distribution operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of dvds among our shipping centers or the streaming of movies and tv episodes to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired in addition if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired also any harm to our subscribers’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather natural disasters labor activism health epidemics or bioterrorism our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage and theft during our processing of shipments as well as during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage and theft rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit 

increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on may 12 2008 to 42 cents and again in may 2009 to 44 cents it is expected that the us postal service will raise rates again in subsequent years in accordance with the powers given the us postal service in connection with the 2007 postal reform legislation however in october 2009 the us postal service announced that it would not raise rates in 2010 the us postal service continues to focus on plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds and our gross margin could be adversely affected for example the office of inspector general “oig” at the us postal service issued a report in november 2007 recommending that the us postal service revise the machinability qualifications for 

  

first class mail related to dvds or to charge dvd mailers who don’t comply with the new regulations a 17 cent surcharge on all mail deemed unmachinable in addition a bymail game rental company filed a complaint with the postal regulatory commission alleging that the us postal service unreasonably discriminated against it in favor of netflix and blockbuster to the extent this proceeding was to result in operational or regulatory changes impacting our mail processing our gross margins and business operations could be adversely affected we do not anticipate any material impact to our operational practices or postage delivery rates arising from the oig report or the proceeding also if the us postal service curtails its services such as by closing facilities or discontinuing or reducing saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be adversely affected 

studios also release films in high definition format on bluray this high definition format dvd has higher damage rates than we currently experience with standard definition dvds if we were to see a significant increase in the number of bluray dvds we ship or an increase in the percentage of bluray dvds our subscribers take and the damage rates remained higher than standard definition dvds our gross margins profitability and cash flow could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation and merchandising technology our business may suffer 

our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation and merchandising technology to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure that our recommendation and merchandising technology will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

we are continually refining our recommendation and merchandising technology in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements in addition we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation technology 

if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

 

  

  

 if we do not acquire sufficient dvd titles our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we do not acquire sufficient copies of dvds either by not correctly anticipating demand or by intentionally acquiring fewer copies than needed to fully satisfy demand we may not appropriately satisfy subscriber demand and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be adversely affected conversely if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be adversely affected our ability to accurately predict subscriber demand as well as market factors such as exclusive distribution arrangements may impact our ability to acquire appropriate quantities of certain dvds 

  

if we are unable to renew or renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us or if the cost of obtaining titles on a wholesale basis increases our gross margins may be adversely affected 

we obtain dvds through a mix of revenue sharing agreements and direct purchases the type of agreement depends on the economic terms we can negotiate as well as studio preferences we have entered into numerous revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors which typically enabled us to increase our copy depth of dvds on an economical basis because of a low initial payment with additional payments made only if our subscribers rent the dvd during the course of our revenue sharing relationships various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted 

as the revenue sharing agreements expire we must renegotiate new terms or shift to direct purchasing arrangements under which we must pay the full wholesale price regardless of whether the dvd is rented if we cannot renegotiate purchasing on favorable terms the cost of obtaining content could increase and our gross margins may be adversely affected in addition the risk associated with accurately predicting title demand could increase if we are required to directly purchase more titles 

if the sales price of dvds to retail consumers decreases our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

the cost of manufacturing dvds is substantially less than the price for which new dvds are generally sold in the retail market thus we believe that studios and other resellers of dvds have significant flexibility in pricing dvds for retail sale if the retail price of dvds decreases significantly consumers may choose to purchase dvds instead of subscribing to our service 

any significant disruption in our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business 

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site or a netflix ready device our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general including discriminatory network management practices could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to fulfill dvd selections or deliver streaming content for example in august 2008 we suffered a service interruption that impacted our ability to ship and receive dvds as well as stream movies to our subscribers much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

our servers and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services in certain instances we have voluntarily provided affected subscribers with a credit during periods of extended outage any significant disruption to our service or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a thirdparty web hosting provider we recently have begun utilizing thirdparty internetbased or “cloud” computing systems in connection with our business operations also we utilize thirdparty content delivery networks to help us stream movies and tv episodes in high volume to netflix subscribers over the internet fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business in addition problems faced by our third party web hosting cloud computing or content delivery network providers including technological or businessrelated disruptions could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers 

in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations could be adversely affected 

our executive offices and data centers are located in the san francisco bay area we have shipping centers located throughout the united states including earthquake and hurricanesensitive areas our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of these natural disasters as well as from electrical blackouts fires floods power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations to handle disruptions in service arising from these events because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our executive offices and data centers we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes and may not have adequate insurance to cover losses and expenses from other natural disasters 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and our disclosure of or unauthorized access to subscriber data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendations we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if unauthorized access to our subscriber data were to occur or if we were to disclose data about our subscribers in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results 

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our subscriber data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our subscribers including names and mailing addresses with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data if despite these measures we or our payment processing service experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers we could face legal claims and our business could be adversely affected similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

in addition because we obtain subscribers’ billing information on our web site we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when 

  

the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory and streaming typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

increases in payment processing fees or changes to operating rules would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit cards our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to rules regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods which are predominately credit cards and debit cards these rules regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and from time to time we expect to file for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site our recommendation and merchandising technology title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant 

  

resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site or our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

if we become subject to liability for content that we distribute through our service our results of operations would be adversely affected 

as a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations we cannot assure that we are adequately insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change or if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

the manner in which internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet including laws limiting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business 

  

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs 

changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and recently enacted rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission have increased and may continue to increase our expenses as we devote resources to their requirements 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

we issued 200 million in a debt offering and may incur additional debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of december 31 2009 we have 200 million in 850 senior notes outstanding risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet certain covenants the failure to comply with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses any failure to comply with the restrictions of any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements 

risks related to our stock ownership 

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over netflix 

as of december 31 2009 our executive officers and directors their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 23 of our outstanding common stock and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days in particular jay hoag one of our directors beneficially owned approximately 14 and reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board beneficially owned approximately 6 these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from other stockholders and will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded since our may 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we record substantial stock compensation expenses related to our issuance of stock options and shares under our employee share purchase program that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

our stockbased compensation expenses totaled 126 million 123 million and 120 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we expect our stockbased compensation expenses will continue to be significant in future periods which will have an adverse impact on our operating results the latticebinomial model used to value our stock option grants and the blackscholes models used to value shares granted under our employee share purchase program both require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the price volatility of the underlying stock if facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future period expenses may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect the fair value estimate of stockbased payments our operating income net income and net income per share 

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues gross margin operating expenses number of paying subscribers number of dvds shipped per day and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

our business 

with more than 12 million subscribers we are the world’s largest subscription service streaming movies and tv episodes over the internet and sending dvds by mail our subscribers can instantly watch unlimited movies and tv episodes streamed to their tvs and computers and can receive dvds delivered quickly to their homes we offer a variety of subscription plans with no due dates no late fees no shipping fees and no payperview fees aided by our proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology subscribers can select from a growing library of titles that can be watched instantly and a vast array of titles on dvd on average approximately 2 million discs are shipped daily from our distribution centers across the united states additionally more than 48 of our subscribers instantly watched more than 15 minutes of streaming content in the fourth quarter of 2009 

subscribers can 

 

  

 our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of streaming and dvdby–mail content by combining streaming and dvd as part of the netflix subscription we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely compelling selection of movies for one low monthly price we believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service this advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the internet from competing services by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand distribution and our proprietary merchandising platform despite the growing popularity of internet delivered content we expect that the standard definition dvd along with its high definition successor bluray collectively referred to as “dvd” will continue to be the primary means by which a majority of netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future however at some point in the future we expect that internet delivery of content to the home will surpass dvd as the primary means by which most netflix subscribers view content

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

content accounting 

we obtain content through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements and license agreements with studios distributors and other suppliers dvd content is obtained through direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements streaming content is generally licensed for a fixed fee for the term of the license agreement but may also be obtained through a revenue sharing agreement 

we acquire dvd content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such we consider our direct purchase dvd library to be a productive asset accordingly we classify our dvd library as a noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheets additionally cash outflows for the acquisition of the dvd library net of changes in related accounts payable are classified as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows this is inclusive of any upfront nonrefundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements 

we amortize our direct purchase dvds less estimated salvage value on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives the useful life of the newrelease dvds and backcatalog dvds is estimated to be one year and three years respectively in estimating the useful life of our dvds we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives a salvage value is provided for those dvds that we do not expect to sell no salvage value is provided we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvds 

  

additionally the terms of certain dvd direct purchase agreements with studios and distributors provide for volume purchase discounts or rebates based on achieving specified performance levels volume purchase discounts are recorded as a reduction of dvd library when earned we accrue for rebates as earned based on historical title performance and estimates of demand for the titles over the remainder of the title term 

we obtain content distribution rights in order to stream movies and tv episodes without commercial interruption to subscribers’ computers and tvs via netflix ready devices we account for streaming content in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 920 entertainment—broadcasters  cash outflows associated with the streaming content are classified as cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we classify our streaming content obtained through a license agreement as either a current or noncurrent asset in the consolidated balance sheets based on the estimated time of usage after certain criteria have been met including availability of the streaming content for its first showing we amortize licensed streaming content on a straightline basis generally over the term of the related license agreements or the title’s window of availability 

we also obtain dvd and streaming content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on utilization for a defined period of time or the title term which typically ranges from six to twelve months for each title the initial cost may be in the form of an upfront nonrefundable payment this payment is capitalized in the content library in accordance with our dvd and streaming content policies as applicable the initial cost may also be in the form of a prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense the terms of some revenue sharing agreements with studios obligate us to make minimum revenue sharing payments for certain titles we amortize minimum revenue sharing prepayments or accrete an amount payable to studios if the payment is due in arrears as revenue sharing obligations are incurred a provision for estimated shortfall if any on minimum revenue sharing payments is made in the period in which the shortfall becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated under the revenue sharing agreements for our dvd library at the end of the title term we generally have the option of returning the dvd to the studio destroying the dvd or purchasing the dvd 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period 

we calculate the fair value of new stockbased compensation awards under our stock option plans using a latticebinomial model we use a blackscholes model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares these models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

  

 we grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis we have elected to grant all options as nonqualified stock options which vest immediately as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation 

  

expense is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for postvesting option forfeitures we also issue shares through our employee stock purchase program “espp” which has been determined to be compensatory in nature stockbased compensation expense for shares issued under this program is expensed over the offering period of six months 

our stockbased compensation expenses totaled 126 million 123 million and 120 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively as a result of changes in our compensation structure and related employee elections for 2010 resulting in an increase in the number of options granted to employees we expect our stockbased compensation expense for 2010 and future periods will increase significantly see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about stock based compensation 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying the enacted tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 revenues 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably over each subscriber’s monthly subscription period we record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues we currently generate all our revenues in the united states although we plan to launch a limited international expansion with a streaming subscription service in 2010 

we offer a variety of subscription plans combining streaming movies and tv episodes over the internet and sending dvds by mail the price per plan varies based on the number of dvds that a subscriber has out at any given point and based on whether the service has limited or unlimited usage all of our unlimited plans allow the subscriber unlimited streaming to their computer or netflix ready device the vast majority of our subscriber base has chosen a 1 2 or 3out unlimited plan customers electing access to the high definition bluray discs in addition to standard definition dvds pay a surcharge ranging from 1 to 4 for our most popular plans pricing of our plans is as follows 

 

   

 the 3056 million increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 266 growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the compelling value proposition of streaming and dvds by mail for one low price and other benefits of our service this increase was offset in part by a 33 decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans the total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2out plans grew by 481 as compared to a 11 decline in all other plans during the year ended december 31 2009 

 

 the 1593 million increase in our revenues was primarily a result of the 231 growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the compelling value proposition of streaming and dvds by mail for one low price and other benefits of our service this increase was offset in part by an 80 decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber resulting from the continued growth in our lower priced subscription plans as well as a price reduction for our most popular subscription plans during the third quarter of 2007 the total number of average paying subscribers in our 1 and 2out plans grew by 398 as compared to 61 in all other plans during the year ended december 31 2008 

until the average price paid by our new subscriber additions is equal to the average price paid by existing subscribers we expect our average monthly revenue per paying subscriber will continue to decline as the lower priced plans grow as a percentage of our subscriber base this decline could be partially offset by the growth in the number of subscribers electing to receive bluray discs for a surcharge as described above our revenues and average monthly revenue per paying subscriber could be impacted by future changes to our pricing structure which may result from competitive effects that we are unable to predict 

the following table presents our yearend subscriber information 

 

   

cost of revenues 

cost of subscription 

cost of subscription revenues consists of content delivery costs related to shipping dvds and providing streaming content to subscribers as well as expenses related to the acquisition of content costs related to freetrial periods are allocated to marketing expenses 

content delivery expenses consist of the postage costs to mail dvds to and from our paying subscribers the packaging and label costs for the mailers and all costs associated with streaming content over the internet we utilize third party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream content in high volume to our subscribers over the internet 

content acquisition expenses consist of costs incurred in obtaining content such as amortization of content and revenue sharing expense we obtain content from studios distributors and other suppliers through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements and license agreements 

 

 the 1483 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors 

 

  

  

 the 967 million increase in cost of subscription revenues was due to the following factors 

 

  

   

fulfillment expenses 

fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our shipping and customer service centers including costs attributable to receiving inspecting and warehousing our content library fulfillment expenses also include credit card fees 

 

 the 207 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following 

 

  

  

 the 273 million increase in fulfillment expenses was due to the following 

 

  

 gross margin 

 

 the 21 increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower dvd content acquisition expenses per dvd mailed and a 63 decline in monthly dvd rentals per average paying subscriber driven by the growing popularity of our lower priced plans this decline was higher than the decline in average revenue per paying subscriber of 33 this was offset partially by increased investments in our streaming content 

 

 the 15 decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in postage rates effective may 2008 and a reduction in the prices of our most popular subscription plans during the second half of 2007 

  

we expect to continue to make substantial investments in our content library and in particular may increase spending associated with streaming content these investments would reduce our gross margin to the extent that increases outpace growth in our revenues 

operating expenses 

technology and development 

technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in testing maintaining and modifying our web site our recommendation and merchandising technology developing solutions for streaming content to subscribers telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internaluse software systems technology and development expenses also include depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our web site and store our data 

 

 the 247 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 174 million increase in personnelrelated costs due to 266 growth in headcount to develop solutions for streaming content and continued improvements to our service the increase is also partly due to a 67 million increase in facilities and equipment expenses to support the increased headcount and overall growth of operations 

 

 the 189 million increase in technology and development expenses was primarily the result of a 104 million increase in personnelrelated costs due to 280 growth in headcount and an 85 million increase in other expenses to develop solutions for streaming content and continued improvements to our service 

marketing 

marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our affiliates including consumer electronics partners advertising expenses include marketing program expenditures and other promotional activities including allocated costs of revenues relating to free trial periods also included in marketing expense are payroll related expenses 

 

 the 380 million increase in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase of 214 million in spending related to affiliates including our consumer electronics partners the increase is also due to an 

  

115 million increase in marketing program spending principally in tv and radio advertising and direct mail to promote our hybrid service of streaming content and dvds by mail subscriber acquisition cost decreased primarily due to momentum associated with the launch of new consumer electronics partner devices and the broad appeal of streaming content 

 

 the 185 million decrease in marketing expenses was primarily attributable to a 342 million decrease in marketing program spending principally in direct mail and inserts offset partially by an increase of 115 million in spending related to affiliates including our consumer electronics partners in the second half of 2007 we lowered prices on our most popular subscription plans and decided to partially offset the cost of our investment in lower prices by reducing our spending on marketing programs the decrease was partially offset by higher personnelrelated costs due to higher headcount and an increase in the costs of free trial periods due to the 284 increase in gross subscriber additions subscriber acquisition cost decreased in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to more efficient marketing spending 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive finance content acquisition and administrative personnel as well as recruiting professional fees and other general corporate expenses 

 

 the 17 million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 74 million increase in legal costs offset partially by a 27 million decrease in costs related to our subsidiary red envelope entertainment a 21 million release of accruals in 2009 associated with a former class action suit that was settled in 2008 and decreases in personnelrelated costs 

 

 the 27 million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 26 million decrease in costs related to our subsidiary red envelope entertainment as well as a 32 million decrease in legal costs these decreases were partially offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs due to a 96 increase in headcount 

  

gain on disposal of dvds 

gain on disposal of dvds represents the difference between proceeds from sales of dvds and associated cost of dvd sales cost of dvd sales includes the net book value of the dvds sold shipping charges and where applicable a contractually specified fee for the dvds that are subject to revenue sharing agreements 

 

 the 18 million decrease in gain on disposal of dvds was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of retail sales of previously viewed dvds to subscribers in the first quarter of 2009 we continue to sell previously viewed dvds through wholesale channels and expect our future gains to continue to be insignificant in relation to our overall operations 

 

 the 09 million decrease in gain on disposal of dvds in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to a decrease in the sales price of dvds 

gain on legal settlement 

on june 25 2007 we resolved a pending patent litigation with blockbuster inc as part of the settlement we received a onetime payment of 70 million during the second quarter of 2007 

interest expense 

interest expense consists of the interest on our lease financing obligations and the interest on our 850 senior notes including the amortization of debt issuance costs also in the fourth quarter of 2009 we expensed the debt issuance costs related to our line of credit 

in june 2004 and june 2006 we entered into two separate lease arrangements whereby we leased a building that was constructed by a third party as discussed in note 5 of the consolidated financial statements we have accounted for these leases in accordance with asc topic 84040 leases—saleleaseback transactions as it applies to situations in which an entity is involved with the construction funding of an asset that will be leased when the construction project is completed this guidance requires netflix to be considered the owner for accounting purposes of the two buildings 

  

accordingly we have recorded assets on our balance sheet for the costs paid by our lessor to construct our headquarters facilities along with corresponding financing liabilities for amounts equal to these lessorpaid construction costs the monthly rent payments we make to our lessor under our lease agreements are recorded in our financial statements as land lease expense and principal and interest on the financing liabilities interest expense on lease financing obligations reflects the portion of our monthly lease payments that is allocated to interest expense 

 

 the 40 million increase in interest expense is entirely attributable to the interest expense associated with our 850 senior notes and line of credit interest expense in 2009 includes 28 million for our lease financing obligations 26 million of interest payments due on our notes and 11 million of amortization of debt issuance costs 

 

 the 13 million increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the interest on our lease financing obligations arising when the lease term for the second of our headquarter buildings commenced 

interest and other income expense 

interest and other income expense consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from invested cash and shortterm investments 

 

 the 57 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily attributable to lower cash and investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock and a 16 million decrease in realized gains recognized as compared to the prior year the decrease was offset by a 18 million dollar gain realized in 2009 on the sale of our investment in a private company which we accounted for under the cost method 

 

 the 79 million decrease in interest and other income was primarily a result of the lower cash and investment balances resulting from the repurchase of our common stock the decrease was offset by a 24 million increase in realized gains 

  

interest and dividend income was approximately 37 million 92 million and 197 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively interest and other income included gains of approximately 15 million 31 million and 07 million on the sale of shortterm investments in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

provision for income taxes 

 

 in 2009 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes of 10 million or 5 of income before income tax this was partially offset by federal and california research and development “rd” tax credits of 2 million the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a cumulative benefit recorded as a discrete item in the second quarter of 2008 for prior period rd tax credits 

 

 in 2008 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes of 5 million or 4 of income before income tax this was partially offset by rd tax credits of 3 million the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a cumulative benefit recorded as a discrete item in the second quarter of 2008 for prior period rd tax credits 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001 many factors will impact our ability to continue to generate and grow cash from our operations including but not limited to the price of our service the number of subscribers who sign up for our service and the growth or reduction in our subscriber base 

in september 2009 we entered into a credit agreement which provided for a 100 million threeyear revolving credit facility in october 2009 the company borrowed 20 million under the credit agreement in november 2009 we issued 200 million of our 850 senior notes due in 2017 in connection with the notes offering we repaid all outstanding amounts under our credit agreement and terminated it although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with our available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 

our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations additionally debt financing has also been a source of liquidity in fiscal 2009 our primary uses of cash include our stock repurchase programs shipping and packaging expenses the acquisition of content capital expenditures related to information technology and automation equipment for operations marketing and fulfillment expenses 

in addition on august 6 2009 we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program through the end of 2010 allowing us to repurchase 300 million of our common stock of which we have purchased 1491 million as of december 31 2009 subsequent to december 31 2009 we purchased an 

  

additional 624 million of our common stock under the program the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions the following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 operating activities 

during 2009 our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of 1159 million increased by noncash adjustments of 2549 million and offset by a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 457 million the majority of the noncash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of 2195 million which increased by 97 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to support our larger subscriber base the decrease in cash flow attributable to the net changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by acquisitions of content library related to our streaming content as we continued to increase our investments in streaming content in 2009 cash provided by operating activities increased 410 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 this was primarily due to an increase in net income of 328 million increased noncash adjustments of 273 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 191 million 

during 2008 our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of 830 million increased by noncash adjustments of 2276 million offset by a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 266 million the majority of the noncash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of 2098 million which increased by 63 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to support our larger subscriber base the decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by acquisitions of content library related to our streaming content as we continued to increase our investments in streaming content in 2008 cash provided by operating activities increased 66 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 this was primarily due to an increase in net income of 164 million increased noncash adjustments of 323 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 421 million 

investing activities 

our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases sales and maturities of availableforsale securities acquisitions of dvd content library and purchases of property and equipment cash used in investing activities increased 1011 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 this increase was primarily driven by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 1050 million offset partially by a decrease in the purchases of short term investments of 290 million in addition acquisitions of dvds increased by 302 million 

cash used in investing activities decreased 2911 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the purchases of shortterm investments of 1484 million coupled with an increase in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 1065 million in addition acquisitions of dvds decreased by 458 million as more dvds were obtained through revenue sharing agreements in 2008 

  

financing activities 

our financing activities consist primarily of issuance of debt repurchases of our common stock issuance of common stock and the excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation cash used by financing activities decreased by 920 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to the 1939 million net proceeds received from the issuance of our 850 senior notes and a 164 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock through option exercises and through our employee stock purchase plan in addition the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation increased by 75 million in 2009 these cash inflows were offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock of 1244 million 

cash used by financing activities increased by 1122 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in stock repurchases of 1000 million in addition the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation decreased by 210 million in 2008 as remaining benefits from net operating losses were utilized this use of cash was offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of 93 million 

contractual obligations 

for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2009 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2009 in thousands 

 

  

 as of december 31 2009 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 132 million and an additional 09 million for gross interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

license agreements 

in addition to the above contractual obligations we have certain license agreements with studios that include a maximum number of titles that we may or may not receive in the future access to these titles is based on the discretion of the studios and as such we may not receive these titles if we did receive access to the maximum number of titles we would incur up to an additional 6 million in commitments during 2010 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not engaged in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities accordingly our operating results financial condition and cash flows are not presently subject to offbalance sheet risks 

  

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in these circumstances payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract further our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and in some instances we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers the terms of such obligations vary

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 

as of december 31 2009 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2009 our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities approximately 52 of the portfolio is invested in government and agency issued securities 

at december 31 2009 we had securities classified as shortterm investments of 1860 million changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 

 

 a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2009 the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

  

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values in  thousands of our debt securities classified as shortterm investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the analysis is shown as of december 31 2009

 item 1 business tableend with more than 10 million subscribers we are the largest online movie rental subscription service in the united states we offer a variety of subscription plans with no due dates no late fees no shipping fees and no payperview fees we provide subscribers access to over 100000 dvd and bluray titles plus more than 12000 streaming content choices subscribers select titles at our web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service and merchandising tools subscribers can 

 

  

 our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of dvd by mail and streaming content we offer over 100000 titles on dvd in comparison the 12000 content choices available for streaming are relatively limited we expect to substantially broaden the content choices as more content becomes available to us until such time by bundling dvd and streaming as part of the netflix subscription we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely comprehensive selection of movies for one low monthly price we believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service this advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the internet from competing services by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand distribution and our proprietary merchandising platform despite the growing popularity of internet delivered content we expect that the standard definition dvd along with its high definition successor bluray collectively referred to in this annual report as “dvd” will continue to be the primary means by which most netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future however at some point in the future we expect that internet delivery of content to the home will surpass dvd 

we promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs including online promotions television and radio advertising package inserts direct mail and other promotions with third parties these programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period at the end of the free trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers unless they cancel their subscription all paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance 

  

we stock over 100000 dvd titles we have established revenue sharing relationships with several studios and distributors we also purchase titles directly from studios distributors and other suppliers in addition we have more than 12000 content choices licensed for streaming 

we ship and receive dvds throughout the united states we maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allows us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers 

we are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements 

we are organized in a single operating segment all our revenues are generated in the united states and we have no longlived assets outside the united states substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees 

industry overview 

motion pictures including movies and television programs “entertainment video” are distributed broadly through a variety of channels including movie theaters airlines hotels and inhome inhome distribution channels include dvd rental and retail outlets and web sites cable satellite and telecommunication providers offering basic and premium television payperview and videoondemand “vod” and internet delivery currently studios distribute their entertainment video content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market three to seven months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to premium television and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and network television internet delivered content is made available typically at the same time as payperview or vod however some content such as television shows are often made available for internet viewing shortly after the original airing date the major studios and television networks have continued to experiment with shortened release windows and we anticipate that they will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional windows including releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod we believe however that dvd will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits dvd generates for the studios in the near term 

challenges faced by consumers in selecting inhome entertainment video 

the continued proliferation of new releases of entertainment video coupled with the availability of a large and growing back catalog of titles on dvd create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles 

first despite the large number of available titles on dvd existing subscription channels and traditional dvd rental outlets stock a limited selection of titles frustrating consumer demand for more choice subscription channels payperview and vod services continue to offer a relatively narrow selection of titles likewise traditional dvd rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles we believe our selection of over 100000 titles on dvd offers an attractive alternative to these traditional channels 

second even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service our merchandising practices and our other web site features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences 

  

competitive strengths 

we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths 

 

  

  

  

 growth strategy 

our core strategy to grow a large subscription business consisting of dvd by mail and streaming content includes the following key elements 

 

   

  

 our web site—wwwnetflixcom 

we apply substantial resources to develop and maintain technology to implement the features of our web site such as subscription account signup and management personalized movie merchandising inventory optimization and streaming content we believe that our web site provides our subscribers with an easytouse interface that enhances the value of our service we believe that our ability to personally merchandise our content through the web site optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber subscribers pay for our service by a credit or debit card we utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods throughout our web site we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities allowing us to continuously optimize our web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers we use random control testing extensively including testing service levels plans promotions and pricing 

merchandising 

we use our proprietary recommendation service along with other data such as viewing history and inventory levels to determine which titles are presented to a subscriber in doing so we believe we provide our subscribers with a quick and personalized way to find titles they are more likely to enjoy while also effectively managing our inventory utilization our merchandising efforts are used throughout our website to determine which titles are displayed to subscribers including the generation of lists of similar titles we believe our merchandising efforts create a powerful method for catalog browsing and efficient library utilization 

we also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy this information may include 

 

  

  

 marketing 

we use multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service online advertising is an important channel for acquiring subscribers we advertise our service online through such vehicles as paid 

  

search listings banner ads text links and permission based emails in addition we have an affiliate program whereby we make available webbased banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a selfassisted basis from our web site and place on their web sites we also engage our consumer electronic partners to generate new subscribers for our service we also advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations we use targeted solo direct mail shared mail and newspaper print advertising to acquire new subscribers we also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studios movies in netflix promotional advertising we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of wordofmouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs 

content acquisition 

we obtain content through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements and license agreements under our dvd and streaming revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment for a defined period of time either to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on content utilization after the revenue sharing period expires for a dvd we generally have the option of returning the dvd to the studio destroying the dvd or purchasing the dvd the principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio we also purchase dvds from various studios distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis under these arrangements we typically pay a per disc fee for each of the dvds we purchase for titles that are streamed to our subscribers we generally license the content directly from studios and distributors for a defined period of time following expiration of the license term we remove the content from our service unless we extend or renew the associated license agreement 

fulfillment operations 

we currently stock over 100000 titles on more than 72 million dvds not all titles are available in both standard definition dvd and bluray formats we have allocated substantial resources to developing maintaining and testing the technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our web site transaction processing systems fulfillment operations inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers we ship and receive dvds from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the united states we believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the customer experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our dvds through the us postal service 

customer service 

we believe that our ability to establish and maintain longterm relationships with subscribers depends in part on the strength of our customer support and service operations as such we work on maintaining and improving the overall quality and level of customer service and support we provide to our subscribers our customer service center is located in hillsboro oregon and primarily handles subscriber inquiries by telephone in addition we continue to focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and providing certain selfservice features on our web site such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems we continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels 

competition 

the market for inhome entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome entertainment video providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to cable rent a dvd from redbox or blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart or amazon download a movie from apple itunes watch a television show on hulucom and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost dvds and internet 

  

delivery of content represent only two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing entertainment video in addition the growth in adoption of dvd and internet delivery of content is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies 

our principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

 while we anticipate that new devices and services for internet delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years we believe that dvd will continue to be an important part of the home entertainment experience for the foreseeable future however at some point in the future we expect that internet delivery of content directly to the home will surpass dvd 

we believe there will be three primary economic models for internet delivered content ad supported such as hulucom and youtube payperview or transactional such as amazon’s video on demand and apple itunes and subscription such as our service it is our intent to focus exclusively on the subscription segment of internet delivered content 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had 1644 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments as of december 31 2008 we had 1626 parttime and temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

intellectual property 

we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we have filed patents in the us and abroad in the us we were issued broad business method patents covering among other things our subscription rental service in 2003 and 2006 and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005 while our patents are an important element of our business our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents we have registered trademarks and service marks for the netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks our software the content of our web site and other material which we create are protected by copyright we also protect certain details about our business methods processes and strategies as trade secrets and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 

our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming to date we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and knowhow to protect our intellectual property it is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage 

from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot assure that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute

 item 1a risk factors tableend if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful our revenues will be adversely affected 

we must continue to attract subscribers to our service our ability to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting viewing receiving and returning titles including providing valuable recommendations through our recommendation service furthermore the relative service levels pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract subscribers competitors include movie retail stores dvd rental outlets and kiosk services internet content providers’ online dvd subscription rental web sites and video package providers with pay perview and vod content if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract subscribers in addition many of our subscribers are rejoining our service or originate from wordofmouth advertising from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract subscribers and as a result our revenues will be adversely affected 

if we experience excessive rates of churn our revenues and business will be harmed 

we must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently delivery takes too long the service is a poor value competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our churn will likely increase and our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

deterioration in the economy could impact our business 

netflix is an entertainment service and payment for our service may be considered discretionary on the part of many of our current and potential subscribers to the extent the overall economy continues to deteriorate such as in the case of a prolonged recession our business could be impacted as subscribers choose either to leave our service or reduce their service levels also efforts to attract new subscribers may be adversely impacted 

if the market segment for online dvd rentals saturates our business will be adversely affected 

the market segment for online dvd rental has grown significantly since inception some of the increasing growth can be attributed to changes in our service offering especially the ability of our subscribers to stream movies and tv episodes on their tvs pcs and macs fluctuations in our rate of growth could indicate that the market segment for online dvd rentals is beginning to saturate while we believe that online dvd rentals will continue to grow for the foreseeable future if this market segment were to saturate our business would be adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

the market for inhome entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies for delivery of inhome entertainment video such as vod and internet delivery of content continue to receive considerable media and investor attention many of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing web site and systems development than we do there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current or new competitors at our existing pricing levels or at even lower price points in the future furthermore we may need to adjust the level of service provided to our subscribers andor incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate as a result of increased competition we may see a reduction in operating margins and market share 

if vod or other technologies are more widely adopted and supported as a method of content delivery our business could be adversely affected 

some digital cable providers and internet content providers have implemented technology referred to as vod this technology transmits movies and other entertainment content on demand with interactive capabilities such as start stop and rewind in addition other technologies have been developed that allow alternative means for consumers to receive and watch movies or other entertainment particularly over the internet and on such devices as cell phones although we are providing our own internetbased delivery of content allowing our subscribers to stream certain movies and tv episodes vod or other technologies may become more affordable and viable alternative methods of content delivery that are widely supported by studios and distributors and adopted by consumers if this happens more quickly than we anticipate or more quickly than our own internet delivery offerings or if other providers are better able to meet studio and consumer needs and expectations our business could be adversely affected 

if the popularity of the dvd format decreases our business could be adversely affected 

while the growth of dvd sales has slowed we believe that the dvd will be a valuable longterm consumer proposition and studio profit center however if dvd sales were to decrease because of a shift away from movie watching or because new or existing technologies were to become more popular at the expense of dvd enjoyment studios and retailers may reduce their support of the dvd format our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by the continued popularity of the dvd format and if such popularity wanes our subscriber growth may also slow 

if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine or if studios were to release or distribute titles on dvd in a manner that attempts to circumvent or limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected 

under us copyright law once a copyright owner sells a copy of his work the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy while the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work the copyright owner gives up his ability to control the fate of the work once it had been sold as such once a dvd is sold into the market those obtaining the dvd are permitted to resell it rent it or otherwise dispose of it if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine our ability to obtain content and then rent it could be adversely affected likewise if studios agree to limit the sale or distribution of their content in ways that try to limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected for example in late 2006 and again in late 2007 blockbuster announced arrangements with certain content owners pursuant to which blockbuster would receive content on dvds for rental exclusively 

  

by blockbuster to the extent this content is to be distributed exclusively to blockbuster and not to retail vendors or distributors we could be prevented from obtaining such content to the extent the content is also sold to retail vendors or distributors we would not be prohibited from obtaining and renting such content pursuant to the first sale doctrine nonetheless it does impact our ability to obtain such content in the most efficient manner and in some cases in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand if such arrangements were to become more commonplace or if additional impediments to obtaining content were created such as an exclusive rental window our ability to obtain content could be impacted and our business could be adversely affected 

if studios were to offer new releases of entertainment video to other distribution channels prior to or on parity with the release on dvd our business could be adversely affected 

except for theatrical release dvds currently enjoy a competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early distribution window on the dvd format the window for new releases on dvd is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview internetdelivery premium television basic cable and network and syndicated television the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies and the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel are determined solely by the studio releasing the title over the past several years the major studios have shortened the release windows and several studios have released movies simultaneously on dvd and vod if other distribution channels were to receive priority over or parity with dvd and such practices are widely adopted our subscribers might find these other distribution channels of more value than our service and our business could be adversely affected 

we depend on studios and distributors to license us content that we can stream instantly over the internet 

streaming content over the internet involves the licensing of rights which are separate from and independent of the rights we acquire when obtaining dvd content our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch instantly therefore depends on studios and distributors licensing us content specifically for internet delivery the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary if the studios and distributors change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to provide us licenses our ability to stream content to our subscribers will be adversely affected unlike dvd streaming content is not subject to the first sale doctrine as such we are completely dependent on the studio or distributor providing us licenses in order to access and stream content many of the licenses provide for the studios or distributor to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice for example in december 2008 certain content associated with our license from the starz play service was withdrawn on short notice in addition the studios have great flexibility in licensing content they may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming content for example hbo licenses content from studios like warner bros and the license provides hbo with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services including netflix as such netflix cannot license certain warner bros content for delivery to its subscribers while warner bros may nonetheless license the same content to transactional vod providers this ability to carveup and maintain ongoing control over distribution rights including the ability to withdraw content is unique to streaming content if we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us our ability to stream movies and tv episodes to our subscribers will be adversely impacted and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be adversely impacted during the course of our license relationship various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted 

we intend to engage a number of partners to offer instant streaming of content from netflix to various devices 

we currently offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their pcs macs and other devices including the xbox 360 internet connected bluray players from lg electronics and samsung tivo 

  

and the netflix player by roku we intend to broaden our capability to instantly stream movies and tv episodes to other platforms and partners over time if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted our agreements with our consumer electronics partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if upon expiration our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us for example while the pc and mac platforms constitute the largest number of devices used by our subscribers to enjoy streaming content the agreement covering the next largest number of devices will expire in late 2009 unless the partner exercises its option to extend if such agreement were to terminate our subscriber acquisition and retention could be adversely impacted furthermore devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business in addition technology changes to our watch instantly functionality may require that partners update their devices if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices our service and our subscribers use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted 

if we experience increased demand for titles which we are unable to offset with increased subscriber retention or operating margins our operating results may be adversely affected 

with our unlimited plans there is no established limit to the number of movies and tv episodes that subscribers may rent on dvd or watch instantly we are continually adjusting our service in ways that may impact subscriber movie usage such adjustments include new web site features and merchandising practices improvements in the technology that enable subscribers to instantly watch movies and tv episodes an expanded dvd distribution network and software and process changes in addition demand for titles may increase for a variety of reasons beyond our control including promotion by studios and seasonal variations or shifts in consumer movie watching 

if our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of any increased operating costs associated with increased usage our operating results will be adversely affected in addition our subscriber growth and retention may be adversely affected if we attempt to alter our service or increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles 

if our subscribers select titles or formats that are more expensive for us to obtain and deliver more frequently our expenses may increase 

certain titles cost us more to purchase or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they are obtained and the terms on which they are obtained if subscribers select these titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected our revenue sharing and other content acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected in addition films released on bluray and those released for streaming may be more expensive to obtain than in the standard definition dvd format the rate of customer acceptance and adoption of these new formats is uncertain if subscribers select these formats on a proportional basis more often than the existing standard definition dvd format our content acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected 

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results may be adversely affected 

we must continue to build and maintain strong brand identity to succeed we must continue to attract and retain a large number of subscribers who have relied on other rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our 

  

service in addition we may have to compete for subscribers against other brands which have greater recognition than ours we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will only increase in light of competition both for online subscription services and other means of distributing titles such as vod from time to time our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among other things our inventory allocation delivery processing and service interruptions furthermore third party devices that enable instant streaming of movies and tv episodes from netflix may not meet consumer expectations to the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including paid search listings banner ads text links and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program we also engage our consumer electronics partners to generate new subscribers for our service in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including television and radio advertising direct mail and print campaigns consumer package and mailing insertions we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership we maintain an active public relations program to increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide to enter our business or a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such channels in addition if ad rates increase we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our cost per subscriber laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of email and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be adversely affected 

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 many of our systems and operational practices were implemented when we were at a smaller scale of operations also as we grow we have implemented new systems and software to help run our operations if we are not able to refine or revise our legacy systems or implement new systems and software as we grow if they fail or if in responding to any other issues related to growth our management is materially distracted from our current operations our business may be adversely affected 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations including streaming of movies and tv episodes to our subscribers and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we use complex proprietary and other technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations including streaming of movies and tv episodes to our subscribers this 

  

technology including equipment and related software is intended to allow our nationwide network of shipping centers to be operated on an integrated basis we continually enhance or modify the technology used for our distribution operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of dvds among our shipping centers in a timely and efficient manner our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired in addition our subscribers may instantly watch movies and tv episodes but they must maintain their connection to our service for an uninterrupted viewing experience if our software fails to satisfactorily display the available titles our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired also any harm to our subscribers’ personal computers or other devices caused by the proprietary software could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather natural disasters labor activism health epidemics or bioterrorism our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage and theft during our processing of shipments as well as during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage and theft rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit 

increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on may 12 2008 to 42 cents the us postal service has announced an increase in the rate for first class postage effective in may 2009 by 2 cents to 44 cents and it is also expected that the us postal service will raise rates again in subsequent years in accordance with the powers given the us postal service in connection with the 2007 postal reform legislation the us postal service continues to focus on plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds and our gross margin could be adversely affected for example the office of inspector general at the us postal service issued a report in november 2007 recommending that the us postal service revise the machinability qualifications for first class mail related to dvds or to charge dvd mailers who don’t comply with the new regulations a 17 cent surcharge on all mail deemed unmachinable we do not anticipate any material impact to our operational practices or postage delivery rates arising from this report also if the us postal service curtails its services such as by closing facilities or discontinuing or reducing saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be adversely affected 

studios have begun to release films in high definition format on bluray this new high definition format dvd has higher damage rates than we currently experience with standard definition dvds if we were to see a significant increase in the number of bluray dvds we ship or an increase in the percentage of bluray dvds our subscribers take and the damage rates remained higher than standard definition dvds our gross margins profitability and cash flow could be adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation service our business may suffer 

based on proprietary algorithms our recommendation service enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation service to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure that the proprietary algorithms in our recommendation service will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

we are continually refining our recommendation service in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements in addition we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation service 

if our recommendation service does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

 

  

  

 if we do not acquire sufficient dvd titles our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we do not acquire sufficient copies of dvds either by not correctly anticipating demand or by intentionally acquiring fewer copies than needed to fully satisfy demand we may not appropriately satisfy subscriber demand and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be adversely affected conversely if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be adversely affected our ability to accurately predict subscriber demand as well as market factors such as exclusive distribution arrangements may impact our ability to acquire appropriate quantities of certain dvds 

if we are unable to renew or renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us or if the cost of obtaining titles on a wholesale basis increases our gross margins may be adversely affected 

we obtain dvds through a mix of revenue sharing agreements and direct purchases the type of agreement depends on the economic terms we can negotiate as well as studio preferences we have entered into numerous revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors which typically enabled us to increase our copy depth of dvds on an economical basis because of a low initial payment with additional payments made only if our subscribers rent the dvd during the course of our revenue sharing relationships various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted 

as the revenue sharing agreements expire we must renegotiate new terms or shift to direct purchasing arrangements under which we must pay the full wholesale price regardless of whether the dvd is rented if we cannot renegotiate purchasing on favorable terms the cost of obtaining content could increase and our gross margins may be adversely affected in addition the risk associated with accurately predicting title demand could increase if we are required to directly purchase more titles 

  

if the sales price of dvds to retail consumers decreases our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

the cost of manufacturing dvds is substantially less than the price for which new dvds are generally sold in the retail market thus we believe that studios and other resellers of dvds have significant flexibility in pricing dvds for retail sale if the retail price of dvds decreases significantly consumers may choose to purchase dvds instead of subscribing to our service 

any significant disruption in service on our web site or in our computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers 

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site where the title selection process is integrated with our delivery processing systems and software our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our web site network infrastructure and fulfillment processes interruptions in these systems or with the internet in general could make our web site unavailable and hinder our ability to fulfill selections for example in august 2008 we suffered a service interruption that impacted our ability to ship and receive dvds as well as stream movies to our subscribers much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of our web site could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our web site service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services in certain instances we have voluntarily provided affected subscribers with a credit during periods of extended outage any significant disruption to our web site or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our communications hardware and the computer hardware used to operate our web site and our streaming of content are hosted at the facilities of a third party provider hardware for our delivery systems is maintained in our shipping centers fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business problems faced by our third party web hosting provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its customers including us could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers 

in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations could be adversely affected 

our executive offices and data center are located in the san francisco bay area we have shipping centers located throughout the united states including earthquake and hurricanesensitive areas our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of these natural disasters as well as from electrical blackouts fires floods power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations to handle disruptions in service arising from these events because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our executive offices and data center we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes and may not have adequate insurance to cover losses and expenses from other natural disasters 

  

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and our disclosure of or unauthorized access to subscriber data could adversely impact our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendation service we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business in addition if unauthorized access to our subscriber data were to occur or if we were to disclose data about our subscribers in a manner that was objectionable to them our business reputation could be adversely affected and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results 

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our subscriber data particularly billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

we maintain personal data regarding our subscribers including names and mailing addresses with respect to billing data such as credit card numbers we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data if despite these measures we or our payment processing service experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers we could face legal claims and our business could be adversely affected similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

in addition because we obtain subscribers’ billing information on our web site we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory and streaming typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

increases in payment processing fees or changes to operating rules would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit cards our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to rules regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods which are predominately credit cards and debit cards these rules regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings we have filed and from time to time we expect to file for trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site our recommendation service title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site or our recommendation service or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

  

if we become subject to liability for content that we produce publish or distribute through our service our results of operations would be adversely affected 

as a producer publisher and distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we produce publish or distribute we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations we cannot assure that we are adequately insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us 

if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change or if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

the manner in which internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet including laws limiting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs 

changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and recently enacted rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission have increased and may continue to increase our expenses as we devote resources to their requirements 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

  

risks related to our stock ownership 

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over netflix 

as of december 31 2008 our executive officers and directors their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 29 of our outstanding common stock and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days in particular jay hoag one of our directors beneficially owned approximately 20 and reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board beneficially owned approximately 6 these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from other stockholders and will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded since our may 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

  

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

our stockbased compensation expenses totaled 123 million 120 million and 127 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we expect our stockbased compensation expenses will continue to be significant in future periods which will have an adverse impact on our operating results the latticebinomial model used by us requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s price volatility of the underlying stock if facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future period expenses may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect the fair value estimate of stockbased payments our operating income net income and net income per share 

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues gross margin operating expenses number of paying subscribers number of dvds shipped per day and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

our business 

with more than 10 million subscribers we are the largest online movie rental subscription service in the united states we offer a variety of subscription plans with no due dates no late fees no shipping fees and no payperview fees we provide subscribers access to over 100000 dvd and bluray titles plus more than 12000 streaming content choices subscribers select titles at our web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service and merchandising tools subscribers can 

 

  

 our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of dvd by mail and streaming content we offer over 100000 titles on dvd in comparison the 12000 content choices available for streaming are relatively limited we expect to substantially broaden the content choices as more content becomes available to us until such time by bundling dvd and streaming as part of the netflix subscription we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely comprehensive selection of movies for one low monthly price we believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service this advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the internet from competing services by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand distribution and our proprietary merchandising platform despite the growing popularity of internet delivered content we expect that dvd will continue to be the primary means by which most netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future however at some point in the future we expect that internet delivery of content directly to the home will surpass dvd 

key business metrics 

management periodically reviews certain key business metrics within the context of our articulated performance goals in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business the key business metrics include the following 

 

  

  

 management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric please see “results of operations” below for further discussion on these key business metrics 

  

performance highlights 

the following represents our performance highlights for 2008 2007 and 2006 in thousands except for per share amounts percentages and subscriber acquisition costs 

 

  

 recent developments 

we continue to broaden the content available for streaming including recent additions of content from cbs disney sony and starz play we have also announced several partnerships with technology and consumer electronics companies that enable our subscribers to watch streaming content without commercial interruption these partners include roku lg electronics microsoft samsung tivo and vizio 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates 

content accounting 

we obtain content from studios and distributors through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements or license agreements 

we acquire dvd content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such we consider our dvd library to be a productive asset accordingly we classify our dvd library as a noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheets additionally in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 95 statement of cash flows “sfas 95” cash outflows for the acquisition of the dvd library net of changes in related accounts payable are classified as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows this is inclusive of any upfront nonrefundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements 

we amortize our dvds less estimated salvage value on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives the useful life of the newrelease dvds and backcatalog dvds is estimated to be one year and three years respectively in estimating the useful life of our dvds we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds 

  

for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives a salvage value of 300 per dvd has been provided for those dvds that we do not expect to sell no salvage value is provided we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvds 

we also obtain content distribution rights in order to stream movies and tv episodes without commercial interruption to subscribers we account for streaming content in accordance with sfas no 63 reporting by broadcasters “sfas 63” which requires classification of streaming content as either a current or noncurrent asset in the consolidated balance sheets based on the estimated time of usage after certain criteria have been met including availability of the streaming content for its first showing we amortize our streaming content on a straightline basis generally over the term of the related license agreements or the title’s window of availability cash outflows associated with the streaming content are classified as cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we also obtain dvd and streaming content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or a fee based on utilization over a fixed period or the title term which typically ranges from six to twelve months for each title the initial cost may be in the form of an upfront nonrefundable payment this payment is capitalized in the content library in accordance with our dvd and streaming content policies as applicable the initial cost may also be in the form of a prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense the terms of some revenue sharing agreements with studios obligate us to make minimum revenue sharing payments for certain titles we amortize minimum revenue sharing prepayments or accrete an amount payable to studios if the payment is due in arrears as revenue sharing obligations are incurred a provision for estimated shortfall if any on minimum revenue sharing payments is made in the period in which the shortfall becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated under the revenue sharing agreements for our dvd library at the end of the title term we generally have the option of returning the dvd to the studio destroying the dvd or purchasing the dvd 

additionally the terms of certain dvd direct purchase agreements with studios provide for volume purchase discounts or rebates based on achieving specified performance levels volume purchase discounts are recorded as a reduction of dvd library when earned we accrue for rebates as earned based on historical title performance and estimates of demand for the titles over the remainder of the title term 

stockbased compensation 

we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment “sfas 123r” on january 1 2006 under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period 

we changed our method of calculating the fair value of new stockbased compensation awards under our stock plans from a blackscholes model to a latticebinomial model on january 1 2007 we continue to use a blackscholes option model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares the latticebinomial model has been applied prospectively to options granted subsequent to january 1 2007 the latticebinomial model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

   

 we grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis we have elected to grant all options as nonqualified stock options which vest immediately as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expense determined under sfas no 123r is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for postvesting option forfeitures see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sfas no 123r 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized by applying the enacted tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced if necessary by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 

as of december 31 2008 our deferred tax asset balance was 280 million as of december 31 2007 our deferred tax asset balance was 191 million there was no valuation allowance as of december 31 2008 or 2007 

during 2007 we adopted the financial accounting standard board’s “fasb” financial interpretation no “fin” 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” fin 48 changes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a new framework for how companies should recognize measure present and disclose uncertain tax positions in their financial statements under fin 48 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination

 the increase in our revenues in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily a result of the substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online movie and tv episode rentals and other aspects of our service this increase was offset in part by a decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber resulting from the continued growth in our lower cost subscription plans as well as a price reduction for our most popular subscription plans during the third quarter of 2007 we expect the average revenue per paying subscriber to continue to decline until the mix of new subscribers and existing subscribers is approximately equivalent by subscription plan price point 

  

the following table presents our ending subscriber information

fulfillment expenses 

 

 the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our shipping centers and customer service location coupled with higher credit card fees as a result of the growth in the average number of paying subscribers in addition the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facilityrelated costs resulting from the addition of new shipping centers and for 2007 the expansion of our customer service center 

gross margin 

 

 the decrease in gross margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in postage rates effective may 2008 and 2007 and a reduction in the prices of our most popular subscription plans during the second half of 2007 in addition costs related to our streaming content have been included in cost of subscriptions beginning january 2007 

we anticipate that gross margin will decline in 2009 due to increased investment in content library coupled with an expected increase in postage rates effective may 2009 

operating expenses

marketing 

 

 the decrease in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing program spending principally in direct mail and inserts in the second half of 2007 we lowered prices on our most popular subscription plans and decided to partially offset the cost of our investment in lower prices by reducing our spending on marketing programs subscriber acquisition cost decreased in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to more efficient marketing spending 

the decrease in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing program spending principally in television advertising and direct mail subscriber acquisition cost decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to more efficient marketing spending 

general and administrative

the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs due to growth in headcount the increase was also attributable to higher costs related to legal proceedings 

gain on disposal of dvds 

 

 the decrease in gain on disposal of dvds in absolute dollars in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to a decrease in the sales price of dvds 

  

the increase in gain on disposal of dvds in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of dvds sold offset in part by an increase in the cost of dvd sales 

in the first quarter of 2009 we discontinued retail sales of previously viewed dvd’s to subscribers however we will continue to sell previously viewed dvds through wholesale channels 

gain on legal settlement 

on june 25 2007 we resolved a pending patent litigation with blockbuster inc as part of the settlement we received a onetime payment of 70 million during the second quarter of 2007 

interest expense on lease financing obligations 

 

 in june 2004 and june 2006 we entered into two separate lease arrangements whereby we leased a building that was constructed by a third party as discussed in note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements we have accounted for these leases in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” no 9710 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction “eitf 9710” and sfas no 98 accounting for leases saleleaseback transactions involving real estate salestype leases of real estate definition of the lease term and initial direct costs of direct financing leases an amendment of fasb statements no 13 66 and 91 and a rescission of fasb statement no 26 and technical bulletin no 7911 “sfas 98” which causes netflix to be considered the owner for accounting purposes of the two buildings 

accordingly we have recorded assets on our balance sheet for the costs paid by our lessor to construct our headquarters facilities along with corresponding financing liabilities for amounts equal to these lessorpaid construction costs the monthly rent payments we make to our lessor under our lease agreements are recorded in our financial statements as land lease expense and principal and interest on the financing liabilities interest expense on lease financing obligations reflects the portion of our monthly lease payments that is allocated to interest expense 

interest and other income expense 

 

 the decrease in interest and other income in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily a result of the lower cash balance resulting from the repurchase of our common stock interest and other income expense consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from invested cash and shortterm investments interest and dividend income was approximately 9 million 20 million and 16 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively additionally in 2008 interest and other income included approximately 3 million gain on the sale of shortterm investments 

  

the increase in interest and other income in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily a result of our newly invested shortterm investment portfolio which was higher yielding than our money market funds and higher average cash balances 

provision for income taxes 

 

 in 2008 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes of 5 million or 4 of income before income tax this was partially offset by rd tax credits of 3 million in 2007 and 2006 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001 many factors will impact our ability to continue to generate and grow cash from our operations including but not limited to the number of subscribers who sign up for our service and the growth or reduction in our subscriber base in addition we may have to or otherwise choose to lower our prices and increase our marketing expenses in order to grow faster or respond to competition although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with our available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 

our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations which consists primarily of net income adjusted for noncash items such as amortization of our content library depreciation of property and equipment and stockbased compensation related to the issuance of common stock our primary uses of cash include our stock repurchase programs shipping and packaging expenses the acquisition of content capital expenditures related to it and automation equipment for operations marketing and fulfillment expenses 

in 2009 operating cash flows will be a significant source of liquidity while the shipping and packaging expenses acquisition of content marketing and fulfillment expenses will continue to be significant uses of cash in addition on january 26 2009 we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase our common stock through the end of 2009 based on the board’s authorization the company anticipates a repurchase program of up to 175 million in 2009 the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions the following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

   

operating activities 

during 2008 our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of 830 million increased by noncash adjustments of 2251 million offset by a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 241 million the majority of the noncash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of 2098 million which increased by 63 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles in order to support our larger subscriber base the decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by acquisitions of content library related to our streaming content as we continued to increase our investments in streaming content in 2008 cash provided by operating activities increased 66 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 this was primarily due to an increase in net income of 164 million increased noncash adjustments of 298 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 396 million

investing activities 

our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of availableforsale securities acquisitions of content library related to dvds and purchases of property and equipment cash used in investing activities decreased 2911 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the purchases of shortterm investments of 1484 million coupled with an increase in the proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments of 1065 million in addition content acquisitions related to acquisitions of dvds decreased by 458 million as more dvds were obtained through revenue sharing agreements in 2008

cash provided by financing activities decreased by 1902 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to stock repurchases of 999 million in 2007 and a decrease of 1034 million in issuances of common stock as we had raised 1011 million in a secondary offering in 2006 we did not have any stock repurchases during 2006 this use of cash was offset by the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 262 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 

as a result of current adverse financial market conditions investments in some financial instruments such as structured investment vehicles subprime mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations may pose risks arising from recent market liquidity and credit concerns as of december 31 2008 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio relating to such adverse financial market conditions although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline at december 31 2008 our cash 

  

equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities approximately 60 of the portfolio is invested in government and agency issued securities 

at december 31 2008 we had securities classified as shortterm investments of 1574 million changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments the table below separates these investments based on stated maturities to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 

 

 a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december 31 2008 the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values in  thousands of our debt securities classified as short term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points “bps” 100 bps and 150 bps the analysis is shown as of december 31 2008

our subscription service has grown rapidly since inception this growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of dvds as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online dvd rentals we also believe our growth has been driven by our comprehensive selection of titles consistently high levels of customer satisfaction and our effective marketing programs we expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online dvd rentals continues to grow a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model 

our core strategy is to grow a large dvd subscription business and to expand into internetbased delivery of content as that market develops we believe that the dvd format along with its high definition successor formats including bluray will continue to be the main vehicle for watching content in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large dvd subscription business we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to internetbased delivery of content in january 2007 we introduced our instantwatching feature for pcs we intend to broaden the distribution capability of our instantwatching feature to other platforms and partners over time in january 2008 we announced a development arrangement with lg electronics while the terms of this arrangement have not been finalized we anticipate developing in conjunction with lg electronics and other consumer electronics’ manufacturers a settop box device or other devices that will enable our instantwatching feature to be viewed directly on subscribers’ televisions 

our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandise our comprehensive library of content we believe that our recommendation technology based on proprietary algorithms and the approximately 20 billion movie ratings collected from our subscribers enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization 

  

we promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs including online promotions television and radio advertising package inserts direct mail and other promotions with third parties these programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period at the end of the free trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers unless they cancel their subscription all paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance 

we stock approximately 90000 dvd titles we have established revenue sharing relationships with several studios and distributors we also purchase titles directly from studios distributors and other suppliers in addition we have more than 6000 choices available on our web site for instantwatching 

we ship and receive dvds throughout the united states we maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allows us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers 

we are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements 

we are organized in a single operating segment all our revenues are generated in the united states and we have no longlived assets outside the united states substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees 

industry overview 

filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels including movie theaters airlines hotels and inhome inhome distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets cable and satellite television payperview videoondemand or vod and broadcast television currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market four to seven months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to premium television and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and network television however in what continues to be an emerging trend the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window we anticipate that the studios will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window including releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod but we believe that dvd and its high definition successors such as bluray will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits dvd generates for the studios 

challenges faced by consumers in selecting inhome filmed entertainment 

the proliferation of new releases available for inhome filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalog titles on dvd create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles 

first despite the large number of available titles on dvd existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets stock a limited selection of titles frustrating consumer demand for more choice subscription channels payperview and vod services continue to offer a relatively narrow selection of titles likewise traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles we believe our selection of approximately 90000 titles on dvd offers an attractive alternative to these traditional channels 

second even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service and our web site features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences 

  

competitive strengths 

we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths

our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database this technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber

merchandising 

our merchandising efforts are based on the personal recommendations generated by our recommendation service all subscribers and site visitors are given many opportunities to rate titles and as of december 31 2007 we have collected approximately 20 billion ratings the ratings from our recommendation service help determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order in doing so we help our subscribers quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy ratings also help determine which available titles are featured most prominently on our web site in an effort to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity finally data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our recommendations tool to find other titles they might enjoy this is a powerful method for catalog browsing and expanding library utilization

under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment for a defined period of time either to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or to pay a fee based on content utilization after the revenue sharing period expires for a title we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio destroying the title or purchasing the title the principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio we also purchase titles from various studios distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis under these arrangements we typically pay a per disc fee for each of the dvds we purchase for titles delivered through our instantwatching feature we generally license the content directly for a period of time following expiration of the license term we are no longer able to distribute the content through our instantwatching feature unless we extend or renew the associated license agreement 

  

fulfillment operations 

we currently stock approximately 90000 titles on more than 69 million dvds we have allocated substantial resources to developing maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our web site transaction processing systems fulfillment operations inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers 

we ship and receive dvds from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the united states we believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our dvds through the us postal service we currently do not ship on weekends or holidays 

customer service 

we believe that our ability to establish and maintain longterm relationships with subscribers depends in part on the strength of our customer support and service operations our customer service center is open seven days a week in 2007 we substantially increased our investment in customer service in order to improve the overall quality and level of service to our subscribers in addition we continue to focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and providing certain selfservice features on our web site such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems we continue to explore new avenues to deliver efficient problem resolution and feedback channels our customer service center is located in hillsboro oregon 

competition 

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart or amazon download a movie from apple and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month 

video rental outlets retailers and kiosk services with whom we compete include blockbuster movie gallery amazoncom walmart stores best buy and redbox we believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection convenience and price we believe that our scalable business model our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of approximately 90000 dvd titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets and retailers 

we also compete against other online and storebased dvd subscription services such as blockbuster’s total access subscription entertainment services such as hbo showtime and starz payperview and vod providers and cable and satellite providers 

vod and delivery of movies over the internet may also emerge as a competitive distribution channel apple’s video ipod and apple tv amazon’s unbox and other companies ranging from google and yahoo to microsoft and intel are active in internet delivery of content progress in digital delivery although slow and scattered continues to be made vod for example is now widely available to digital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas such as new york boston los angeles and san francisco internet delivery of movies to a computer is currently available from providers such as itunes hulu vongo movielink and cinemanow 

while we anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years we believe that dvd and its high definition successors including bluray will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term at some point in the future digital delivery directly to the home will surpass dvd our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences and our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for dvd rentals positions 

  

us favorably to further develop our digital distribution offering as that market develops the downloading market is segmented into rental of internet delivered content the downloadtoown segment and the advertisingsupported online delivery segment and we believe we will lead the rental segment with our instantwatching feature as it develops 

in late 2006 blockbuster launched its integrated storebased and online program total access whereby blockbuster online subscribers may return dvds delivered to them from blockbuster online to blockbuster stores in exchange for an instore rental total access was aggressively priced and experienced rapid subscriber growth and large operating losses in the first half of 2007 in the second half of 2007 blockbuster adopted a new competitive strategy which emphasized profitable growth as part of this new strategy blockbuster reduced their marketing spending and raised prices on total access which we believe contributed to an acceleration in our subscriber growth 

we believe we are able to provide greater satisfaction for consumers who subscribe to our service due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental and the broad and deep selection of dvd titles we offer subscribers in addition we have the ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on their selection history personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select receive and return dvds 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we had 1542 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments as of december 31 2007 we had 1128 parttime and temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

intellectual property 

we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we have filed patents in the us and abroad in the us we were issued broad business method patents covering among other things our subscription rental service in 2003 and 2006 and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005 while our patents are an important element of our business our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents we have registered trademarks and service marks for the netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks our software the content of our web site and other material which we create are protected by copyright we also protect certain details about our business methods processes and strategies as trade secrets and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 

our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming to date we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and knowhow to protect our intellectual property it is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage 

from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot assure that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute

 item 1a risk factors tableend if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful our revenues will be adversely affected 

we must continue to attract subscribers to our service our ability to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting viewing receiving and returning titles including providing accurate recommendations through our recommendation service furthermore the relative service levels pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract subscribers competitors include video retailers video rental outlets kiosk services internet content providers including online dvd rental services cable channels such as hbo showtime and starz pay perview and vod if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract subscribers in addition many of our subscribers are rejoining our service originate from wordofmouth advertising and are directly referred to our service from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract subscribers and as a result our revenues will be adversely affected 

if the market segment for online dvd rentals saturates our business will be adversely affected 

we have experienced rapid growth of our online dvd rental subscription business since our inception we have attracted a large number of subscribers who have traditionally used video retailers video rental outlets cable channels payperview and vod for their inhome filmed entertainment while the market segment for online dvd rental has grown significantly we saw our growth slow in 2007 our slowing growth appears primarily to be the result of the rapid growth of our direct competitor blockbuster online even with the apparent reduced competitive threat from blockbuster online our rate of growth may continue to slow such slowing growth could indicate that the market segment for online rentals is beginning to saturate while we believe that online dvd rentals will continue to grow for the foreseeable future if this market segment were to saturate our business would be adversely affected 

if we experience excessive rates of churn our revenues and business will be harmed 

we must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently delivery takes too long the service is a poor value competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our churn will likely increase and our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies for delivery of inhome filmed entertainment such as vod and internet delivery of content continue to receive considerable media and investor attention many of our competitors have longer operating 

  

histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

in addition many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart or amazon download a movie from apple and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at a relatively low cost dvds and internet delivery of content represent only two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing filmed entertainment in addition the growth in adoption of dvd and downloading technology is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies we may not be able to achieve adequate market share increase our revenues or maintain profitability 

our principal competitors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing web site and systems development than we do there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current or new competitors at our existing pricing levels or at even lower price points in the future furthermore we may need to adjust the level of service provided to our subscribers andor incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate as a result of increased competition we may see a reduction in operating margins and market share 

if vod or other technologies are more widely adopted and supported as a method of content delivery by the studios and consumers our business could be adversely affected 

some digital cable providers and internet content providers have implemented technology referred to as vod this technology transmits movies and other entertainment content on demand with interactive capabilities such as start stop and rewind highspeed internet access has greatly increased the speed and quality of viewing vod content including featurelength movies on personal computers and televisions in addition other technologies have been developed that allow alternative means for consumers to receive and watch movies or other entertainment such as on cell phones or other devices such as apple’s video ipod and apple tv although we anticipate providing solutions for the internetbased delivery of content as evidenced by our instantwatching feature vod or other technologies may become more affordable and viable alternative methods of content delivery that are widely supported by studios and adopted by consumers if this happens more quickly than we anticipate or more quickly than our own internet delivery offerings or if other providers are better able to meet studio and consumer needs and expectations our business could be adversely affected 

  

if the popularity of the dvd format decreases our business could be adversely affected 

consumers have rapidly adopted the dvd format for viewing inhome filmed entertainment while the growth of dvd sales has slowed we believe that the dvd format including any successor formats such as bluray will be valuable longterm consumer propositions and studio profit centers however if dvd sales were to decrease because of a shift away from movie watching or because new or existing technologies were to become more popular at the expense of dvd enjoyment studios and retailers may reduce their support of the dvd format our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by future popularity of the dvd format and if such popularity wanes our subscriber growth may also slow 

if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine or if studios were to release or distribute titles on dvd in a manner that attempts to circumvent or limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected 

under us copyright law once a copyright owner sells a copy of his work the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy while the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work the copyright owner gives up his ability to control the fate of the work once it had been sold as such once a dvd is sold into the market those obtaining the dvd are permitted to resell it rent it or otherwise dispose of it if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine our ability to obtain content and then rent it could be adversely affected likewise if studios agree to limit the sale or distribution of their content in ways that try to limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected for example in late 2006 and again in late 2007 blockbuster announced arrangements with certain content owners pursuant to which blockbuster would receive content on dvds for rental exclusively by blockbuster to the extent this content is to be distributed exclusively to blockbuster and not to retail vendors or distributors we could be prevented from obtaining such content to the extent the content is also sold to retail vendors or distributors we would not be prohibited from obtaining and renting such content pursuant to the first sale doctrine nonetheless it does impact our ability to obtain such content in the most efficient manner and in some cases in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand if such arrangements were to become more commonplace or if additional impediments to obtaining content were created such as an exclusive rental window our ability to obtain content could be impacted and our business could be adversely affected 

we depend on studios to release titles on dvd for an exclusive time period following theatrical release 

our ability to attract and retain subscribers is related to our ability to offer new releases of filmed entertainment on dvds prior to their release to other distribution channels except for theatrical release dvds currently enjoy a significant competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early distribution window for dvds the window for dvd rental and retail sales is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview premium television basic cable and network and syndicated television the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies our business could suffer increased competition if 

 

  

  

 the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the title and we cannot assure you that the studios will not change their policies in the future in a manner that would be adverse to our business and results of operations currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market four to seven months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to premium television and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and network television over the past 

  

several years the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window in addition some studios have discussed eliminating the exclusive dvd release window on certain titles in particular releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod 

we depend on studios to license us content for internet delivery in order to operate our instantwatching feature 

internet delivery of content involves the licensing of rights which are separate from and independent of the rights we obtain when acquiring dvd content our ability to provide our instantwatching feature therefore depends on studios licensing us content specifically for internet delivery the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary by studio if the studios change their terms and conditions or are no longer willing or able to provide us licenses our ability to provide internet delivered content to our subscribers will be adversely affected unlike dvd internet delivered content is not subject to the first sale doctrine as such we are completely dependent on the studios providing us licenses in order to access and distribute internet delivered content in addition the studios have great flexibility in licensing content they may elect to license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver internet delivered content for example hbo licenses content from studios like warner bros and the license provides hbo with the exclusive right to such content against other subscription services including netflix as such netflix cannot license certain warner bros content for delivery to its subscribers while warner bros may nonetheless license the same content to transactional vod providers this ability to carveup distribution rights is unique to digital content if we are unable to secure rights to content and to obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us our ability to operate our instantwatching feature will be adversely impacted and our subscriber satisfaction with this feature will also be adversely impacted 

we intend to rely on a number of partners to deliver our internet delivered content to various devices 

we currently offer internet delivered content only to pcs we intend to broaden the distribution capability of our instantwatching feature to other platforms and partners over time in january 2008 we announced our development arrangement with lg electronics while the terms of this arrangement have not been finalized we anticipate developing in conjunction with lg a settop box device that will enable our instantwatching feature to be viewed directly through subscribers’ televisions we intend to enter other deals with additional partners for distribution of our content to various devices if we are not successful in creating these relationships or if we encounter technological content licensing or other impediments our ability to grow our instantwatching feature could be adversely impacted 

if we experience increased demand for titles which we are unable to offset with increased subscriber retention or operating margins our operating results may be adversely affected 

with our unlimited plans there is no established limit to the number of movies that subscribers may rent on dvd or as we recently announced watch through our instantwatching feature we are continually adjusting our service in ways that may impact subscriber movie usage such adjustments include new web site features and merchandising practices computerbased instant watching of select titles through our instantwatching feature an expanded dvd distribution network and software and process changes in addition demand for titles may increase for a variety of reasons beyond our control including promotion by studios and seasonal variations or shifts in consumer movie watching 

if our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of any increased operating costs associated with increased usage our operating results will be adversely affected in addition our subscriber growth and retention may be adversely affected if we attempt to alter our service or increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles 

  

if our subscribers select titles or formats that are more expensive for us to acquire and deliver more frequently our expenses may increase 

certain titles cost us more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they are acquired and the terms on which they are acquired if subscribers select these titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected our revenue sharing and other content acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected in addition films released on the new high definition dvd formats bluray and hd dvd and those released for internet delivery may be more expensive to acquire than in dvd format the rate of customer acceptance and adoption of these new formats is uncertain if subscribers select these formats on a proportional basis more often than the existing dvd format our content acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected 

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the netflix brand is still developing and we must continue to build strong brand identity to succeed we must continue to attract and retain a large number of owners of dvd players who have traditionally relied on storebased rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service through our web site in addition we will have to compete for subscribers against other brands which have greater recognition than ours such as blockbuster we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will only increase in light of competition both for online subscription services and other means of distributing titles such as vod from time to time our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among other things our inventory allocation and delivery processing to the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including third party banner ads popunder placements direct links and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including television and radio advertising direct mail and print campaigns consumer package and mailing insertions we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership we maintain an active public relations program to increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide to enter our business or a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such channels in addition if ad rates increase we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our cost per subscriber laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of email and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

  

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be adversely affected 

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 many of our systems and operational practices were implemented when we were at a smaller scale of operations if we are not able to refine or revise these legacy systems as we grow if they fail or if in responding to any other issues related to growth our management is materially distracted from our current operations our business may be adversely affected 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations including our instantwatching feature and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we use complex proprietary software to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations including our instantwatching feature our proprietary technology is intended to allow our nationwide network of shipping centers to be operated on an integrated basis we continually enhance or modify the software used for our distribution operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers future enhancements and modifications to our proprietary technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of dvds among our shipping centers in a timely and efficient manner our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired in addition through our instantwatching feature our subscribers will access titles on our web site through our proprietary movie player software and must maintain their connection to our web site for an uninterrupted viewing experience if this proprietary software fails to satisfactorily display the available titles our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired also any harm to our subscribers’ personal computers caused by the proprietary software could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather natural disasters labor activism health epidemics or bioterrorism our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit 

increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on january 8 2006 by 2 cents from 37 cents to 39 cents and then again in may 2007 by another 2 cents the us postal service has announced an increase in the rate for first class postage effective in may 2008 by one cent to 42 cents and it is also expected that the us postal service will raise rates again in subsequent years in accordance with the powers recently given the us postal service in connection with the postal reform legislation the us postal service continues to focus on plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds and our gross margin could be adversely affected for example the office of inspector general at the us postal service recently issued a report 

  

recommending that the us postal service revise the machinability qualifications for first class mail related to dvds or to charge dvd mailers who don’t comply with the new regulations a 17 cent surcharge on all mail deemed unmachinable we do not currently anticipate any material impact to our operational practices or postage delivery rates arising from this report also if the us postal service curtails its services such as by closing facilities or discontinuing or reducing saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be adversely affected 

currently most filmed entertainment is packaged on a single lightweight dvd our delivery process is designed to accommodate the delivery of one dvd to fulfill a selection because of the lightweight nature of a dvd we generally mail one dvd per envelope using standard first class us postage rates studios occasionally provide additional content on a second dvd or may package a title on two dvds in addition the studios have begun to release certain films in high definition format on bluray and hd dvds these new high definition format dvds appear to have higher damage rates than regular dvds if packaging of filmed entertainment on multiple dvds were to become more prevalent if the weight of dvds were to increase or the durability of dvds deteriorate our costs of delivery and fulfillment processing would increase and our costs of replacing damaged dvds may rise materially which would depress gross margins and profitability and adversely affect free cash flow 

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation service our business may suffer 

based on proprietary algorithms our recommendation service enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation service to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure that the proprietary algorithms in our recommendation service will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

we are continually refining our recommendation service in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements in addition we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation service 

if our recommendation service does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

 

  

  

 if we do not acquire sufficient dvd titles our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we do not acquire sufficient copies of dvds either by not correctly anticipating demand or by intentionally acquiring fewer copies than needed to fully satisfy demand we may not appropriately satisfy subscriber demand and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be adversely affected conversely if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be adversely affected our ability to accurately predict subscriber demand as well as market factors such as exclusive distribution arrangements may impact our ability to acquire appropriate quantities of certain dvds 

  

if we are unable to renew or renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us or if the cost of purchasing titles on a wholesale basis increases our gross margins may be adversely affected 

we acquire dvds through a mix of revenue sharing agreements as well as direct purchase arrangements whether we enter into a direct purchase or revenue sharing arrangement depends on the economic terms we can negotiate as well as studio preferences starting in 2000 we entered into numerous revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors which typically enabled us to increase our copy depth of dvds on an economical basis because of a low initial payment with additional payments made only if our subscribers rent the dvd during the course of our revenue sharing relationships various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors may be adversely impacted 

as the revenue sharing agreements expire we must renegotiate new terms or shift to direct purchasing arrangements under which we must pay the full wholesale price regardless of whether the dvd is rented we have seen the purchase mix shift toward direct purchasing arrangements as revenue sharing agreements expire if we cannot renegotiate purchasing arrangements on favorable terms the cost of acquiring content could increase and our gross margins may be adversely affected in addition the risk associated with accurately predicting title demand could increase if we are required to directly purchase more titles 

if the sales price of dvds to retail consumers decreases our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

the cost of manufacturing dvds is substantially less than the price for which new dvds are generally sold in the retail market thus we believe that studios and other resellers of dvds have significant flexibility in pricing dvds for retail sale if the retail price of dvds decreases significantly consumers may choose to purchase dvds instead of subscribing to our service 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

any significant disruption in service on our web site or in our computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers 

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site where the title selection process is integrated with our delivery processing systems and software our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our web site network infrastructure and fulfillment processes interruptions in these systems could make our web site unavailable and hinder our ability to fulfill selections much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems in addition through our instantwatching feature our subscribers access titles on our web site through our proprietary movie player software and must maintain their connection to our web site for an uninterrupted viewing experience service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of our web site could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by 

  

hackers to disrupt our web site service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our web site or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our communications hardware and the computer hardware used to operate our web site and our internetbased delivery of content are hosted at the facilities of a third party provider hardware for our delivery systems is maintained in our shipping centers fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business problems faced by our third party web hosting provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its customers including us could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers 

our executive offices and our sunnyvalebased shipping center are located in the san francisco bay area in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations would be adversely affected 

our executive offices and our sunnyvalebased shipping center are located in the san francisco bay area our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of electrical blackouts fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations due to disruptions in service in the san francisco bay area or any other facility because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our sunnyvalebased operations center and the surrounding transportation infrastructure we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes 

the loss of our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief marketing officer or our failure to attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business and new service developments 

we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board barry mccarthy our chief financial officer and leslie j kilgore our chief marketing officer in addition much of our key technology and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendation service we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

to secure transmission of confidential information obtained by us for billing purposes including subscribers’ credit card data we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology in conjunction with the payment processing companies we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data if despite these measures we experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers and our business could be adversely affected similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

in addition because we obtain subscribers’ billing information on our web site we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

increases in payment processing fees or changes to operating rules would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit cards our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis these fees may increase in 2008 such increases may adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to rules regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods which are predominately credit cards and debit cards these rules regulations and practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings netflix is a registered trademark of netflix inc in the united states canada the united kingdom japan and australia we have also registered the netflix design logo and the service mark “friends” in the united states and have filed us patent applications for certain aspects of our technology we have also filed a trademark application in the european union for the netflix name from time to time we expect to file additional trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent 

  

use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site our recommendation service title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights successfully defend our use or develop noninfringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site or our recommendation service or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

forecasting film revenue and associated gross profits from our films prior to release is extremely difficult and may result in significant writeoffs 

we are required to amortize capitalized film production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from the associated films the amount of film production costs that will be amortized each period depends on how much future revenue we expect to receive from each film unamortized film production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a filmbyfilm basis if estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized film production costs the unamortized film production costs will be written down to fair value in any given period if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film we would be required to accelerate amortization of related film costs such accelerated amortization would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition in addition we base our estimates of revenue on performance of comparable titles and our knowledge of the industry if the information is incorrect the amount of revenue and related expenses that we recognize from our films could be wrong which could result in fluctuations in our earnings 

  

if we become subject to liability for content that we publish or distribute through our service our results of operations would be adversely affected 

as a publisher of content a host of third party content and a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute for example our whollyowned subsidiary red envelope entertainment llc or ree llc which is dedicated to acquiring and funding original content productions may be exposed to liability for copyright infringement and other claims relating to the original content we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews 

if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations we cannot assure that we are adequately insured to cover claims of these types or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed on us 

if government regulation of the internet or other areas of our business changes or if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change we may need to change the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

the manner in which internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet including laws limiting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business in addition if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change consumers may become unwilling to select their entertainment online or otherwise provide us with information necessary for them to become subscribers further we may not be able to effectively market our services online to users of the internet if we are unable to interact with consumers because of changes in their attitude toward use of the internet our subscriber acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position as we have grown we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us most of these matters relate to patent infringement lawsuits which are typically expensive to defend litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs 

changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and recently enacted rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission have increased and may continue to increase our expenses as we devote resources to their requirements 

  

deterioration in the economy could impact our business 

netflix is an entertainment service and payment for our service may be considered discretionary on the part of many of our current and potential subscribers to the extent the overall economy deteriorates such as in the case of a recession our business could be impacted as subscribers choose either to leave our service or reduce their service levels also our efforts to attract new subscribers may be adversely impacted 

risks related to our stock ownership 

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over netflix 

as of december 31 2007 our executive officers and directors their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 31 of our outstanding common stock and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days in particular jay hoag one of our directors beneficially owned approximately 23 and reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board beneficially owned approximately 7 these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from other stockholders and will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded since our may 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

during the second quarter of 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation ” “sfas no 123” for stockbased employee compensation in addition during the third quarter of 2003 we began granting stock options to our employees on a monthly basis the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately in comparison with the three to fouryear vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expenses determined under sfas no 123 are fully recognized in the same periods as the monthly stock option grants our stockbased compensation expenses totaled 120 million 127 million and 143 million during 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we expect our stockbased compensation expenses will continue to be significant in future periods which will have an adverse impact on our operating results the latticebinomial model used by us requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s price volatility of the underlying stock if facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future period expenses may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect the fair value estimate of stockbased payments our operating income net income and net income per share 

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues gross margin operating expenses number of paying subscribers number of dvds shipped per day and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

our business 

we are the largest online movie rental subscription service in the united states providing approximately 75 million subscribers access to approximately 90000 dvd titles plus a library of more than 6000 choices that can be watched instantly on their pcs we offer nine subscription plans starting at 499 a month there are no due dates no late fees and no shipping fees subscribers select titles at our web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service receive them on dvd by us mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers after a dvd has been returned we mail the next available dvd in a subscriber’s queue we also offer certain titles through our instantwatching feature the terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at wwwnetflixcomtermsofuse  

our core strategy is to grow a large dvd subscription business and to expand into internetbased delivery of content as that market develops we believe that the dvd format along with its high definition successor formats including bluray will continue to be the main vehicle for watching content in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large dvd subscription business we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to internetbased delivery of content if it becomes the preferred consumer medium for accessing content 

key business metrics 

management periodically reviews certain key business metrics within the context of our articulated performance goals in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business the key business metrics include the following 

 

  

  

 management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric please see “results of operations” below for further discussion on these key business metrics 

performance highlights 

the following represents our 2007 performance highlights 

 

   

recent developments 

we believe that the dvd format along with its high definition successor formats including bluray will continue to be the main vehicle for watching content in the home for the foreseeable future we introduced a new feature in january 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their pcs we intend to broaden the distribution capability of this feature to multiple platforms over time and as a result in january 2008 we announced a development arrangement with lg electronics while the terms of this arrangement have not been finalized we anticipate developing in conjunction with lg a settop box device that will enable our instantwatching feature to be viewed directly through subscribers’ televisions 

in late 2006 blockbuster launched its integrated storebased and online program total access whereby blockbuster online subscribers may return dvds delivered to them from blockbuster online to blockbuster stores in exchange for an instore rental total access was aggressively priced and experienced rapid subscriber growth and large operating losses in the first half of 2007 in the second half of 2007 blockbuster adopted a new competitive strategy which emphasized profitable growth as part of this new strategy blockbuster reduced their marketing spending and raised prices on total access which we believe contributed to an acceleration in our subscriber growth 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the securities and exchange commission “sec” has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

amortization of content library and upfront costs 

we acquire content from studios and distributors through direct purchases revenue sharing agreements or license agreements we acquire content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such we consider our content library to be a productive asset and classify our content library as a noncurrent asset additionally in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 95 statement of cash flows we classify cash outflows for the acquisition of the content library net of changes in related accounts payable as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows this is inclusive of any upfront nonrefundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements 

we amortize our dvds less estimated salvage value on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives the useful life of the newrelease dvds and backcatalog dvds is estimated to be 1 year and 3 years respectively in estimating the useful life of our dvds we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds volume purchase discounts received from studios on the purchase of titles are recorded as a reduction of dvd inventory when earned 

for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives a salvage value of 300 per dvd has been provided for those dvds that we do not expect to sell no salvage value is provided 

we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvds 

  

under revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or a fee based on utilization over a fixed period of time or the title term which is typically between 6 and 12 months for each title at the end of the title term we generally have the option of returning the dvd title to the studio destroying the title or purchasing the title in addition we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our content library amortization policy in some cases this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred 

we amortize license fees on internetbased content on a straightline basis consistent with the terms of the license agreements 

stockbased compensation 

we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment  “sfas no 123r” on january 1 2006 under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas no 123” as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 in the second quarter of 2003 and restated prior periods at that time because the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 and sfas no 123r were materially consistent under our equity plans the adoption of sfas no 123r did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

we changed our method of calculating the fair value of new stockbased compensation awards under our stock plans from a blackscholes model to a latticebinomial model on january 1 2007 we continue to use a blackscholes option model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares the latticebinomial model has been applied prospectively to options granted subsequent to january 1 2007 the latticebinomial model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

  

 we grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis we have elected to grant all options as nonqualified stock options which vest immediately as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expense determined under sfas no 123r is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for postvesting option forfeitures see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas no 123r disclosures 

  

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

at december 31 2007 our deferred tax assets were 185 million as of december 31 2006 deferred tax assets did not include the tax benefits attributable to approximately 56 million of excess tax deductions related to stock options in 2007 these benefits were realized as a reduction of taxes payable and credited to equity 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented the line items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 revenues 

 

 we currently generate all of our revenues in the united states we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscriber’s monthly subscription period 

the increase in our revenues in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily a result of the substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online 

  

dvd rentals this increase was offset in part by a decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber resulting from the continued growth in our lower cost subscription plans as well as a price reduction for our most popular subscription plans during the second quarter of 2007 we expect the average revenue per paying subscriber to continue to decline until the mix of new subscribers and existing subscribers is approximately equivalent by subscription plan price point 

the increase in our revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily a result of the substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers offset in part by a decline in average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber we believe the increase in the number of paying subscribers was driven primarily by increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online dvd rentals and continuing improvements in our service the decline in the average monthly revenue per paying subscriber was a result of the continued popularity of our lower cost subscription plans 

churn was 43 as of december 31 2007 and remained relatively flat as compared to 2006 and 2005

 the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers coupled with higher credit card fees as a result of 32 growth in the average number of paying subscribers in addition the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facilityrelated costs resulting from the expansion of our customer service center the expansion of certain of our shipping centers and the addition of new ones 

the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers coupled with higher credit card fees as a result of 60 growth in the average number of paying subscribers in addition the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facilityrelated costs resulting from the expansion of certain of our shipping centers and the addition of new ones 

we anticipate that fulfillment expenses will increase in 2008 due to higher volume of shipped discs and continued expansion of our network of distribution centers 

gross margin 

 

 the decrease in gross margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in postage rates effective may 2007 and a reduction in the prices of our most popular subscription plans during the second quarter of 2007 in addition costs related to our instantwatching feature have been included in cost of subscriptions beginning january 2007 

  

the increase in gross margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in revenue sharing cost per paid shipment which includes a decline in the percentage of dvds subject to revenue sharing agreements mailed to paying subscribers as well as an increase in revenue per paid shipment as a result of a decline in overall usage and the continued popularity of our lower priced plans the increase in postage rates by 2 cents effective january 8 2006 negatively impacted gross margin however this impact was offset by a decline in fulfillment costs as a result of increased operational efficiencies 

we anticipate that gross margin will decline in 2008 due to the impact of lower prices coupled with the postage rate increase of one cent which is effective may 2008 

operating expenses 

technology and development 

 

 the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily the result of an increase in personnelrelated costs due to growth in headcount and expenses related to the development of solutions for the internetbased delivery of content 

the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of an increase in personnel and facilityrelated costs as well as expenses related to the development of solutions for the internetbased delivery of content 

we continuously research and test a variety of potential improvements to our internal hardware and software systems in an effort to improve our productivity and enhance our subscribers’ experience additionally we continue to develop and enhance solutions for the internetbased delivery of content to our subscribers as a result we expect our technology and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in 2008 

marketing 

 

 the decrease in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to a decrease in marketing program costs principally in television advertising and direct mail in the second half of 2007 we lowered prices on our most popular subscription plans and decided to partially offset the 

  

cost of our investment in lower prices by reducing our spending on marketing programs subscriber acquisition cost decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to a mix of lower prices and more efficient marketing spending 

the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing program costs which included direct mail online advertising and television advertising to attract new subscribers subscriber acquisition cost increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in marketing program spending offset in part by a decrease in cost of providing free trials associated with our lower priced plans coupled with a slight decline in personnelrelated costs 

we anticipate that our marketing expense will decrease in absolute dollars in 2008 due to more efficient use of our marketing dollars 

general and administrative 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs due to growth in headcount the increase was also attributable to higher costs related to legal proceedings 

the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to ongoing legal proceedings personnel costs and professional fees to support our growing operations 

we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in 2008 in order to support our growing operations 

gain on disposal of dvds 

 

 the increase in gain on disposal of dvds in absolute dollars in 2007 and 2006 as compared to 2006 and 2005 respectively was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of dvds sold offset in part by an increase in the cost of dvd sales 

gain on legal settlement 

on june 25 2007 we resolved a pending patent litigation with blockbuster inc as part of the settlement we received a onetime payment of 70 million during the second quarter of 2007 

  

interest and other income expense 

 

 the increase in interest and other income in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily a result of our newly invested shortterm investment portfolio which was higher yielding than our money market funds interest and other income expense consist primarily of interest and dividend income generated from invested cash and shortterm investments interest and dividend income was approximately 197 million 159 million and 58 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

the increase in interest and other income in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents due to increased interest rates as well as higher average cash balances resulting from a net increase in cash flows and net proceeds of 1011 million from the secondary public offering of our common stock in may 2006 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

 

 in 2007 and 2006 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes in 2005 we recorded an income tax benefit of 337 million on pretax income of 83 million our 2005 income tax benefit includes a tax benefit for the reduction in the valuation allowance of 349 million in 2005 we reduced the valuation allowance after determining that substantially all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realizable due to expected future income 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001 many factors will impact our ability to continue to generate and grow cash from our operations including but not limited to the number of subscribers who sign up for our service the growth or reduction in our subscriber base and our ability to develop new revenue sources in addition we may have to or otherwise choose to lower our prices and increase our marketing expenses in order to grow faster or respond to competition although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with our available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 

our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations which consists primarily of net income adjusted for noncash items such as amortization of our content library and the depreciation of property and equipment our primary uses of cash include the acquisition of content marketing and fulfillment expenses 

in 2008 operating cash flows will be a significant source of liquidity while the acquisition of content marketing and fulfillment expenses will continue to be significant uses of cash in addition on january 31 2008 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to 1000 million of 

  

our common stock through the end of 2008 we completed this stock repurchase program in february 2008 the following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 operating activities 

our operating activities consisted primarily of net income of 670 million increased by noncash adjustments of 1948 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 300 million during 2007 the majority of the noncash adjustments came from the amortization of the content library of 2034 million which increased by 623 million over the prior period as we continue to purchase additional titles including internetdelivered content in 2007 in order to support our larger subscriber base cash provided by operating activities increased 440 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 this was primarily due to an increase in net income of 179 million increased noncash adjustments of 312 million and a decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 51 million

we continue to purchase additional titles including internetdelivered content in 2007 for our content library in order to support our larger subscriber base content acquisitions were 539 million higher in 2007 as compared to 2006 purchases of property and equipment consisted of expenditures related to company expansion primarily to our headquarters in los gatos california in march 2006 we exercised our option to lease a building adjacent to our headquarters in los gatos california the building will comprise approximately 80000 square feet of office space and have an initial term of 5 years the building is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008 additionally purchases of property and equipment consisted of automation equipment for our various shipping centers in order to achieve increased operational efficiencies

financing activities 

our financing activities consisted primarily of issuance of common stock repurchases of our common stock and the excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation cash provided by financing activities decreased by 1902 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to stock repurchases of 999 million in 2007 and a decrease of 1034 million in issuances of common stock as we had raised 1011 million in a secondary offering in 2006 on april 18 2007 we announced a stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to 1000 million of our common stock through the end of 2007 as of november 2007 we completed our stock repurchase program we did not have any stock repurchases during 2006 this use of cash was offset by the excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 262 million 

cash provided by financing activities increased 1129 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the proceeds of 1011 million from the secondary public offering of our common stock in may 2006 as well as 132 million of tax benefits from stockbased compensation

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 141r business combinations sfas no 141r to replace sfas no 141 business combinations  sfas no 141r requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting defines the acquirer establishes the acquisition date and broadens the scope to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 159 allows companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the statement requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected to be reported in earnings sfas no 159 also amends certain provisions of sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 although earlier adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas no 157 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities this framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards which permit or in some cases require estimates of fair market value sfas no 157 was effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years earlier application is encouraged provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year in december 2007 the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position “fsp” no 157b fsp no 157b which would delay the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis fsp no 157b partially defers the effective date of sfas no 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp no 157b we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  specifically the pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the interpretation also provides guidance on the related derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting for interim periods 

  

disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions the interpretation was effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk to achieve this objective we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities these securities are classified as availableforsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet 

some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline to minimize this risk we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities at december 31 2007 our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate our shortterm investments were comprised of corporate debt securities government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities the majority of the portfolio is invested in “aaa” rated residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities a hypothetical 100 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair market value of our shortterm investments of approximately 35 million

our core strategy is to grow a large dvd subscription business and to expand into internetbased movie delivery as that market develops we believe that the dvd format along with its successor formats of hd dvd and bluray will continue to be the main vehicle for watching movies in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large dvd subscription business we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to internetbased movie delivery as it becomes a mainstream method for movie distribution to this end we introduced a new feature in january 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers we expect to roll out this instantviewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch and we will continue to improve its quality content and functionality we intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time 

our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandise our comprehensive library of dvds we believe that our recommendation technology based on proprietary algorithms and the approximately 17 billion movie ratings we have collected from our subscribers enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization 

we continually invest in improvements to our service in an effort to deepen our subscriber relationships as well as to further distinguish our service from that of our competitors we focus on improving our website 

  

experience and functionality and seek to create valueadded features for our subscribers such as our social networking feature called friends r and our queue management feature called profiles sm  in addition we generate a small portion of our revenue from the sale of advertising

industry overview 

filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels outofhome channels include movie theaters airlines and hotels inhome distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets cable and satellite television payperview videoondemand or vod and broadcast television currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market seven to nine months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks however in what continues to be an emerging trend the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window we anticipate that the studios will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window including releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod but we believe that dvd and its high definition successors hddvd and bluray will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits dvd generates for the studios 

challenges faced by consumers in selecting inhome filmed entertainment 

the proliferation of new releases available for inhome filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalog titles on dvd create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles 

first despite the large number of available titles on dvd consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets subscription channels payperview and videoondemand services continue to offer a narrow selection of titles likewise traditional video rental outlets 

  

primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalog titles we believe our selection of over 70000 titles on dvd offers an attractive alternative to these traditional channels 

second even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service and our website features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences we also recently launched our previews feature which allows subscribers to conveniently and efficiently browse through promotional trailers of movies they may find appealing and directly add them to their queue 

competitive strengths 

we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths

our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database this technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber 

we believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber 

  

our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers we use a realtime postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to promote speedy and accurate delivery subscribers pay for our service primarily by a credit or debit card we utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods

merchandising

we also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy this information may include 

 

  

  

 marketing 

we have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service online advertising is an important channel for acquiring new subscribers we advertise our service online through paid search listings banner ads text on popular web portals and other web sites and permission based emails in addition we have an affiliate program whereby we make available webbased banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a selfassisted basis from our web site and place on their web sites we also advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations we utilize direct mail and print advertising as well as promote our services in certain consumer package goods we also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studio’s movies in netflix promotional advertising we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of wordofmouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs 

  

content acquisition 

we acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time after the revenue sharing period expires for a title we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio destroying the title or purchasing the title the principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio in addition to revenue sharing agreements we also purchase titles from various studios distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis for titles delivered through our instantviewing feature we license content on a fixed fee or perview basis from various studios and other content providers

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy or download a dvd from walmart or amazon and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month 

video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include blockbuster movie gallery amazoncom walmart stores and best buy we believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection convenience and price we believe that our scalable business model our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 70000 dvd titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets and retailers 

we also compete against other online dvd subscription services such as blockbuster online subscription entertainment services such as hbo and showtime payperview and vod providers and cable and satellite providers it remains possible that other potential online entrants will offer competing services either directly or in conjunction with others 

  

in late 2006 blockbuster launched its integrated storebased and online program total access whereby blockbuster online subscribers may return dvds delivered to them from blockbuster online to blockbuster stores in exchange for an instore rental this latest initiative by blockbuster follows a similar initiative aimed at leveraging their storebased business with their online offering through the use of coupons for free instore rentals for online subscribers as of year end blockbuster has grown their online business to approximately 2 million subscribers we have seen blockbuster aggressively promote their total access program through instore promotions and signups as well as advertising on television and other massmedia channels 

we believe we are able to provide greater satisfaction for consumers who subscribe to our service due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental the broad and deep selection of dvd titles we offer subscribers our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences the unique features we offer subscribers such as our instantviewing feature previews friends r and profiles sm  as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select receive and return dvds we continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business 

vod and downloading of movies over the internet continues to receive considerable media attention apple’s video ipod amazon’s unbox walmart’s dvd download offerings and announcements from other companies ranging from google and yahoo to microsoft and intel regarding their efforts in digital delivery of content fuels public interest in the future of video entertainment delivery progress in digital delivery although slow and scattered continues to be made vod for example is now widely available to digital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas such as new york boston los angeles and san francisco downloading of movies over the internet to a personal computer is currently available from providers such as itunes vongo movielink and cinemanow to this end we introduced a new feature in january 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers we expect to roll out this instantviewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch and we will continue to improve its quality content and functionality we intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time 

while we anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years we believe that dvd and its high definition successors hddvd and bluray will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term at some point in the future digital delivery directly to the home will surpass dvd our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences and our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for dvd rentals positions us favorably to further develop our digital distribution offering as that market develops the downloading market is segmented into rental of online delivered content the downloadtoown segment and the advertisingsupported online delivery segment and we believe we will lead the rental segment with our instantviewing feature as it develops 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had 1300 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments as of december 31 2006 we had 646 temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

intellectual property 

we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we have filed patents in the us and abroad in the us we were issued broad business method patents covering among other things our subscription rental service in 2003 and 2006 and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005 while our patents are an important element of our business our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a 

  

combination of patents we have a registered service mark for the netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks our software the content of our web site and other material which we create is protected by copyright we also protect certain details about our business methods processes and strategies as trade secrets and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 

our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming to date we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and knowhow to protect our intellectual property it is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage 

from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute

 item 1a risk factors tableend if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

risks related to our business 

if our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful our revenues will be adversely affected 

we must continue to attract new subscribers to succeed we must continue to attract a large number of subscribers who have traditionally used video retailers video rental outlets cable channels such as hbo and showtime payperview and vod for inhome filmed entertainment in addition we face direct competition to our service namely from services like blockbuster online that will likely impact our ability to attract subscribers our ability to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting viewing receiving and returning titles including providing accurate recommendations through our recommendation service furthermore the relative service levels pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract subscribers if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract subscribers in addition many of our new subscribers originate from wordofmouth advertising and referrals from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract new subscribers and as a result our revenues will be adversely affected 

if we experience excessive rates of churn our revenues and business will be harmed 

we must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently delivery takes too long the service is a poor value competitive services provide a better value andor experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our churn will likely increase and our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies for delivery of inhome filmed entertainment such as vod and digital delivery of content over the internet continue to receive considerable media and investor attention many of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do the rapid growth of our online entertainment subscription business since our inception may continue to attract direct competition from larger companies with significantly greater financial resources and national brand recognition we could also face competition from potential new entrants into the online dvd rental or movie download markets for example we have seen the entry of direct competition from blockbuster which launched its online service in august 2004 and continues to augment its online offering with differentiated services such as its total access program which allows customers to exchange online rentals with instore rentals in addition apple’s video ipod amazon’s unbox walmart’s dvd download offerings and announcements from other companies ranging from google and yahoo to microsoft and intel regarding their efforts in digital delivery of content highlight the extremely dynamic environment in which we operate our 

  

business if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

in addition many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy or download a dvd from walmart or amazon and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost dvds and downloading represent only two of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing filmed entertainment in addition the growth in adoption of dvd and downloading technology is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors programs and technologies we may not be able to achieve adequate market share increase our revenues or maintain profitability our principal competitors include or could include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and web site and systems development than we do there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current or new competitors at our existing pricing levels or at even lower price points in the future furthermore we may need to adjust the level of service provided to our subscribers andor incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate as a result of increased competition we may see a reduction in operating margins and market share 

if vod or other technologies are more widely adopted and supported as a method of content delivery by the studios and consumers our business could be adversely affected 

some digital cable providers and internet content providers have implemented technology referred to as vod this technology transmits movies and other entertainment content on demand with interactive capabilities such as start stop and rewind highspeed internet access has greatly increased the speed and quality of viewing vod content including featurelength movies on personal computers over the internet in addition other technologies have been developed that allow alternative means for consumers to receive and watch movies or other entertainment such as on cell phones or other handheld devices such as apple’s ipod although we anticipate providing solutions for online delivery of content as evidenced by the recent launch of our instantviewing feature vod or other technologies may become more affordable and viable alternative methods of content delivery that are widely supported by studios and adopted by consumers if this happens more quickly than we anticipate or more quickly than our own online delivery offerings or if other providers are better able to meet studio and consumer needs and expectations our business could be adversely affected 

  

if the popularity of the dvd format decreases our business could be adversely affected 

consumers have rapidly adopted the dvd format for viewing inhome filmed entertainment at present dvd sales account for approximately 43 of studio revenues while the growth of dvd sales has slowed we believe that the dvd format including any successor formats such as hddvd and bluray will be valuable longterm consumer propositions and studio profit centers however if dvd sales were to decrease whether because of a shift away from movie watching or because new or existing technologies were to become more popular at the expense of dvd enjoyment studios and retailers may reduce their support of the dvd format our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by future popularity of the dvd format and if such popularity wanes our subscriber growth may also slow 

we depend on studios to release titles on dvd for an exclusive time period following theatrical release 

our ability to attract and retain subscribers is related to our ability to offer new releases of filmed entertainment on dvds prior to their release to other distribution channels except for theatrical release dvds currently enjoy a significant competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early distribution window for dvds the window for dvd rental and retail sales is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview premium television basic cable and network and syndicated television the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies our business could suffer increased competition if 

 

  

 the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the title and we cannot assure you that the studios will not change their policies in the future in a manner that would be adverse to our business and results of operations currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market seven to nine months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks in what continues to be an emerging trend however the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window in addition some studios have discussed eliminating the release window on certain titles in particular releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod 

if us copyright law were altered to amend or eliminate the first sale doctrine or if studios were to release titles on dvd in a manner that attempts to circumvent or limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected 

under us copyright law once a copyright owner sells a copy of his work to another the copyright owner relinquishes all further rights to sell or otherwise dispose of that copy while the copyright owner retains the underlying copyright to the expression fixed in the work the copyright owner gives up his ability to control the fate of the work once it had been sold as such once a dvd is sold into the market those obtaining the dvd are permitted to resell it rent it or otherwise dispose of it if congress or the courts were to change or substantially limit this first sale doctrine our ability to obtain content and then rent it could be adversely affected likewise if studios agree to limit the sale of their content in ways that try to limit the affects of the first sale doctrine our business could be adversely affected for example in late 2006 the weinstein company announced an arrangement with blockbuster by which weinstein would distribute content on dvds for rental exclusively by blockbuster in so doing they contractually prohibited certain distributors from selling the dvds to rental establishments nonetheless the content was being distributed to retail vendors and distributors while this structure does not prohibit us from obtaining and renting weinstein dvds under the first sale doctrine it does impact our ability to obtain weinstein content in the most efficient manner and in some cases in enough quantities to satisfy demand if such arrangements were to become more commonplace or if additional impediments to obtaining content were created our ability to obtain content could be impacted and our business could be adversely affected 

  

if we experience increased demand for titles which we are unable to offset with increased subscriber retention or operating margins our operating results may be adversely affected 

with our unlimited plans there is no established limit to the number of movies that subscribers may rent we are continually adjusting our service in ways that may impact subscriber movie usage such adjustments include new web site features and merchandising practices computerbased instant viewing of select titles through our instantviewing feature an expanded dvd distribution network and software and process changes in addition demand for titles may increase for a variety of reasons beyond our control including promotion by studios and seasonal variations or shifts in consumer movie watching 

if our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of any increased operating costs associated with increased usage our operating results will be adversely affected in addition our subscriber growth and retention may be adversely affected if we attempt to alter our service or increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles 

if our subscribers select titles or formats that are more expensive for us to acquire and deliver more frequently our expenses may increase 

certain titles cost us more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they are acquired and the terms on which they are acquired if subscribers select these titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected our revenue sharing and other content acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected in addition films released on the new high definition dvd formats hddvd and bluray and those released for online delivery may be more expensive to acquire than in dvd format the rate of customer acceptance and adoption of these new formats is uncertain if subscribers select these formats on a proportional basis more often than the existing dvd format our dvd acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected 

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the netflix brand is still developing and we must continue to build strong brand identity to succeed we must continue to attract and retain a large number of owners of dvd players who have traditionally relied on storebased rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service through our web site in addition we will have to compete for subscribers against other brands which have greater recognition than ours such as blockbuster we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will only increase in light of competition both for online subscription services and other means of distributing titles such as vod from timetotime our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among other things our inventory allocation and delivery processing to the extent dissatisfaction with our service is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including third party banner ads popunder placements direct links and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including television and radio advertising direct mail and print campaigns consumer package and mailing insertions we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership we maintain an active public relations program to 

  

increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide to enter our business or a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such channels in addition if ad rates increase we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise experience an increase in our cost per subscriber laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of email and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be adversely affected 

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 we anticipate further expanding our operations to help grow our subscriber base and to take advantage of favorable market opportunities any future expansion will likely place significant demands on our managerial operational administrative and financial resources if we are not able to respond effectively to new or increased demands that arise because of our growth or if in responding our management is materially distracted from our current operations our business may be adversely affected in addition if we do not have sufficient breadth and depth of dvd and online titles necessary to satisfy increased demand arising from growth in our subscriber base our subscriber satisfaction may be adversely affected 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we use complex proprietary software to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations our proprietary technology is intended to allow our nationwide network of shipping centers to be operated on an integrated basis we continually enhance or modify the software used for our distribution operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers future enhancements and modifications to our proprietary technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of dvds among our shipping centers in a timely and efficient manner our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired in addition through our new instantviewing feature our subscribers will access titles on our web site through our proprietary movie player software and must maintain their connection to our web site for an uninterrupted viewing experience if this proprietary software fails to satisfactorily display the available titles our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired also any harm to our subscribers’ personal computers caused by the proprietary software could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet 

  

our shipping needs including delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather natural disasters labor activism health epidemics or bioterrorism our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit and marketing expenses 

increases in postage delivery rates could adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase the us postal service increased the rate for first class postage on january 8 2006 by 2 cents from 37 cents to 39 cents and proposed another increase in the amount of 3 cents if approved the increase is expected to take place in mid2007 in addition the us congress recently passed postal reform legislation which provides the us postal service with more flexibility in establishing postal rates it is unclear at this point the extent to which this new legislation may impact our operations and costs but it does appear that the expected 2007 increase in postage will take place the us postal service continues to focus on plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds and our gross margin could be adversely affected also if the us postal service curtails its services such as by closing facilities or discontinuing or reducing saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be adversely affected 

currently most filmed entertainment is packaged on a single lightweight dvd our delivery process is designed to accommodate the delivery of one dvd to fulfill a selection because of the lightweight nature of a dvd we generally mail one dvd per envelope using standard us postage studios occasionally provide additional content on a second dvd or may package a title on two dvds in addition the studios have begun to release certain films in high definition format on hddvds and bluray dvds these new dvds have characteristics that are different than those currently in circulation these highdefinition format dvds may be heavier andor more fragile than current dvds if packaging of filmed entertainment on multiple dvds were to become more prevalent if the weight of dvds were to increase or the durability of dvds deteriorate our costs of delivery and fulfillment processing would increase and our costs of replacing damaged dvds may rise materially which would depress gross margins and profitability and adversely affect free cash flow 

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation service our business may suffer 

based on proprietary algorithms our recommendation service enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandise our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation service to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure you that the proprietary algorithms in our recommendation service will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

we are continually refining our recommendation service in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers for example in 2006 we launched a contest intended to encourage the development of algorithms that will significantly improve the predictive accuracy of our recommendation service and we intend to use the results of this contest to further refine its utility we may experience difficulties in implementing refinements in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation service 

  

if our recommendation service does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

 

  

  

 if we do not correctly anticipate our short and longterm needs for dvd titles our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we do not acquire sufficient copies of dvds we may not satisfy subscriber demand and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be adversely affected conversely if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be adversely affected our ability to accurately predict subscriber demand as well as market factors such as exclusive distribution arrangements may impact our ability to acquire appropriate quantities of certain dvds 

if we are unable to renew or renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us or if the cost of purchasing titles on a wholesale basis increases our gross margins may be adversely affected 

we acquire dvds through a mix of revenue sharing agreements as well as direct purchase arrangements whether we enter into a direct purchase or revenue sharing arrangement depends on the economic terms we can negotiate as well as studio preferences starting in 2000 we entered into numerous revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors which typically enabled us to increase our copy depth of dvds on an economical basis because of a low initial payment with additional payments made only if our subscribers rent the dvd during the course of our revenue sharing relationships various contract administration issues can arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors may be adversely impacted 

as the revenue sharing agreements expire we must renegotiate new terms or shift to direct purchasing arrangements under which we must pay the full wholesale price regardless of whether the dvd is rented we have seen the purchase mix shift toward direct purchasing arrangements as revenue sharing agreements expire if we cannot renegotiate purchasing arrangements on favorable terms the cost of acquiring content could increase and our gross margins may be adversely affected in addition the risk associated with accurately predicting title demand could increase if we are required to directly purchase more titles 

if the sales price of dvds to retail consumers decreases our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected 

the cost of manufacturing dvds is substantially less than the price for which new dvds are generally sold in the retail market thus we believe that studios and other resellers of dvds have significant flexibility in pricing dvds for retail sale if the retail price of dvds decreases significantly consumers may choose to purchase dvds instead of subscribing to our service 

we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 

from time to time we may seek to obtain additional capital either through equity equitylinked or debt securities the decision to obtain additional capital will depend among other things on our development efforts 

  

business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

any significant disruption in service on our web site or in our computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers 

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site where the title selection process is integrated with our delivery processing systems and software our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our web site network infrastructure and fulfillment processes interruptions in these systems could make our web site unavailable and hinder our ability to fulfill selections much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems in addition through our new instantviewing feature our subscribers will access titles on our web site through our proprietary movie player software and must maintain their connection to our web site for an uninterrupted viewing experience service interruptions errors in our software or the unavailability of our web site could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our web site service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our web site or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our communications hardware and the computer hardware used to operate our web site and our online delivery of content are hosted at the facilities of a third party provider hardware for our delivery systems is maintained in our shipping centers fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business problems faced by our third party web hosting provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its customers including us could adversely impact the experience of our subscribers 

our executive offices and our sunnyvalebased shipping center are located in the san francisco bay area in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations would be adversely affected 

our executive offices and our sunnyvalebased shipping center are located in the san francisco bay area our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of electrical blackouts fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations due to disruptions in service in the san francisco bay area or any other facility because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our sunnyvalebased operations center and the surrounding transportation infrastructure we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes 

  

the loss of our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief marketing officer or our failure to attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business and new service developments 

we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board barry mccarthy our chief financial officer and leslie j kilgore our chief marketing officer in addition much of our key technology and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data 

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendation service we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

to secure transmission of confidential information obtained by us for billing purposes including subscribers’ credit card or checking account data we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology in conjunction with the payment processing companies we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data if despite these measures we experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers and our business could be adversely affected similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

in addition because we obtain subscribers’ billing information on our web site we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

increases in payment processing fees or changes to operating rules would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit cards and to a lesser extent electronic checks our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis these fees may increase in 2007 such increase may adversely affect our results of operations 

we are subject to rules regulations and practices governing our accepted payment methods which are predominately credit cards and debit cards and to a lesser extent electronic checks these rules regulations and 

  

practices could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept these payment methods and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings such as our complaint for patent infringement against blockbuster inc filed in april 2006 netflix is a registered trademark of netflix inc in the united states and united kingdom we have also filed trademark applications in the united states for the friends and profiles service marks and for the netflix design logo and have filed us patent applications for certain aspects of our technology we have also filed a trademark application in the european union for the netflix name from time to time we expect to file additional trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site our recommendation service title selection processes and marketing activities 

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights or develop noninfringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be adversely affected many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site or our recommendation service or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be adversely affected 

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by 

  

governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable without significant cost or at all to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

forecasting film revenue and associated gross profits from our films prior to release is extremely difficult and may result in significant writeoffs 

we are required to amortize capitalized film production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from the associated films the amount of film production costs that will be amortized each period depends on how much future revenue we expect to receive from each film unamortized film production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a filmbyfilm basis if estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized film production costs the unamortized film production costs will be written down to fair value in any given period if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film we would be required to accelerate amortization of related film costs such accelerated amortization would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition in addition we base our estimates of revenue on performance of comparable titles and our knowledge of the industry if the information is incorrect the amount of revenue and related expenses that we recognize from our films could be wrong which could result in fluctuations in our earnings 

if we become subject to liability for content that we publish or distribute through our service our results of operations would be adversely affected 

as a publisher of content a host of third party content and a distributor of content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute for example our whollyowned subsidiary red envelope entertainment llc which is dedicated to acquiring and funding original content productions may be exposed to liability for copyright infringement and other claims relating to the original content we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews 

if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover claims of these types or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed on us 

if government regulation of the internet or other areas of our business changes or if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change we may need to change the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

the manner in which internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the adoption of any laws or regulations that 

  

adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet including laws limiting internet neutrality could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business in addition if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change consumers may become unwilling to select their entertainment online or otherwise provide us with information necessary for them to become subscribers further we may not be able to effectively market our services online to users of the internet if we are unable to interact with consumers because of changes in their attitude toward use of the internet our subscriber acquisition and retention may be adversely affected 

we may be engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position such disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs 

changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and recentlyenacted rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission have increased and may continue to increase our expenses as we evaluate the implications of these rules and devote resources to respond to their requirements 

the nasdaq global select market on which our common stock is listed has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which would adversely affect our business 

risks related to our stock ownership 

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over netflix 

as of december 31 2006 our executive officers and directors their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 30 percent of our outstanding common stock and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days in particular jay hoag one of our directors beneficially owned approximately 21 percent and reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board beneficially owned approximately 7 percent these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from yours and will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

 

   

  

  

  

 in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 percent or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

our stock price is volatile 

the price at which our common stock has traded since our may 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

during the second quarter of 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation ” “sfas 123” for stockbased employee compensation in addition during the third quarter of 2003 we began granting stock options to our employees on a monthly basis the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately in comparison with the three to fouryear vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expenses determined under sfas no 123 are fully recognized in the same periods as the monthly stock option grants in addition we continue to amortize the deferred compensation of stock options with three to fouryear vesting periods granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 over the remaining vesting periods our stockbased compensation expenses totaled 166 million 143 million and 127 million during 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively we expect our stockbased compensation 

  

expenses will continue to be significant in future periods which will have an adverse impact on our operating results the blackscholes optionpricing model used by us requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect the fair value estimate of stockbased payments our operating income net income and net income per share 

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues gross margin operating expenses number of paying subscribers number of dvds shipped per day and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

our business 

we are the largest online movie rental subscription service providing more than 6300000 subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than 70000 movie television and other filmed entertainment titles on dvd we offer a variety of subscription plans starting at 499 a month there are no due dates no late fees and no shipping fees subscribers select titles at our web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service receive them on dvd by us mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers after a dvd has been returned we mail the next available dvd in a subscriber’s queue the terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at wwwnetflixcomtermsofuse 

we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees our business has grown rapidly since inception resulting in substantially increased revenues our growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of dvds as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online dvd rentals we expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online dvd rentals continues to grow a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model 

we continued to see strong growth in 2006 with revenues achieving 46 growth from a year ago this growth can be attributed to an expanding subscriber base we added approximately 21 million net new subscribers in 2006 growing from 42 million at december 31 2005 to 63 million subscribers at december 31 2006 

recent developments and initiatives 

we continue to face direct competition from blockbuster it remains possible that other potential entrants will offer competing services either directly or in conjunction with others or that blockbuster will gain more traction in its current business we continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business 

our core strategy is to grow a large dvd subscription business and to expand into internetbased movie delivery as that market develops we believe that the dvd format along with its successor formats of hd dvd 

  

and bluray will continue to be the main vehicle for watching movies in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large dvd subscription business we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to internetbased movie delivery as it becomes a mainstream method for movie distribution to this end we introduced a new feature in january 2007 that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers we expect to roll out this instantviewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch and we will continue to improve its quality content and functionality we intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time 

key business metrics 

management periodically reviews certain key business metrics within the context of our articulated performance goals in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business the key business metrics include the following 

 

  

  

 management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the securities and exchange commission has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

amortization of dvd library and upfront costs 

we acquire dvds from studios and distributors through either direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements we acquire dvds for the purpose of renting them to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such we consider our dvd library to be a productive asset and classify our dvd library as a noncurrent asset additionally in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards 95 “statement of cash flows” “sfas 95” we classify cash outflows for the acquisition of the dvd library net of changes in related accounts payable as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows this is inclusive of any upfront nonrefundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements 

we amortize our dvd library less estimated salvage value on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over its estimated useful life the useful life of the newrelease dvds and backcatalog dvds is estimated to be 1 year and 3 years respectively in estimating the useful life of our dvd library we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds volume purchase discounts received from studios on the purchase of titles are recorded as a reduction of dvd library inventory when earned 

  

prior to july 1 2004 we amortized the cost of our entire dvd library including the capitalized portion of the initial fixed license fee on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over one year however based on a periodic evaluation of both new release and backcatalog utilization for amortization purposes we determined that backcatalog titles have a significantly longer life than previously estimated as a result we revised the estimate of useful life for the backcatalog dvd library from a “sum of the months” accelerated method using a one year life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a threeyear life the purpose of this change was to more accurately reflect the productive life of these assets in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 20 accounting changes “apb 20” the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis from july 1 2004 new releases will continue to be amortized over a one year period as a result of the change in the estimated life of the backcatalog library total cost of revenues was 109 million lower net income was 109 million higher and net income per diluted share was 017 higher for the year ended december 31 2004 

in the third quarter of 2004 we determined that we were selling fewer previously rented dvds than estimated but at an average selling price higher than historically estimated we therefore revised our estimate of salvage values on direct purchase dvds for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives a salvage value of 300 per dvd has been provided effective july 1 2004 for those dvds that we do not expect to sell no salvage value is provided simultaneously with the change in accounting estimate of expected salvage values we recorded a writeoff of approximately 19 million related to nonrecoverable salvage value in the third quarter of 2004 

revenue sharing agreements enable us to obtain dvds at a lower upfront cost than under traditional direct purchase arrangements under revenue sharing agreements we share a percentage of the actual net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with the studios over a fixed period of time or the title term which is typically between 6 and 12 months for each dvd title at the end of the title term we generally have the option of returning the dvd title to the studio destroying the title or purchasing the title in addition we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our dvd library amortization policy in some cases this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred 

we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvd library 

stockbased compensation 

we adopted the provisions of sfas 123r on january 1 2006 under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period which is the vesting period we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 in the second quarter of 2003 and restated prior periods at that time because the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 and sfas 123r were materially consistent under our equity plans the adoption of sfas 123r did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock in light of the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” we reevaluated the assumptions used to estimate the value of stock options beginning in the second quarter of 2005 

 

   

  

 we grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis such stock options are designated as nonqualified stock options and vest immediately as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expense determined under sfas 123r is fully recognized upon the stock option grants and no estimate is required for prevesting option forfeitures 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

at december 31 2004 our deferred tax assets primarily the tax benefits of loss carryforwards were offset in full by a valuation allowance because of our history of losses through the first quarter of 2003 limited profitable quarters to date and the competitive landscape of online dvd rentals as a result of our analysis of expected future income at december 31 2005 it was considered more likely than not that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was no longer required resulting in the release of a previously recorded allowance generating a 349 million tax benefit as of december 31 2006 deferred tax assets do not include the tax benefits attributable to approximately 56 million of excess tax deductions related to stock options these benefits will only be recorded when realized on tax returns and will be credited to equity at that time 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented the line items in our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 revenues 

 

 we currently generate all of our revenues in the united states we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscriber’s monthly subscription period in addition we generate a small portion of our revenues from the sale of advertising 

the increase in our revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily a result of the substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers as summarized in the table above offset in part by a decline in average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber we believe the increase in the number of paying 

  

subscribers was driven primarily by increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online dvd rentals and continuing improvements in our service the decline in the average monthly revenue per paying subscriber was a result of the continued popularity of our lower cost subscription plans we expect the average revenue per paying subscriber to continue to decline as we promote our lower priced subscription plans 

the increase in our revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers offset in part by a decline in average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber we believe the increase in the number of paying subscribers was driven primarily by increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online dvd rentals and continuing improvements in our service the decline in the average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber was a result of the price decrease of our most popular subscription plan coupled with the increased promotion of our lower cost subscription plans in june 2004 we increased the monthly subscription price of our most popular subscription plan from 1995 to 2199 however effective november 2004 we lowered the price of the most popular subscription plan to 1799 in addition we introduced new lower priced subscription plans in the second quarter of 2005 

churn declined to 39 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 40 percent in the same period of 2005 and from 44 percent in the same period of 2004 we believe the decline was primarily due to the following factors

 the increase in cost of subscription in absolute dollars for 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 fulfillment expenses 

 

 the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers coupled with an increase in credit card fees as a result of the increase in subscriptions in addition the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facilityrelated costs resulting from the expansion of certain of our shipping centers and the addition of new ones we anticipate that fulfillment expenses will increase in 2007 as new shipping centers are added

gross margin 

 

 the increase in gross margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in revenue sharing cost per paid shipment which includes a decline in the percentage of dvds subject to revenue sharing agreements mailed to paying subscribers as well as an increase in revenue per paid shipment as a result of a decline in overall usage and the continued popularity of our lowerpriced plans the increase in postage rates by 2 cents effective january 8 2006 negatively impacted gross margin however this impact was offset by a decline in fulfillment costs as a result of increased operational efficiencies 

the decline in gross margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to the increase in cost of subscription offset in part by a decrease in fulfillment expenses as a percentage of revenue cost of subscription increased due to a decline in revenue per paid shipment as a result of the price decrease of our most popular service plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2004 offset partially by the change in estimate related to the useful life of our backcatalog dvd library and the rapid growth of lower priced plans which produce a higher margin than our most popular subscription plan of 1799 per month in addition the gross margin for 2004 was favorably impacted by certain credits received from studios resulting from amendments to revenue sharing agreements 

if movie rentals per average paying subscriber increases or if we see more shipments of dvds subject to revenue sharing and the revenue sharing cost per shipment does not decline erosion in our gross margin will occur additionally in 2006 the us postal service proposed an increase in the rate of first class postage in the amount of 3 cents if approved the increase is expected to take place in mid2007 the anticipated increase in postage rates is expected to reduce our gross margin 

in january 2007 we introduced our instantviewing feature which is being made available to subscribers in a phased rollout during 2007 we anticipate incurring at least 40 million in additional expenses related to our instant viewing feature as a result we anticipate that cost of subscription will increase as a percentage of revenue resulting in a decline in gross margin in 2007 

operating expenses 

technology and development 

 

 the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of an increase in personnel and facilityrelated costs as well as to the development of our instantviewing feature as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses decreased from 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than technology and development expenses 

the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2005 as compared 2004 was primarily the result of an increase in personnelrelated and systems infrastructure costs as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than technology and development expenses 

  

we continuously research and test a variety of potential improvements to our internal hardware and software systems in an effort to improve our productivity and enhance our subscribers’ experience additionally we continue to develop and enhance solutions for the online delivery of content to our subscribers as a result we expect our technology and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in 2007 

marketing 

 

 the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing program costs which included direct mail online advertising and television advertising to attract new subscribers as a percentage of revenues marketing expenses increased primarily due to a greater increase in marketing expenses than revenues subscriber acquisition cost increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in marketing program spending offset in part by a decrease in cost of providing free trials associated with our lower priced plans coupled with a slight decline in personnelrelated costs 

the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing program costs primarily direct mail radio television and online advertising to attract new subscribers as a percentage of revenues the increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in marketing expenses than revenues subscriber acquisition cost increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to an increase in overall marketing program spending and spending on a per acquired subscriber basis offset partially by a decrease in the cost of providing free trials associated with our new lower priced plans and by a 21 million reduction in liability due to the final settlement of certain marketing programs 

we anticipate that our marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in 2007 as we grow our business 

general and administrative 

 

 the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to ongoing legal proceedings personnel costs and professional fees to support our growing operations as a percentage of revenues the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than general and administrative expenses 

  

the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to an increase in legal costs as well as an increase in personnelrelated costs insurance costs and professional fees to support our growing operations general and administrative costs in 2005 included an accrual of 81 million net of expected insurance proceeds for reimbursement of legal defense costs of 09 million related to the proposed settlement costs of the chavez vs netflix inc lawsuit as a percentage of revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in general and administrative expenses than increase in revenues

interest and other income 

 

 the increase in interest and other income in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents due to increased interest rates as well as higher average cash balances resulting from a net increase in cash flows and net proceeds of 1011 million from the secondary public offering of our common stock in may 2006 

the increase in interest and other income in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents due to increased interest rates as well as higher average cash balances 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

 

   

in 2006 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to state income taxes and benefits related to stockbased compensation in 2005 we recorded an income tax benefit of 337 million on pretax income of 83 million our 2005 income tax benefit includes a tax benefit for the reduction in the valuation allowance of 349 million we continuously monitor the circumstances impacting the expected realization of our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005 we reduced the valuation allowance after determining that substantially all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realizable due to expected future income in 2004 we recorded an income tax provision of 02 million on a pretax income of 218 million our effective tax rates for 2004 and 2005 differ from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and benefits related to stock based compensation 

we currently anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 40 in 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents of 4004 million on may 3 2006 we issued 35 million shares of common stock upon the closing of a secondary public offering for net proceeds of 1011 million we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock for general corporate purposes including working capital 

we have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001 many factors will impact our ability to continue to generate and grow cash from our operations including but not limited to the number of subscribers who sign up for our service the growth or reduction in our subscriber base and our ability to develop new revenue sources in addition we may have to or otherwise choose to lower our prices and increase our marketing expenses in order to grow faster or respond to competition although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with our available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 

key components of cash flow 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities 

 

 in the third quarter of 2006 we began classifying changes in accounts payable related to the acquisition of our dvd library and property and equipment as a component of cash outflows related to investing activities changes in accounts payable related to acquisitions of dvd library and property and equipment were previously classified within cash flows from operating activities accordingly the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by 904 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 the increase in operating cash was primarily attributable to the increase in net income the increase in amortization of dvd library as a result of increased purchases of titles increase in depreciation of property and equipment increase in deferred revenue due to a larger subscriber base and increase in gift subscriptions and increases in accrued expenses as a result of our growing operations 

  

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 122 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase in operating cash was primarily attributable to the increase in net income the increase in amortization of dvd library as a result of increased purchases of titles increase in depreciation of property and equipment increase in deferred revenue due to a larger subscriber base and increase in gift subscriptions and increases in accrued expenses as a result of our growing operations 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by 526 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 the increase was primarily attributable to increased purchases of titles for our dvd library to support our larger subscriber base and increased purchases of property and equipment to support our growing operations 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 670 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase was primarily because cash used in investing activities in 2004 included net proceeds of 450 million from the sale of our shortterm investments excluding the impact of the net proceeds from the sale of our shortterm investments cash used in investing activities increased by 220 million primarily due to increased purchases of titles for our dvd library to support our larger subscriber base and increased purchases of property and equipment to support our growing operations in 2005 as compared to 2004 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by 1129 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the proceeds of 1011 million from the secondary public offering of our common stock in may 2006 as well as 132 million of tax benefits from stockbased compensation

  for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2006 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities accordingly our operating results financial condition and cash flows are not subject to offbalance sheet risks 

  

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 

the terms of such obligations vary generally a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated so the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated to date we have not incurred material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas no 157 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities this framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards which permit or in some cases require estimates of fair market value sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years earlier application is encouraged provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes  specifically the pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the interpretation also provides guidance on the related derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting for interim periods disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 accounting for certain hybrid instruments which amends sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis sfas no 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas no 133 and sfas no 140 this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline to minimize this risk we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of securities at december 31 2006 our cash equivalents are generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend  

 our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on that evaluation and the remediation of the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 as described below our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within netflix have been detected 

material weakness previously identified 

as previously reported in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2005 management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our accounting for income taxes specifically our policies and procedures did not include adequate management review of the calculations and related supporting documentation to ensure that its accounting for income taxes is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles this material weakness resulted in a material error in the company’s consolidated financial statements related to the understatement of deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheet and the understatement of the benefit from income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations this error was corrected prior to the filing of our 2005 form 10k 

the foregoing led our management to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2005 because of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in the internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” 

remediation of material weakness 

in the first quarter of 2006 we implemented additional review procedures to ensure complete supporting documentation is available to ensure that our accounting for income taxes is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles this action was in place in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the first quarter of 2006 as such we believe that the remediation initiative outlined above was sufficient to eliminate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as discussed above 

  

 our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework  based on our assessment under the framework in internal control – integrated framework  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006 our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report that is included herein 

 

 there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2006 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

our subscription service has grown rapidly since its launch in late 1999 this growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of dvds as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online dvd rentals we also believe our growth has been driven by our comprehensive selection of titles consistently high levels of customer satisfaction and our effective marketing programs we expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online dvd rentals continues to grow a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model 

  

our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandize our comprehensive library of titles we believe that our recommendation technology based on proprietary algorithms and the approximately one billion movie ratings we have collected from our subscribers enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization 

  

we continually invest in improvements to our service in an effort to deepen our subscriber relationships as well as to further distinguish our service from that of our competitors we focus on improving our website experience and functionality and seek to create valueadded features for our subscribers such as our social networking feature called friends sm and our queue management feature called profiles sm  in addition we continue to focus on the new revenue initiatives launched in the second quarter of 2005 retail sales of previouslyviewed dvds and our ad sales program we also continue to invest resources to develop solutions for downloading movies to consumers our core strategy has been and remains to grow a large dvd subscription business however as technology and infrastructure develop to allow effective and convenient delivery of movies over the internet and when meaningful content becomes available we intend to offer our subscribers the choice of receiving their movies on dvd or by downloading whichever they prefer 

  

we promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs including online promotions television and radio advertising package inserts direct mail and other promotions with third parties these 

  

programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period of 14 days at the end of the free trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers unless they cancel their subscription all paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance 

  

we stock more than 55000 dvd titles we have established revenue sharing relationships with several studios and distributors we also purchase titles directly from studios distributors and independent producers 

  

we ship and receive dvds throughout the united states we maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allow us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers 

  

we are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements 

  

we are organized in a single operating segment all our revenues are generated in the united states and we have no longlived assets outside the united states substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees 

  

industry overview 

  

filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels outofhome channels include movie theaters airlines and hotels inhome distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets cable and satellite television payperview videoondemand or vod and broadcast television currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market seven to nine months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks however in what continues to be an emerging trend the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window we anticipate that the studios will continue to test a variety of modifications or adjustments to the traditional window including releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod but we believe that dvd and its high definition successors hddvd and bluray will continue to receive a preferential distribution window in light of the large profits dvd generates for the studios 

  

challenges faced by consumers in selecting inhome filmed entertainment 

  

the proliferation of new releases available for inhome filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalogue titles on dvd create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles 

  

first despite the large number of available titles consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets subscription channels such as hbo and showtime and payperview services continue to offer a narrow selection of titles at specified times due to programming schedule constraints and technological issues relating to channel capacity traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalogue titles we believe our selection of over 55000 titles offers an attractive alternative to these traditional channels 

  

second even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service and our website features provide our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences 

  

competitive strengths 

  

we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths 

  

   

   

   

   

growth strategy 

  

our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements 

  

   

   

   

our web site—wwwnetflixcom 

  

we have applied substantial resources to plan develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our web site such as subscription account signup and management personalized movie merchandising inventory optimization and customer support we also launched new features such as our social networking feature called friends sm and our queue management feature called profiles sm  our software is written in a variety of languages and runs on industry standard platforms 

  

our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database this technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber 

  

we believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber 

  

our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers we use a realtime postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to promote speedy and accurate delivery subscribers pay for our service primarily by a credit or debit card we utilize third party services to authorize and process our payment methods 

  

throughout our web site we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities allowing us to continuously optimize our web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers we use random control testing extensively including testing service levels plans promotions and pricing 

  

our web site is run on hardware and software colocated at a service provider offering reliable network connections power air conditioning and other essential infrastructure we manage our web site 24 hours a day seven days a week we utilize a variety of proprietary software and freely available and commercially supported tools integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnose and recover from failures we conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers 

  

the terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at wwwnetflixcomtermsofuse 

  

merchandizing 

  

the key to our merchandizing efforts is the personal recommendations generated by our recommendation service all subscribers and site visitors are given many opportunities to rate titles and we have collected 

  

approximately one billion ratings the ratings from our recommendation service determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order in doing so we help our subscribers quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy ratings also determine which available titles are featured most prominently on our web site to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity finally data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our “recommendations” link to find other titles they may enjoy this has proven to be a powerful method for catalogue browsing and expanding library utilization 

  

we also provide our subscribers with detailed information about each title in our library which helps them select movies they will enjoy this information may include 

  

   

   

   

marketing 

  

we have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service online advertising is an important channel for acquiring new subscribers we advertise our service online through paid search listings banner ads text on popular web portals and other web sites and permission based emails in addition we have an affiliate program whereby we make available webbased banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a selfassisted basis from our web site and place on their web sites we also advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations we utilize direct mail and print advertising as well as promote our services in certain consumer package goods we also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studio’s movies in netflix promotional advertising we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of wordofmouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs 

  

content acquisition 

  

we acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time after the revenue sharing period expires for a title we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio destroying the title or purchasing the title the principal structure of each agreement is similar in nature but the specific terms are generally unique to each studio in addition to revenue sharing agreements we also purchase titles from various studios distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis 

  

fulfillment operations 

  

we currently stock more than 55000 titles on more than 25 million dvds we have allocated substantial resources to developing maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our web site transaction processing systems fulfillment operations inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers 

  

we ship and receive dvds from a nationwide network of shipping centers located throughout the united states we believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for subscribers by 

  

shortening the transit time for our dvds through the us postal service we currently do not ship on weekends or holidays 

  

customer service 

  

we believe that our ability to establish and maintain longterm relationships with subscribers depends in part on the strength of our customer support and service operations we encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our subscribers in order to continually improve our web site and our service our customer service center is open seven days a week we utilize email to correspond with subscribers we also offer phone support for subscribers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative we focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and automating certain selfservice features on our web site such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems our customer service center is located in our sunnyvale california facility 

  

competition 

  

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month 

  

video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include blockbuster movie gallery amazoncom walmart stores and best buy in particular in 2004 blockbuster launched on a nationwide basis its storebased subscription program this program provides many of the benefits of our business model in a storebased retail environment in addition blockbuster’s elimination of its traditional late fee policy has been adopted by all of its companyowned stores and many of its franchised stores we believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection convenience and price we believe that our scalable business model our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 55000 titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets 

  

we also compete against other online dvd subscription services such as blockbuster online subscription entertainment services such as hbo and showtime payperview and vod providers and cable and satellite providers it remains possible that other potential online entrants will offer competing services either directly or in conjunction with others or that blockbuster online will gain more traction in its current business 

  

we believe we are able to provide greater subscriber satisfaction due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental the broad and deep selection of titles we offer subscribers our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences the unique features we offer subscribers such as friends sm and profiles sm as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select receive and return titles we continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business 

  

vod and downloading of movies over the internet continues to receive considerable media attention in particular the recent launch of apple’s video ipod and announcements from companies ranging from google and yahoo to microsoft and intel regarding their efforts in digital delivery of content fuels public interest in the future of video entertainment delivery progress in digital delivery although slow and scattered continues to be made vod for example is now widely available to digital cable subscribers in major metropolitan areas such as new york boston los angeles and san francisco downloading of movies over the internet to a personal computer is currently available from providers such as movielink and cinemanow we anticipate that new devices and services for delivery of content will proliferate over the coming years but believe that dvd and its 

  

high definition successors hddvd and bluray will continue to dominate the home entertainment experience in the near term at some point in the future digital delivery directly to the home will surpass dvd and we believe that our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for dvd rentals and our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences positions us favorably to provide digital distribution of filmed entertainment as that market develops 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had 985 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments as of december 31 2005 we had 445 temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

  

intellectual property 

  

we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we have filed patents in the us and abroad in the us we were issued a broad business method patent covering among other things our subscription rental service in 2003 and we were issued a patent covering our mailing and response envelope in 2005 while our patents are an important element of our business our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one or a combination of patents we have a registered service mark for the netflix name and have filed applications for additional trademarks and service marks our software the content of our web site and other material which we create is protected by copyright we also protect certain details about our business methods processes and strategies as trade secrets and keep confidential information that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 

  

our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming to date we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and knowhow to protect our intellectual property it is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage 

  

from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute

if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

  

risks related to our business 

  

if our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful our revenues will be affected adversely 

  

we must continue to attract new subscribers to succeed we must continue to attract a large number of subscribers who have traditionally used video retailers video rental outlets cable channels such as hbo and showtime payperview and vod for inhome filmed entertainment in addition we face direct competition to our service namely from services like blockbuster online that will likely impact our ability to attract subscribers our ability to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers with a valuable and quality experience for selecting viewing receiving and returning titles including providing accurate recommendations through our recommendation service furthermore if our competitors are able to offer similar service levels at lower prices our ability to attract subscribers will be affected adversely if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract subscribers in addition many of our new subscribers originate from wordofmouth advertising and referrals from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract new subscribers and as a result our revenues will be affected adversely 

  

if we experience excessive rates of churn our revenues and business will be harmed 

  

we must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently delivery takes too long the service is a poor value competitive services provide a better value andor experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be affected adversely 

  

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change new technologies for delivery of inhome filmed entertainment such as vod and downloading over the internet continue to receive considerable media attention many of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do the rapid growth of our online entertainment subscription business since our inception may continue to attract direct competition from larger companies with significantly greater financial resources and national brand recognition for example we have seen the entry of direct competition from blockbuster which launched its online service in august 2004 and could face competition from potential new entrants into the online dvd rental market if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

in addition many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart and subscribe to netflix or some 

  

combination thereof all in the same month new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost dvds represent only one of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing filmed entertainment in addition the growth in adoption of dvd technology is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors and technologies we may not be able to achieve adequate market share increase our revenues or maintain profitability our principal competitors include or could include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and web site and systems development than we do there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current or new competitors at our existing pricing levels or at even lower price points in the future furthermore we may need to adjust the level of service provided to our subscribers andor incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate as a result of increased competition we have seen and may continue to see a reduction in operating margins and market share 

  

if vod or other technologies are widely adopted and supported as a method of content delivery by the studios and consumers our business could be adversely affected 

  

some digital cable providers and internet content providers have implemented technology referred to as vod this technology transmits movies and other entertainment content on demand with interactive capabilities such as start stop and rewind highspeed internet access has greatly increased the speed and quality of viewing vod content including featurelength movies on personal computers over the internet in addition other technologies have been developed that allow alternative means for consumers to receive and watch movies or other entertainment such as on cell phones or other handheld devices such as apple’s ipod if vod or other technologies become affordable and viable alternative methods of content delivery widely supported by studios and adopted by consumers our business could be adversely affected 

  

if the popularity of the dvd format decreases our business could be adversely affected 

  

consumers have rapidly adopted the dvd format for viewing inhome filmed entertainment over the past several years dvd sales have grown and now surpassed the vhs format in addition dvd sales account for more than 42 of studio revenues we believe that the dvd format including any successor formats such as hddvd and bluray will be valuable longterm consumer propositions and studio profit centers however if dvd sales were to decrease whether because of a shift away from movie watching or because new or existing technologies were to become more popular at the expense of dvd enjoyment studios and retailers may reduce their support of the dvd format our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by future popularity of the dvd format and if such popularity wanes our subscriber growth may also slow 

  

we depend on studios to release titles on dvd for an exclusive time period following theatrical release 

  

our ability to attract and retain subscribers is related to our ability to offer new releases of filmed entertainment on dvds prior to their release to other distribution channels except for theatrical release dvds currently enjoy a significant competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early distribution window for dvds the window for dvd rental and retail sales is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview premium television basic cable and network and syndicated television the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies our business could suffer increased competition if 

  

   

   

the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the title and we cannot assure you that the studios will not change their policies in the future in a manner that would be adverse to our business and results of operations currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market seven to nine months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks however in what continues to be an emerging trend the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window in addition some studios have discussed eliminating the release window on certain titles in particular releasing movies simultaneously on dvd and vod 

  

if we are unable to offset increased demand for titles with increased subscriber retention or operating margins our operating results may be affected adversely 

  

with our unlimited plans there is no established limit to the number of movies that subscribers may rent historically on a planbyplan basis we have seen the average number of movies rented per subscriber increase on an annual basis we believe that this increase in usage is influenced by improvements to our service as well as consumer usage habits in addition demand for titles may increase for a variety of reasons beyond our control including promotion by studios and seasonal variations or shifts in consumer movie watching 

  

we are continually adjusting our service in ways that may impact subscriber movie usage such adjustments include new web site features and merchandising practices an expanded distribution network as well as software and process changes 

  

our subscribers may continue to increase their usage of our service which would increase our operating costs if our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of increased operating costs our operating results will be adversely affected in addition our subscriber growth and retention may be affected adversely if we attempt to alter our service or increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles 

  

if our subscribers select titles or formats that are more expensive for us to acquire and deliver more frequently our expenses will increase 

  

certain titles cost us more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they are acquired and the terms on which they are acquired if subscribers select these titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected our revenue sharing and other dvd acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected in addition films released on the new high definition dvd formats hddvd and bluray may be more expensive to acquire the rate of customer acceptance and adoption of these new formats is uncertain if subscribers select these formats on a 

  

proportional basis more often than the existing dvd format our dvd acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected 

  

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results will be affected adversely 

  

the netflix brand is still developing and we must continue to build strong brand identity to succeed we must continue to attract and retain a large number of owners of dvd players who have traditionally relied on storebased rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service through our web site in addition we will have to compete for subscribers against other brands which have greater recognition than ours such as blockbuster we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will only increase in light of competition both for online subscription services and other means of distributing titles such as vod from timetotime our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among other things our inventory allocation and delivery processing to the extent such dissatisfaction is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers will be affected adversely 

  

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our marketing expenses may increase 

  

we utilize a broad mix of marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain a large portion of our new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including third party banner ads popunder placements direct links and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including television and radio advertising direct mail and print campaigns consumer package and mailing insertions we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership we maintain an active public relations program to increase awareness of our service and drive subscriber acquisition we opportunistically adjust our mix of marketing programs to acquire new subscribers at a reasonable cost with the intention of achieving overall financial goals if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our marketing expenses may increase 

  

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us become cost prohibitive or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide to enter our business or a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such channels in addition if ad rates increase we may curtail marketing expenses or otherwise be required to increase our cost per subscriber laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of email and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be affected adversely 

  

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 we anticipate further expanding our operations to help grow our subscriber base and to take advantage of favorable market opportunities any future expansion will likely place significant demands on our managerial operational administrative and financial resources if we are not able to respond effectively to new or increased demands that arise because of 

  

our growth or if in responding our management is materially distracted from our current operations our business may be affected adversely in addition if we do not have sufficient breadth and depth of the titles necessary to satisfy increased demand arising from growth in our subscriber base our subscriber satisfaction may be affected adversely 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

  

we use complex proprietary software to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations our proprietary technology is intended to allow our nationwide network of shipping centers to be operated on an integrated basis we continually enhance or modify the software used for our distribution operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers future enhancements and modifications to our proprietary technology could consume considerable resources if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of dvds among our shipping centers in a timely and efficient manner our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired 

  

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather natural disasters labor activism health epidemics or bioterrorism our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

  

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit and marketing expenses 

  

increases in postage delivery rates will adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase the us postal service recently increased the rate for first class postage on january 8 2006 by 2 cents from 37 cents to 39 cents in addition the us congress has been considering postal reform legislation which would provide the us postal service with more flexibility in establishing postal rates the us postal service continues to focus on plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs or higher breakage for our dvds and our gross margin could be affected adversely also if the us postal service curtails its services such as by closing facilities or discontinuing or reducing saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be affected adversely 

  

currently most filmed entertainment is packaged on a single lightweight dvd our delivery process is designed to accommodate the delivery of one dvd to fulfill a selection because of the lightweight nature of a dvd we generally mail one envelope containing a title using standard us postage studios occasionally provide additional content on a second dvd or may package a title on two dvds in addition the studios have recently announced plans to release certain films in high definition format on hddvds and bluray dvds these new dvds have characteristics that are different than those currently in circulation these highdefinition format dvds may be heavier andor more fragile than current dvds if packaging of filmed entertainment on 

  

multiple dvds were to become more prevalent if the weight of dvds were to increase or the durability of dvds deteriorate our costs of delivery and fulfillment processing would increase and our costs of replacing damaged dvds may rise materially which would depress gross margins and profitability and adversely affect free cash flow 

  

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation service our business may suffer 

  

based on proprietary algorithms our recommendation service enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandize our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation service to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure you that the proprietary algorithms in our recommendation service will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

  

we are continually refining our recommendation service in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing such refinements in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation service 

  

if our recommendation service does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

  

   

   

   

if we do not correctly anticipate our short and longterm needs for titles our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be affected adversely 

  

if we do not acquire sufficient copies of titles we may not satisfy subscriber demand and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be affected adversely conversely if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be affected adversely 

  

if we are unable to renew or renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us or if the cost of purchasing titles on a wholesale basis increases our gross margins may be affected adversely 

  

since 2000 we have entered into numerous revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors these revenue sharing agreements generally have terms of up to five years revenue share agreements typically enable us to increase our copy depth of dvds on an economical basis because of the low initial payment additional payments are made only if our subscribers rent the dvd under a purchase arrangement we must pay the full wholesale price regardless of whether the dvd is rented in addition revenue sharing agreements generally provide for studio promotional support of the associated dvd and our service as well as permit us to own the dvd following expiration of the revenue sharing period typically no more than 12 months following street date 

  

during the course of our revenue sharing relationship with studios and distributors various contract administration issues arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors may be adversely impacted 

  

as our revenue sharing agreements expire we may be required to negotiate new terms that could be disadvantageous to us or if we cannot renew the agreements we would be required to purchase titles in such event the cost of acquiring content could increase and our gross margins may be affected adversely in addition if we were required to purchase titles the risk associated with accurately predicting title demand could increase 

  

titles that we do not acquire under a revenue sharing agreement are purchased on a wholesale basis from studios or other distributors if the price of purchased titles increases our gross margin will be affected adversely 

  

if the sales price of dvds to retail consumers decreases our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

the cost of manufacturing dvds is substantially less than the price for which new dvds are generally sold in the retail market thus we believe that studios and other resellers of dvds have significant flexibility in pricing dvds for retail sale if the retail price of dvds decreases significantly consumers may choose to purchase dvds instead of subscribing to our service 

  

we may need additional capital and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available 

  

historically we have funded our operations and capital expenditures through proceeds from private equity and debt financings equipment leases and cash flow from operations although we currently anticipate that the proceeds from our may 2002 initial public offering together with our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

  

any significant disruption in service on our web site or in our computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers 

  

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site where the title selection process is integrated with our delivery processing systems and software our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our web site network infrastructure and fulfillment processes interruptions in these systems could make our web site unavailable and hinder our ability to fulfill selections much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems service interruptions or the unavailability of our web site could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

  

our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our web site service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our web site or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our communications hardware and the computer hardware used to operate our web site are hosted at the facilities of a third party provider hardware for our delivery systems is maintained in our shipping centers fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these 

  

systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business problems faced by our third party web hosting provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its customers including us could impact adversely the experience of our subscribers 

  

our executive offices and our sunnyvalebased shipping center are located in the san francisco bay area in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations would be affected adversely 

  

our executive offices and our sunnyvalebased shipping center which also houses our customer service operations are located in the san francisco bay area our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of electrical blackouts fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations due to disruptions in service in the san francisco bay area or any other facility because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our sunnyvalebased operations center and the surrounding transportation infrastructure we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes 

  

the loss of our chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief marketing officer or our failure to attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business and new service developments 

  

we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board w barry mccarthy jr our chief financial officer and leslie j kilgore our chief marketing officer in addition much of our key technology and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 

  

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data 

  

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendation service we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

  

to secure transmission of confidential information obtained by us for billing purposes including subscribers’ credit card or checking account data we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology in conjunction with the payment processing companies we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data if despite these measures we experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers and our business could be affected adversely similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

  

in addition because we obtain subscribers’ billing information on our web site we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the 

  

extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

  

increases in payment processing fees would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards and debit cards and to a lesser extent electronic checks our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result in a change in our business practices which increase the fees on a costpertransaction basis these fees may increase in 2006 such increase may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

  

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights netflix is a registered trademark of netflix inc in the united states and united kingdom we have also filed trademark applications in the united states for the friends and profiles service marks and for the netflix design logo and have filed us patent applications for certain aspects of our technology we have also filed a trademark application in the european union for the netflix name from time to time we expect to file additional trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

  

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site our recommendation service title selection processes and marketing activities 

  

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights or develop noninfringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be affected adversely many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and 

  

management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site or our recommendation service or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandizing or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

  

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be affected adversely

forecasting film revenue and associated gross profits from our films prior to release is extremely difficult and may result in significant writeoffs 

  

we are required to amortize capitalized film production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from the associated films the amount of film production costs that will be amortized each period depends on how much future revenue we expect to receive from each film unamortized film production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a filmbyfilm basis if estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized film production costs the unamortized film production costs will be written down to fair value in any given period if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film we would be required to accelerate amortization of related film costs such accelerated amortization would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition in addition we base our estimates of revenue on performance of comparable titles and our knowledge of the industry if the information is incorrect the amount of revenue and related expenses that we recognize from our films could be wrong which could result in fluctuations in our earnings

recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs 

  

changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and recentlyenacted rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission have increased and may continue to increase our expenses as we evaluate the implications of these rules and devote resources to respond to their requirements 

  

the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is listed has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which would adversely affect our business 

  

risks related to our stock ownership 

  

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over netflix 

  

as of december 31 2005 our executive officers and directors their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 31 percent of our outstanding common stock warrants and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days in particular jay hoag one of our directors beneficially owned approximately 21 percent and reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board beneficially owned approximately 10 percent these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from yours and will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

  

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

  

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our executive severance and retention incentive plan thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 percent or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

  

our stock price is volatile 

  

the price at which our common stock has traded since our may 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

  

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

  

we record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

  

during the second quarter of 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation ” “sfas 123” for stock based employee compensation in addition during the third quarter of 2003 we began granting stock options to 

  

our employees on a monthly basis the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately in comparison with the three to fouryear vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expenses determined under sfas no 123 are fully recognized in the same periods as the monthly stock option grants in addition we continue to amortize the deferred compensation of stock options with three to fouryear vesting periods granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 over the remaining vesting periods our stockbased compensation expenses totaled 107 million 166 million and 143 million during 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively we expect our stockbased compensation expenses will continue to be significant in future periods which will have an adverse impact on our operating results the blackscholes optionpricing model used by us requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

  

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our performance may differ materially from actual results 

  

given the dynamic nature of our business and the inherent limitations in predicting the future forecasts of our revenues gross margin operating expenses number of paying subscribers number of dvds shipped per day and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

overview 

  

our business 

  

we are the largest online movie rental subscription service providing more than 4200000 subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than 55000 movie television and other filmed entertainment titles our most popular subscription plan allows subscribers to have up to three titles out at the same time with no due dates late fees or shipping charges for 1799 per month in addition we offer a number of other subscription plans to accommodate a variety of movie watching preferences subscribers select titles at our web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service receive them on dvd by us mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers after a title has been returned we mail the next available title in a subscriber’s queue the terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at wwwnetflixcomtermsofuse 

  

we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees our business has grown rapidly since inception resulting in substantially increased revenues our growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of dvds as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online dvd rentals we expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online dvd rentals continues to grow a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model 

  

we continued to see strong growth and financial results in 2005 with revenues achieving doubledigit growth from a year ago this growth can be attributed to an expanding subscriber base we added approximately 16 million net new subscribers in 2005 growing from 26 million to 42 million subscribers at december 31 2005 our operating income was lower in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily as a result of having lowered the subscription price of our most popular service plan in the fourth quarter of 2004 while increasing marketing spending in a competitive environment 

  

recent developments and initiatives 

  

we continue to face direct competition from blockbuster it remains possible that other potential entrants will offer competing services either directly or in conjunction with others or that blockbuster will gain more traction in its current business we continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business 

  

we launched two new revenue initiatives in 2005 retail sales of previouslyviewed dvds and our ad sales program we also continue to invest resources to develop solutions for downloading movies to consumers our core strategy has been and remains to grow a large dvd subscription business however as technology and infrastructure develop to allow effective and convenient delivery of movies over the internet and when meaningful content becomes available we intend to offer our subscribers the choice of receiving their movies on dvd or by downloading whichever they prefer 

  

key business metrics 

  

management periodically reviews certain key business metrics within the context of our articulated performance goals in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business the key business metrics include the following 

  

   

   

   

management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the securities and exchange commission has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

amortization of dvd library and upfront costs 

  

we acquire dvds from studios and distributors through either direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements we acquire dvds for the purpose of renting them to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such we consider our dvd library to be a productive asset and classify our dvd library as a noncurrent asset additionally in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards 95 “ statement of cash flows ” “sfas 95” we classify cash outflows for the acquisition of the dvd library including any upfront nonrefundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

we amortize our dvd library less estimated salvage value on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over its estimated useful life the useful life of the newrelease dvds and backcatalogue dvds is estimated to be 1 year and 3 years respectively in estimating the useful life of our dvd library we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds volume purchase discounts received from studios on the purchase of titles are recorded as a reduction of dvd library inventory when earned 

  

prior to july 1 2004 we amortized the cost of our entire dvd library including the capitalized portion of the initial fixed license fee on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over one year however based on our periodic evaluation of both new release and backcatalogue utilization for amortization purposes we determined that backcatalogue titles have a significantly longer life than previously estimated as a result we revised our estimate of useful life for the backcatalogue dvd library from a “sum of the months” accelerated method using a oneyear life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a threeyear life the purpose of this change is to more accurately reflect the productive life of these assets in accordance with apb 20 the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis from july 1 2004 new releases will continue to be amortized over a oneyear period we believe the use of the accelerated method is appropriate for the amortization of our dvd library and the initial fixed license fee because it approximates dvd utilization 

  

in the third quarter of 2004 we determined that we were selling fewer previously rented dvds than estimated but at an average selling price higher than historically estimated we therefore revised our estimate of salvage values on direct purchase dvds for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives a salvage value of 300 per dvd has been provided effective july 1 2004 for those dvds that we do not expect to sell no salvage value is provided 

  

the revenue sharing agreements enable us to obtain dvds at a lower upfront cost than under traditional direct purchase arrangements under the revenue sharing agreements we share a percentage of the actual net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with the studios over a fixed period of time or the title term which is typically 12 months for each dvd title at the end of the title term we generally have the option of returning the dvd title to the studio destroying the title or purchasing the title in addition we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our dvd library amortization policy in some cases this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred 

  

we will continue to periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvd library 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we account for stockbased compensation expenses in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 we use the blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted in light of the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” we reevaluated the assumptions used to estimate the value of stock options beginning in the second quarter of 2005 

  

   

   

   

income taxes 

  

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

  

as of december 31 2004 our deferred tax assets primarily the tax benefits of loss carryforwards were offset in full by a valuation allowance because of our history of losses through the first quarter of 2003 limited profitable quarters to date and the competitive landscape of online dvd rentals as a result of our analysis of expected future income at december 31 2005 it was considered more likely than not that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was no longer required resulting in the release of a previously recorded allowance generating a 349 million tax benefit deferred tax assets do not include the tax benefits attributable to approximately 65 million of excess tax deductions related to stock options these benefits will only be recorded when realized on tax returns and will be credited to equity at that time 

  

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination

amortization of dvd library on july 1 2004 we revised the estimate of useful life for the backcatalogue dvd library from one to three years new releases will continue to be amortized over a oneyear period we also revised our estimate of salvage values on direct purchase dvds for those direct purchase dvds that we expect to sell at the end of their useful lives a salvage value of 300 per dvd has been provided effective july 1 2004 for those dvds that we do not expect to sell no salvage value is provided

stockbased compensation during the second quarter of 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 for stockbased compensation we elected to apply the retroactive restatement method under sfas no 148 and all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the compensation costs that would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 been applied to all awards granted 

  

during the third quarter of 2003 we began granting stock options to our employees on a monthly basis the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately in comparison with the three to fouryear vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 as a result of immediate vesting all stockbased compensation expense determined under sfas no 123 is fully recognized upon the grant of the stock option for those stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 with three to fouryear vesting periods we continue to amortize the deferred compensation related to those stock options over the remaining vesting periods

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods presented the line items in our statements of income as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k 

  

   

revenues 

   

we currently generate all of our revenues in the united states we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscriber’s monthly subscription period in addition in 2005 we generated a small portion of our revenues from the sale of advertising 

  

the increase in our revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers as summarized in the table above offset in part by a decline in average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber we believe the increase in the number of paying subscribers was driven primarily by increased consumer awareness of the benefits of online dvd rentals and 

  

continuing improvements in our service the decline in the average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber was a result of the price decrease of our most popular subscription plan coupled with the increased promotion of our lower cost subscription plans in june 2004 we increased the monthly subscription price of our most popular subscription plan from 1995 to 2199 however effective november 2004 we lowered the price of the most popular subscription plan to 1799 in addition we introduced new lower priced subscription plans in the second quarter of 2005 we expect the average revenue per paying subscriber to continue to decline as we promote our lower priced subscription plans 

  

the increase in our revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily as a result of substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers and to a lesser extent due to a slight increase in average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber we believe the increase in the number of paying subscribers was driven by the continuing consumer adoption of dvd players increased consumer awareness of our service and continuing improvements in our service the increase in the average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber was a result of the price increases discussed above 

  

churn declined to 40 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 44 percent in the same period of 2004 and from 48 percent in the same period of 2003 we believe the decline was primarily due to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

if we are unable to compete effectively against blockbuster and our other existing competitors as well as against potential new entrants into the online movie rental subscription business in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our churn will likely increase and our business will be adversely affected 

  

the following table presents our ending subscriber information

the increase in cost of subscription for 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

the increase in cost of subscription in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

fulfillment expenses 

  

the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to an increase in credit card fees as a result of the increase in subscriptions an increase in personnel 

  

related costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers and an increase in facilityrelated costs resulting from expansion of certain of our shipping centers and the addition of new ones 

  

the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers coupled with an increase in credit card fees as a result of the increase in subscriptions in addition the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facilityrelated costs resulting from the relocation or expansion of certain of our shipping centers and the addition of new ones 

  

gross margin 

  

   

in 2005 in light of discussions with the securities and exchange commission “sec” we reclassified fulfillment expenses in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of revenues in prior periods we had reported fulfillment expenses as a component of operating expenses accordingly cost of revenues gross profit and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income for 2003 and 2004 have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

the decline in gross margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to the increase in cost of subscription offset in part by a decrease in fulfillment expenses as a percentage of revenue cost of subscription increased due to a decline in revenue per paid shipment as a result of the price decrease of our most popular service plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2004 offset partially by the change in estimate related to the useful life of our backcatalogue dvd library and the rapid growth of lower priced plans which produce a higher margin than our most popular subscription plan of 1799 per month in addition the gross margin for 2004 was favorably impacted by certain credits received from studios resulting from amendments to revenue sharing agreements 

  

if movie rentals per average paying subscriber increases or if we see more shipments of dvds subject to revenue share additional erosion in our gross margin will occur additionally the increase in postage rates effective january 8 2006 may adversely impact our gross margin 

  

gross margin increased slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 this increase was primarily attributable to a decline in fulfillment expenses as a percentage of revenues 

  

operating expenses 

  

technology and development 

  

   

the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars for 2005 as compared 2004 was primarily the result of an increase in personnelrelated and systems infrastructure costs as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses remained constant in 2005 as compared to 2004 

  

the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily the result of an increase in personnelrelated costs as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses decreased primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than technology and development expenses 

  

we continuously research and test a variety of potential improvements to our internal hardware and software systems in an effort to improve our productivity and enhance our subscribers’ experience additionally we are developing solutions for downloading movies to subscribers as a result we expect our technology and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in 2006 

  

marketing 

  

   

the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing program costs primarily direct mail radio television and online advertising to attract new subscribers as a percentage of revenues the increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in marketing expenses than revenues subscriber acquisition cost increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to an increase in overall marketing program spending and spending on a per acquired subscriber basis offset partially by a decrease in the cost of providing free trials associated with our new lower priced plans and by a 21 million reduction in liability due to the final settlement of certain marketing programs 

  

the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing program costs primarily television and online advertising to attract new subscribers in addition personnelrelated costs increased in order to support the higher volume of marketing activities as a percentage of revenues the increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in marketing expenses than revenues subscriber acquisition cost increased in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of an increase in marketing program spending primarily the introduction of television advertising as an acquisition channel and increases in online advertising rates 

  

the competitive landscape including the continued offering by blockbuster of its online service the potential entry of others into the online subscription rental business could adversely impact our marketing expenditures as we seek to maintain and increase our market leadership we anticipate that our marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in 2006 as we grow our business 

  

general and administrative 

  

   

the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to an increase in legal costs as well as an increase in personnelrelated costs insurance costs and professional fees to support our growing operations general and administrative costs in 2005 included an accrual of 81 million net of expected insurance proceeds for reimbursement of legal defense costs of 09 million related to the proposed settlement costs of the chavez vs netflix inc lawsuit as a percentage of revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in general and administrative expenses than increase in revenues 

  

the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs as well as an increase in professional fees to support our growing operations and compliance requirements as a percentage of revenues the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than general and administrative expenses 

  

we expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in 2006 in order to support our growing operations 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

   

we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 for stockbased employee compensation in the second quarter of 2003 we elected to apply the retroactive restatement method under sfas no 148 and all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the compensation costs that would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 been applied to all awards granted to employees 

  

we began granting fully vested stock options to our employees on a monthly basis beginning in the third quarter of 2003 stockbased compensation expenses associated with these stock options are recognized immediately for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 with three to fouryear vesting periods we continue to amortize the deferred compensation associated with these stock options over their remaining vesting periods 

  

we apply the blackscholes optionpricing model to value our stock option grants the blackscholes optionpricing model used by us requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

  

the decrease in stockbased compensation expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in the expected volatility assumption used to estimate 

  

the fair value of the stock options granted beginning in the second quarter of 2005 however the impact of this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the expected life assumption used to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted beginning in the second quarter of 2005 and higher expense resulting from larger grants and higher average grant prices 

  

the increase in stockbased compensation expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher expenses resulting from larger grants higher average grant prices and higher volatility assumptions in 2004 as compared to 2003 

  

gain on disposal of dvds 

  

   

in prior periods proceeds from sales of previously viewed dvds and the related cost of dvds sold were reported as sales revenues and cost of sales revenues respectively on our consolidated statements of income in 2005 in light of discussions with the sec and consistent with the guidance in sfas 95 and sfas 144 we began to report the net gain on sales of dvds as a separate line item within operating expenses accordingly sales revenues and cost of sales revenues in the consolidated statements of income for 2003 and 2004 were reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

the decrease in gain on disposal of dvds in absolute dollars in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to an increase in the cost of dvd sales 

  

the increase in gain on disposal of dvds in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of dvds sold offset in part by an increase in cost of dvd sales 

  

interest and other income 

   

the increase in interest and other income in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents due to increased interest rates as well as higher average cash balances 

  

the increase in interest and other income in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase in interest and other income as a result of higher average interest earning balances 

  

provision for benefit from income taxes 

  

   

in 2005 we recorded an income tax benefit of 337 million on pretax income of 83 million our 2005 income tax benefit includes a tax benefit for the reduction in the valuation allowance of 349 million we continuously monitor the circumstances impacting the expected realization of our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005 we reduced the valuation allowance after determining that substantially all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realizable due to expected future income in 2004 we recorded an income tax provision of 02 million on a pretax income of 218 million our effective tax rates for all years differ from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the valuation allowance in all years 

  

we currently anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 41 in 2006 the effective rate will be impacted favorably or unfavorably by the effect of book and tax stock option expenses in 2006 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

since inception we have financed our activities primarily through a series of private placements of convertible preferred stock subordinated promissory notes our initial public offering and net cash generated from operating activities as of december 31 2005 we had cash and cash equivalents of 2123 million we have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001 many factors will impact our ability to continue to generate and grow cash from our operations including but not limited to the number of subscribers who sign up for our service the growth or reduction in our subscriber base and our ability to develop new revenue sources in addition we may have to or otherwise choose to lower our prices and increase our marketing expenses in order to grow faster or respond to competition although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with our available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

  

key components of cash flow 

  

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities 

  

   

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by 154 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase in operating cash was primarily attributable to the increase in net income the increase in amortization of dvd library as a result of increased purchases of titles increase in depreciation of property and equipment increase in deferred revenue due to a larger subscriber base and increase in gift subscriptions and increases in accrued expenses as a result of our growing operations net cash provided by operating activities increased by 578 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income adjusted for an increase in amortization of our dvd library as a result of increased purchases of titles an increase in stockbased compensation expense and an increase in deferred revenue due to a larger subscriber base 

  

investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by 703 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase was primarily because cash used in investing activities in 2004 included net proceeds of 

  

450 million from the sale of our shortterm investments excluding the impact of the net proceeds from the sale of our shortterm investments cash used in investing activities increased by 253 million primarily due to increased purchases of titles for our dvd library to support our larger subscriber base and increased purchases of property and equipment to support our growing operations in 2005 as compared to 2004 

  

net cash used in investing activities increased slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to increased purchases of titles for our dvd library to support our larger subscriber base and increased purchases of property and equipment to support our growing operations in 2004 as compared to 2003 however the increase was partially offset by net proceeds of 450 million from the sale of our shortterm investments 

  

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by 77 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 

  

net cash provided by financing activities increased slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in the repayment of debt and other obligations offset partially by lower proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2005 in thousands 

  

    

   

for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31 2005 timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities accordingly our operating results financial condition and cash flows are not subject to offbalance sheet risks 

  

indemnifications 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 

  

the terms of such obligations vary generally a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated so the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated to date we have not incurred material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r sharebased payment  which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services this standard replaces sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no 25 in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin 107 sab 107 which summarizes the views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the staff’s views regarding the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements for public companies in april 2005 the sec issued release 338568 delaying the effective date of sfas 123r and as such we will be required to implement the provisions of sfas no 123r beginning january 1 2006 we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 in the second quarter of 2003 and restated prior periods at that time accordingly we believe sfas no 123r will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in accordance with sab 107 effective january 1 2006 we will no longer present stockbased compensation separately on our statements of income instead we will present stockbased compensation in the same lines as cash compensation paid to the same individuals 

  

additionally sfas 123r requires that cash inflows from financing activities on our statement of cash flows include the cash retained as a result of the tax deductibility of increases in the value of equity instruments issued under sharebased payment arrangements in excess of any related stockbased compensation recognizable for financial reporting purposes these tax benefits shall be determined based on the individual award method this cash benefit has been included in the determination of cash provided by operating activities on our statement of cash flows in 2004 the change in methods will not likely have a significant negative effect on our cash provided by operating activities in periods after adoption of sfas 123r 

  

in march 2005 the fasb issued fin 47 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  fin 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a “conditional” asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated the provision is effective for no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas 154 replaces apb opinion no 20 accounting changes and sfas no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  sfas 154 requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied 

  

retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle sfas 154 also requires that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a longlived nonfinancial asset be accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 

  

in september 2005 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued eitf 0506 “ determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements after lease inception or acquired in a business combination ” eitf 0506 requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination be capitalized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition eitf 0506 also requires leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured as defined in paragraph 5 of statement 13 at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased eitf 0506 is effective for leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june 29 2005 early adoption of the consensus is permitted in periods for which financial statements have not been issued we do not expect the adoption of eitf 0506 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “ the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments ” which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired whether that impairment is otherthantemporary and on measuring such impairment loss fsp 1151 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthan temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments fsp 1151 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 although we will continue to evaluate the application of fsp 1151 and fsp 1241 we do not currently believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline to minimize this risk we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of securities our cash equivalents are generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

   

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures accordingly even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving their control objectives based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to the material weakness identified in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting below 

  

   

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework  

  

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 

  

management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 related to our accounting for income taxes specifically our policies and procedures do not include adequate management review of the calculations and related supporting documentation to ensure that its accounting for income taxes is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles this material weakness resulted in a material error in the company’s consolidated financial statements related to the understatement of deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheet and the understatement of the benefit from income taxes in the consolidated statement of income this error was corrected prior to the filing of our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k 

  

as a result of the material weakness described above management has concluded the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an auditors’ report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 which report appears on page f3 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

   

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2005 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are taking the following action to remediate the material weakness described above implementing additional review procedures to ensure complete supporting documentation is available to ensure compliance with generally accepted accounting principles this action will be in place in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the first quarter of 2006 

  

   

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within netflix have been detected

 item 1 business tableend   

we are the largest online movie rental subscription service providing more than 2600000 subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than 35000 movie television and other filmed entertainment titles our standard subscription plan allows subscribers to have up to three titles out at the same time with no due dates late fees or shipping charges for 1799 per month in addition to our standard plan we offer other service plans with different price points that allow subscribers to keep either fewer or more titles at the same time subscribers select titles at our web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service receive them on dvd by us mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers after a title has been returned we mail the next available title in a subscriber’s queue 

  

our subscription service has grown rapidly since its launch in september 1999 we believe our growth has been driven primarily by our comprehensive selection of titles consistently high levels of customer satisfaction rapid consumer adoption of dvd players and our effective marketing programs in the san francisco bay area approximately 9 percent and in the rest of the country approximately 23 of all households subscribed to netflix at the end of 2004 

  

our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandize our comprehensive library of titles we believe that our recommendation technology based on proprietary algorithms and the hundreds of millions of movie ratings we have collected from our subscribers enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization 

  

we continually invest in improvements to our service in an effort to deepen our subscriber relationships as well as to further distinguish our service from that of our competitors in the fourth quarter of 2004 we launched our social networking feature called friends tm  which allows subscribers to share movie ratings and recommendations with their friends who are also netflix subscribers we also launched profiles tm  which allows subscribers to set up subaccounts for spouses children and others where each subaccount gets its own queue and recommendations 

  

we promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs including online promotions television advertising package inserts and other promotions with third parties these programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and may include a free trial period of 14 days at the end of the free trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers unless they cancel their subscription all paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance 

  

index to financial statements we stock more than 35000 dvd titles we have established revenue sharing relationships with more than 67 studios and distributors we also purchase titles directly from studios distributors and independent producers 

  

we ship and receive dvds throughout the united states we maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allow us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers as of december 31 2004 we had 30 shipping centers 

  

we are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements 

  

we are organized in a single operating segment all our revenues are generated in the united states and we have no longlived assets outside the united states substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees 

  

industry overview 

  

filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels outofhome channels include movie theaters airlines and hotels inhome distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets cable and satellite television payperview videoondemand or vod and broadcast television currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately three to six months after theatrical release to the home video market seven to nine months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks however in what is an emerging trend the major studios have shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window 

  

consumer transition to dvd 

  

the home video segment of the inhome filmed entertainment market has undergone a rapid technology transition away from vhs to dvd according to adams media research at the end of 2004 there were approximately 71 million us television households with a standalone settop dvd player representing approximately 64 percent of us television households this number does not include other electronic devices such as computers and video game players many of which are also capable of playing dvds we provide titles to our subscribers on dvd only and have never carried vhs content 

  

challenges faced by consumers in selecting inhome filmed entertainment 

  

the proliferation of new releases available for inhome filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalogue titles on dvd create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles 

  

first despite the large number of available titles consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets subscription channels such as hbo and showtime and payperview services continue to offer a narrow selection of titles at specified times due to programming schedule constraints and technological issues relating to channel capacity traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalogue titles 

  

second even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service provides our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences 

  

index to financial statements competitive strengths 

  

we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths 

  

   

   

   

   

growth strategy 

  

our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements 

  

   

index to financial statements    

   

our web site—wwwnetflixcom 

  

we have applied substantial resources to plan develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our web site such as subscription account signup and management personalized movie merchandising inventory optimization and customer support we have also recently launched new features that enable social networking for our subscribers and further individualize the service through establishment of subaccounts our software is written in a variety of languages and runs on industry standard platforms 

  

our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database this technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber 

  

we believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber 

  

our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers we use a realtime postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to promote speedy and accurate delivery subscribers may pay for our service using a credit card debit card or electronic check we utilize third party services to authorize and process these payment methods 

  

throughout our web site we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities allowing us to continuously optimize our web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers we use random control testing extensively 

  

our web site is run on hardware and software colocated at a service provider offering reliable network connections power air conditioning and other essential infrastructure we manage our web site 24 hours a day seven days a week we utilize a variety of proprietary software freely available and commercially supported tools integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnose and recover from failures we conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers 

  

the terms and conditions by which subscribers utilize our service and a more detailed description of how our service works can be found at wwwnetflixcomtermsofuse 

  

index to financial statements merchandizing 

  

the key to our merchandizing efforts is the personal recommendations generated by our recommendation service all subscribers and site visitors are given many opportunities to rate titles and we have collected over 525 million ratings the ratings from our recommendation service determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order in doing so we help our subscribers quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy ratings also determine which available titles are featured most prominently on our web site to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity finally data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our “recommendations” link to find other titles they may enjoy this has proven to be a powerful method for catalogue browsing 

  

we also provide our subscribers with decision support information about each title in our library this information includes 

  

   

   

   

marketing 

  

we have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service online advertising is one important channel for acquiring new subscribers we advertise our service online through paid search listings banner ads text on popular web portals and other web sites and permission based emails in addition we have an affiliate program whereby we make available webbased banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a selfassisted basis from our web site and place on their web sites 

  

we pay for online marketing on a placement perimpression basis or perclick basis as well as through cash bounties paid for each subscriber referred to us we also participate in a variety of cooperative advertising programs with studios under the terms of which we receive cash consideration in exchange for featuring the studio’s movies in netflix promotional advertising we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of wordofmouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs 

  

we work with a number of other marketing channels for example we advertise our service on various regional and national television and radio stations we also have a number of arrangements where advertisements describing our service are inserted or otherwise incorporated into consumer packaging such as dvd player boxes we utilize direct mail and print we also have a relationship with a leading consumer electronics and video retailer which involves a variety of promotional efforts 

  

content acquisition 

  

we acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time after the revenue sharing period expires for a title we generally have the option of returning the title to the studio destroying the title or purchasing the title the principal terms of each agreement are similar in nature but are generally unique to each studio in addition to revenue sharing agreements we also purchase titles from various studios distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis 

  

index to financial statements fulfillment operations 

  

we currently stock more than 35000 titles on more than 24 million dvds we have allocated substantial resources to developing maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our web site transaction processing systems fulfillment operations inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers 

  

we ship and receive dvds from 30 shipping centers located throughout the united states we believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our dvds through the us postal service we currently do not ship on weekends or holidays 

  

customer service 

  

we believe that our ability to establish and maintain longterm relationships with subscribers depends in part on the strength of our customer support and service operations we encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our subscribers in order to continually improve our web site and our service our customer service center is open seven days a week we utilize email to proactively correspond with subscribers we also offer phone support for subscribers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative we focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and automating certain selfservice features on our web site such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems our customer service center is located in our sunnyvale california facility 

  

competition 

  

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month 

  

video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include blockbuster hollywood entertainment amazoncom walmart stores and best buy in particular in 2004 blockbuster launched on a nationwide basis its storebased subscription program this program provides many of the benefits of our business model in a storebased retail environment in addition in early 2005 blockbuster eliminated its traditional late fee policy we believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection convenience and price we believe that our scalable business model our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 35000 titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets 

  

we also compete against other online dvd subscription services such as blockbuster online and walmartcom subscription entertainment services such as hbo and showtime payperview and vod providers and cable and satellite providers the direct online competition has intensified significantly since blockbuster officially launched its online service in august 2004 in particular blockbuster has been aggressive in pricing its standard threeout service at a monthly charge of approximately twenty percent lower than ours we believe we are able to provide greater subscriber satisfaction due to our focused attention to the business of online subscription rental the broad and deep selection of titles we offer subscribers our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences the unique features we offer subscribers such as friends tm and profiles tm as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select receive and return titles 

  

index to financial statements vod and downloading of movies over the internet have received considerable media attention recently vod for example is now widely available in most major hotels and has early deployments in many major cable systems within a few years we believe vod will become widely available to digital cable and satellite subscribers vod carries as many titles as can be effectively merchandized on a settop box platform which we believe to be generally up to 100 recent releases plus adult content for consumers who primarily want the latest big releases vod may be a convenient distribution channel downloading of movies over the internet is currently available from a limited number of providers such as movielink and cinemanow and typically involves delivery of content to a personal computer we believe that our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base for dvd rentals and our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences positions us favorably to provide digital distribution of filmed entertainment as that market develops 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had 940 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments as of december 31 2004 we had 253 temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

  

intellectual property 

  

we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property in 2003 we were issued a broad business method patent covering among other things our subscription rental service the patent will expire in 2020 in addition to the patent covering the rental method invention we have filed additional patent applications we have a registered trademark for the netflix name and copyrights on the content of our web site we have filed applications for additional trademarks as well 

  

enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming to date we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and knowhow to protect our intellectual property it is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage 

  

from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we believe that our service offering does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party however we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute

index to financial statements    

   

   

please see “results of operations” below for further discussion on these key business metrics 

  

recent developments and initiatives 

  

we continue to experience aggressive direct competition from blockbuster in particular blockbuster cut its standard subscription price twice during the last quarter of 2004 and currently has a price 3 below our standard price in addition blockbuster has begun television advertising of its online offering we also anticipate that other entrants such as amazoncom will offer competing services either directly or in conjunction with others despite this dynamic competitive landscape we do not intend to lose our leadership position while we aim to maintain domestic market leadership in the face of aggressive competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

we continue to invest resources to develop solutions for downloading movies to consumers our core strategy has been and remains to grow a large dvd subscription business however as technology and infrastructure develop to allow effective and convenient delivery of movies over the internet we intend to offer our subscribers the choice under one subscription of receiving their movies on dvd or by downloading whichever they prefer although our solutions may be well in advance of meaningful demand for downloading services and we expect only modest consumer interest for the near term we believe the demand for this technology will grow steadily over the next ten years 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the securities and exchange commission has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are 

  

index to financial statements based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

amortization of dvd library and upfront costs 

  

we acquire dvds from studios and distributors through either direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements the revenue sharing agreements enable us to obtain dvds at a lower upfront cost than under traditional direct purchase arrangements under the revenue sharing agreements we share a percentage of the actual net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with the studios over a fixed period of time or the title term which is typically twelve months for each dvd title at the end of the title term we generally have the option of returning the dvd title to the studio destroying the title or purchasing the title 

  

in addition we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our dvd library amortization policy in some cases this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred we amortize our dvd library less estimated salvage value on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over its estimated useful life the useful life of the newrelease dvds and backcatalogue dvds is estimated to be 1 year and 3 years respectively in estimating the useful life of our dvd library we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds 

  

prior to july 1 2004 we amortized the cost of our entire dvd library including the capitalized portion of the initial fixed license fee on a “sumofthemonths” accelerated basis over one year however based on our periodic evaluation of both new release and backcatalogue utilization for amortization purposes we determined that backcatalogue titles have a significantly longer life than previously estimated as a result we have revised our estimate of useful life for the backcatalogue dvd library from a “sum of the months” accelerated method using a oneyear life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a threeyear life the purpose of this change is to more accurately reflect the productive life of these assets in accordance with apb 20 the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis from july 1 2004 new releases will continue to be amortized over a oneyear period as a result of the change in the estimated life of the backcatalogue library total cost of revenues was 109 million lower net income was 109 million higher and net income per diluted share was 017 higher for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

we believe the use of the accelerated method is appropriate for the amortization of our dvd library and the initial fixed license fee because it approximates dvd utilization 

  

in addition we have also determined that we are selling fewer previously rented dvds than estimated but at an average selling price higher than historically estimated we have therefore revised our estimate of salvage values on direct purchase dvds for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives a salvage value of 300 per dvd has been provided effective july 1 2004 for those dvds that we do not expect to sell no salvage value is provided simultaneously with the change in estimate of expected salvage value we recorded a writeoff of approximately 19 million related to nonrecoverable salvage value as a result of this writeoff total cost of revenues was 19 million higher net income was 19 million lower and net income per diluted share was 003 lower for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

we will continue to periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvd library 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we account for stockbased compensation expenses in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation 

  

index to financial statements as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 during 2002 2003 and 2004 we recorded total stockbased compensation expenses of 88 million 107 million and  166 million respectively the application of sfas no 123 requires significant judgment including the determination of the expected life and volatility for stock options to determine the expected life we review the historical pattern of exercises of stock options as well as the terms and vesting periods of the options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 we granted stock options which generally vest over three to fouryear periods since the third quarter of 2003 we began granting fully vested stock options to our employees on a monthly basis as a result we changed the expected life from 35 years to 15 years in the second quarter of 2004 we revised our estimate of expected life based on our review of historical patterns for exercises of stock options we bifurcated our option grants into two employee groupings who exhibited different exercise behavior and changed the estimate of the expected life from 15 years for all option grants in the first quarter of 2004 to 1 year for one group and 25 years for the other group beginning in the second quarter of 2004 in addition our stock price has fluctuated significantly in recent periods in estimating expected volatility we consider historical volatility volatility in markettraded options on our common stock and other relevant factors in accordance with sfas no 123 the blackscholes optionpricing model used by us requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted 

  

income taxes 

  

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

  

our deferred tax assets primarily the tax benefits of these loss carryforwards have been offset by a full valuation allowance because of our history of losses through the first quarter of 2003 limited profitable quarters to date and the competitive landscape of online dvd rentals if we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable the result would be a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 

  

descriptions of statement of operations components 

  

subscription revenues 

  

we generate all our subscription revenues in the united states we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscriber’s monthly subscription period we record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues in addition to our standard service of 1799 per month we offer other service plans with different price points that allow subscribers to keep either fewer or more titles at the same time as of december 31 2004 more than 95 percent of our paying subscribers paid 1799 or more per month 

  

cost of subscription revenues 

  

we acquire titles for our library through traditional direct purchase and through revenue sharing agreements with content providers traditional buying methods normally result in higher upfront costs than titles obtained through revenue sharing agreements cost of subscription revenues consists of revenue sharing expenses 

  

index to financial statements amortization of our library amortization of intangible assets related to equity instruments issued to certain studios in 2000 and 2001 and postage and packaging costs related to shipping titles to paying subscribers costs related to freetrial subscribers are allocated to marketing expenses 

  

revenue sharing expenses our revenue sharing agreements generally commit us to pay an initial upfront fee for each dvd acquired and also a percentage of revenue earned from such dvd rentals for a defined period of time a portion of the initial upfront fees are nonrecoupable for revenue sharing purposes and capitalized and amortized in accordance with our dvd library amortization policy the remaining portion of the initial upfront fee represents prepaid revenue sharing and this amount is expensed as revenue sharing expenses as dvds subject to revenue sharing agreements are shipped to subscribers other than the initial upfront payment for dvds acquired we are not obligated to pay any minimum revenue sharing fee on dvds that are not shipped to subscribers we characterize these payments to the studios as revenue sharing expenses 

  

amortization of dvd library on july 1 2004 we revised the estimate of useful life for the backcatalogue dvd library from one to three years new releases will continue to be amortized over a oneyear period we also revised our estimate of salvage values on direct purchase dvds for those direct purchase dvds that we expect to sell at the end of their useful lives a salvage value of 300 per dvd has been provided effective july 1 2004 for those dvds that we do not expect to sell no salvage value is provided 

  

amortization of intangible assets in 2000 in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with columbia tristar home entertainment dreamworks international distribution and warner home video we agreed to issue to each of these studios our series f nonvoting preferred stock equal to 1204 percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding in 2001 in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with twentieth century fox home entertainment and universal studios home video we agreed to issue to each of the two studios our series f nonvoting preferred stock equal to 1204 percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding as of december 31 2001 the aggregate of series f nonvoting preferred stock granted to these five studios equaled 602 percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding our obligation to maintain the studios’ equity interests at 602 percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding terminated immediately prior to our initial public offering in may 2002 the studios’ series f preferred stock automatically converted into 3192830 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering we measured the original issuances and any subsequent adjustments using the fair value of the securities at the issuance and any subsequent adjustment dates the fair value was recorded as an intangible asset and is amortized to cost of subscription revenues ratably over the remaining term of the agreements which initial terms were either three or five years 

  

postage and packaging postage and packaging expenses consist of the postage costs to mail titles to and from our paying subscribers and the packaging and label costs for the mailers the rate for firstclass postage was 034 prior to june 29 2002 and increased to 037 thereafter it is currently anticipated that the us postal service will seek an increase in the rate of first class postage and that any such increase would likely be effective starting in 2006 

  

operating expenses 

  

fulfillment fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our shipping and customer service centers including costs attributable to receiving inspecting and warehousing our library fulfillment expenses also include credit card fees 

  

technology and development technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related expenses we incur related to testing maintaining and modifying our web site our recommendation service developing solutions for downloading movies to subscribers telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internaluse software systems technology and development expenses also include depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our web site and store our data

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive finance content acquisition and administrative personnel as well as recruiting professional fees and other general corporate expenses 

  

stockbased compensation during the second quarter of 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 for stockbased compensation we elected to apply the retroactive restatement method under sfas no 148 and all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the compensation costs that would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 been applied to all awards granted 

  

during the third quarter of 2003 we began granting stock options to our employees on a monthly basis the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately in comparison with the three to fouryear vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 as a result of immediate vesting all stockbased compensation expense determined under sfas no 123 is fully recognized upon the grant of the stock option for those stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 with three to fouryear vesting periods we continue to amortize the deferred compensation related to those stock options over the remaining vesting periods 

  

index to financial statements results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods presented the line items in our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k 

  

   

revenues 

  

   

we currently generate all of our revenues in the united states we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscriber’s monthly subscription period in addition we generate a small portion of our revenues from the sale of used dvds and recognize such revenues when the dvds are shipped 

  

index to financial statements the increase in our subscription revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily as a result of substantial growth in the average number of paying subscribers and to a lesser extent due to a slight increase in average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber we believe the increase in the number of paying subscribers was driven by the continuing consumer adoption of dvd players increased consumer awareness of our service and continuing improvements in our service the increase in the average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber was a result of the price increase implemented in the second quarter of 2004 in june 2004 we increased the monthly subscription price of our standard service from 1995 to 2199 however effective november 2004 in response to the changing competitive landscape we lowered the price of our standard service to 1799 as a result of the price decrease we expect the average monthly subscription revenue per paying subscriber to decrease in 2005 

  

the increase in our subscription revenues in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of paying subscribers we believe the increase in the number of paying subscribers was driven by the continuing consumer adoption of dvd players increased consumer awareness of our service and continuing improvements in our service 

  

churn declined to 44 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 from 48 percent in the same period of 2003 and from 63 in the same period of 2002 we believe the decline was primarily attributable to three reasons 

  

   

   

   

we anticipate that churn will increase in face of competition from existing competitors and other potential new entrants in the online movie rental subscription business in particular we face intense competition from blockbuster which introduced its instore subscription program on a nationwide basis in may 2004 launched its online subscription service in august 2004 reduced the price of its online subscription service to 1499 per month in december 2004 and eliminated late fees for instore rentals in january 2005 if we are unable to compete effectively against blockbuster and our other existing competitors as well as against potential new entrants into the online movie rental subscription business such as amazon in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers our churn will likely increase and our business will be adversely affected 

  

the following table presents our ending subscriber information 

  

   

index to financial statements cost of revenues 

  

   

the increase in cost of subscription revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

the increase in cost of subscription revenues in absolute dollars in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

index to financial statements gross margin 

  

   

gross margin for 2004 declined slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 this decline was attributable to the decline in revenue per paid shipment offset almost wholly by the change in estimate related to the useful life of our backcatalogue dvd library if movie rentals per average paying subscriber increases additional erosion in our gross margin will occur 

  

the decline in gross margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a higher percentage of dvd amortization as a result of increased acquisitions for our library coupled with a higher percentage of postage and packaging expenses as a result of an increase in movie rentals per average paying subscriber the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a lower percentage of revenue sharing expenses as a result of our rental mix shifting proportionately in favor of purchased titles and away from titles subject to revenue sharing agreements 

  

operating expenses 

  

fulfillment 

  

   

the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers coupled with an increase in credit card fees as a result of the increase in subscriptions in addition the increase in fulfillment expenses was attributable to an increase in facilityrelated costs resulting from the relocation or expansion of certain of our shipping centers and the addition of new ones as a percentage of revenues fulfillment expenses decreased slightly primarily due to a combination of an increasing revenue base and efficiencies that reduced the fulfillment costs per paid shipment by approximately 10 percent 

  

the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers in addition our credit card fees increased significantly in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of the increase in subscriptions as a percentage of revenues fulfillment expenses decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to a combination of an increasing revenue base and improvements in our fulfillment productivity due to our continuous efforts to refine and streamline our fulfillment operations 

  

technology and development 

  

   

the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily the result of an increase in personnelrelated costs as a percentage of revenues technology and 

  

index to financial statements development expenses decreased primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than technology and development expenses 

  

the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of an increase in personnelrelated costs partially offset by a modest decrease in the depreciation of computer hardware and capitalized software as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses decreased primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than technology and development expenses 

  

we continuously research and test a variety of potential improvements to our internal hardware and software systems in an effort to improve our productivity and enhance our subscribers’ experience additionally we are developing solutions for downloading movies to subscribers as a result we expect our technology and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in 2005 

  

marketing 

  

   

the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing program costs primarily television and online advertising to attract new subscribers in addition personnelrelated costs increased in order to support the higher volume of marketing activities as a percentage of revenues the increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in marketing expenses than revenues subscriber acquisition cost increased in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of an increase in marketing program spending primarily the introduction of television advertising as an acquisition channel and increases in online advertising rates 

  

the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of new subscriber additions which resulted in higher marketing program costs in addition personnelrelated costs increased in order to support the higher volume of marketing activities subscriber acquisition cost increased in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily as a result of an increase in certain marketing program payments partially offset by the continued growth of wordofmouth as a source of subscriber acquisitions and lower personnelrelated costs on a peracquired subscriber basis as a percentage of revenues the decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than marketing expenses 

  

we anticipate that our marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in 2005 as we grow our business

the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs as well as an increase in professional fees to 

  

index to financial statements support our growing operations and compliance requirements as a percentage of revenues the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than general and administrative expenses 

  

the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of personnel as well as an increase in insurance costs and professional fees to support our growing business as a percentage of revenues the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than general and administrative expenses 

  

we expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in 2005 in order to support our growing operations 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

   

we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 for stockbased employee compensation in the second quarter of 2003 we elected to apply the retroactive restatement method under sfas no 148 and all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the compensation costs that would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 been applied to all awards granted to employees 

  

we began granting fully vested stock options to our employees on a monthly basis beginning in the third quarter of 2003 stockbased compensation expenses associated with these stock options are recognized immediately for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 with three to fouryear vesting periods we continue to amortize the deferred compensation associated with these stock options over their remaining vesting periods 

  

we apply the blackscholes optionpricing model to value our stock option grants the blackscholes optionpricing model used by us requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

  

the increase in stockbased compensation expenses in absolute dollars in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher expenses resulting from larger grants higher average grant prices and higher volatility assumptions in the current year than in the prioryear 

  

the increase in stockbased compensation expenses in absolute dollars in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to higher compensation expenses as a result of the fully vested monthly stock option grants coupled with a rising stock price in addition the increase was also attributable to higher compensation expenses associated with shares of common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 

  

interest and other income 

  

   

interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments prior to the liquidation of our shortterm investments during the second quarter of 2004 

  

index to financial statements the increase in interest and other income in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase in interest and other income as a result of higher average interest earning balances 

  

the increase in interest and other income in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income as a result of higher average cash and investment balances 

  

interest and other expense 

  

   

interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense related to our interestbearing obligations the decline in interest and other expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to lower interest expense as a result of a reduction in interestbearing obligations 

  

interest and other expense in 2002 included a onetime charge of 107 million associated with our early repayment following our initial public offering in may 2002 of all outstanding indebtedness under our subordinated promissory notes related to the acceleration of the accretion of the unamortized discount excluding the onetime charge of 107 million incurred in 2002 interest and other expense decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a reduction in interestbearing obligations some of which were repaid following our initial public offering in may 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

since inception we have financed our activities primarily through a series of private placements of convertible preferred stock subordinated promissory notes our initial public offering and net cash generated from operating activities as of december 31 2004 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1745 million we have generated net cash from operations during each quarter since the second quarter of 2001 in order to continue to generate cash from our operations we must increase our revenues while controlling our operating expenses many factors will impact our ability to grow revenues including but not limited to the number of subscribers who sign up for our service the growth or reduction in our subscriber base and our ability to develop new revenue sources in addition we may have to lower our prices and increase our marketing expenses in response to the aggressive competition from blockbuster and other potential entrants in the market although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations together with our available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

  

key components of cash flow 

  

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities 

  

   

index to financial statements operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by 578 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income adjusted for an increase in noncash amortization of our dvd library as a result of increased purchases of titles an increase in stockbased compensation expense and an increase in deferred revenue due to a larger subscriber base 

  

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to net income generated in 2003 as compared to a net loss incurred in 2002 adjusted for an increase in the amortization of our dvd library as a result of increased purchases of titles during 2003 an increase in accounts payable as a result of our growing operations an increase in deferred revenue due to a larger subscriber base and an increase in stockbased compensation expenses this increase in net cash was partially offset by the decrease in noncash interest expense in 2003 noncash interest expense included a onetime charge of 107 million related to an early debt repayment in 2002 

  

investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to increased purchases of titles for our dvd library to support our larger subscriber base and increased purchases of property and equipment to support our growing operations in 2004 as compared to 2003 however the increase was partially offset by net proceeds of 450 million from the sale of our shortterm investments 

  

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to substantially smaller purchases of shortterm investments in 2003 purchases of shortterm investments were significantly higher in 2002 as a result of the proceeds from our initial public offering in may 2002 this decrease in net cash was partially offset by an increase in both the purchases of property and equipment to support our growing business and the acquisitions of dvd titles for our library to support our larger subscriber base in 2003 

  

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in the repayment of debt and other obligations offset partially by lower proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 

  

the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to substantially smaller proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2003 proceeds from the issuance of common stock were significantly higher in 2002 as a result of our initial public offering this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in the repayment of debt and other obligations in 2003 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2004 in thousands 

  

  

    

   

index to financial statements for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as part of our ongoing business we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities accordingly our operating results financial condition and cash flows are not subject to offbalance sheet risks 

  

indemnifications 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 

  

the terms of such obligations vary generally a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated so the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated to date we have not incurred material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2004 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on eitf issue 048 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share which requires the inclusion of shares related to contingently convertible debt instruments for computing diluted earnings per share using the ifconverted method regardless of whether the market price contingency has been met eitf 048 will be effective for all periods ending after december 15 2004 and includes retroactive adjustment to historically reported diluted earnings per share the adoption of eitf issue no 048 does not currently have an impact on our operating results or financial position 

  

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 151 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges the provisions of sfas 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas 151 is not expected to have a significant impact on our operating results or financial position 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance sfas no 153 will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of sfas no 153 does not currently have an impact on our operating results or financial position 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services this standard replaces 

  

index to financial statements sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stockbased compensation this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no 25 sfas no 123r will be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after june 15 2005 we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation in the second quarter of 2003 and restated prior periods at that time accordingly we believe sfas no 123r will not have a material impact on our balance sheet or operating results 

  

factors that may affect future results of operations 

  

if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

  

risks related to our business 

  

if our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful our revenues will be affected adversely 

  

we must continue to attract new subscribers to succeed we must continue to attract a large number of subscribers who have traditionally used video retailers video rental outlets cable channels such as hbo and showtime payperview and vod for inhome filmed entertainment in addition direct competition to our service namely from services like blockbuster online has increased significantly over the past year and will likely impact our ability to attract subscribers our ability to attract subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers a high quality experience for selecting viewing receiving and returning titles including providing accurate recommendations through our recommendation service furthermore if our competitors are able to offer similar service levels at lower prices our ability to attract subscribers will be adversely affected if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of high quality or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract subscribers in addition many of our new subscribers originate from wordofmouth advertising and referrals from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract new subscribers and as a result our revenues will be affected adversely 

  

if we experience excessive rates of churn our revenues and business will be harmed 

  

we must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently delivery takes too long the service is a poor value competitive services provide a better value andor experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be affected adversely 

  

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do the rapid growth of our online entertainment subscription business since our inception may continue to attract direct competition from larger companies with significantly greater financial resources and national brand recognition for example we have seen increased direct competition from blockbuster which launched its online service in august 2004 and could 

  

index to financial statements face competition from potential new entrants into the online dvd rental market such as amazoncom if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share revenues or profitability 

  

in addition many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from hollywood entertainment buy a dvd from walmart and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month new competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost dvds represent only one of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing filmed entertainment in addition the growth in adoption of dvd technology is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors and technologies we may not be able to achieve adequate market share increase our revenues or maintain profitability our principal competitors include or could include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and web site and systems development than we do there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current or new competitors at our new pricing levels or at even lower price points in the future furthermore we may need to adjust the level of service provided to our subscribers andor incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate as a result of this increased competition we have seen and may continue to see a reduction in operating margins and market share 

  

if we are unable to offset increased demand for titles with increased subscriber retention or operating margins our operating results may be affected adversely 

  

there is no established limit to the number of movies that subscribers may rent historically we have seen the average number of movies rented per subscriber increase on an annual basis we believe that this increase in usage is influenced by improvements to our service as well as consumer usage habits we have established a nationwide network of distribution centers which provides subscribers with fast delivery of their rented dvds we are continually enhancing our service in ways that may impact subscriber movie usage such improvements include new product features on our website as well as software and process upgrades in addition demand for titles may increase for a variety of reasons beyond our control including promotion by studios and seasonal variations or shifts in consumer movie watching our subscribers may continue to increase their usage of our service which would increase our operating costs if our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of increased operating costs our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

in addition our subscriber growth and retention may be affected adversely if we attempt to increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles 

  

index to financial statements if our subscribers select titles that are more expensive for us to acquire and deliver more frequently our expenses will increase 

  

certain titles cost us more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they are acquired and the terms on which they are acquired if subscribers select these titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected our revenue sharing and other dvd acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected 

  

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results will be affected adversely 

  

the netflix brand is relatively new and we must continue to build strong brand identity to succeed we must continue to attract and retain a large number of owners of dvd players who have traditionally relied on storebased rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service through our web site in addition we will have to compete for subscribers against other brands which have greater recognition than ours such as blockbuster and walmart we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will only increase in light of competition both for online subscription services and other means of distributing titles such as vod from timetotime our subscribers express dissatisfaction with our service including among others things our inventory allocation and delivery processing to the extent such dissatisfaction is widespread or not adequately addressed our brand may be adversely impacted if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers will be affected adversely 

  

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our marketing expenses may increase 

  

we utilize a mix of incentivebased and fixedcost marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain a large portion of our new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including third party banner ads popunder placements direct links and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including television and radio advertising consumer package insertions as well as pointofsale programs with retailers we also acquire a number of subscribers who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership while we opportunistically adjust our mix of incentivebased and fixedcost marketing programs we attempt to manage the marketing expenses to come within a prescribed range of acquisition cost per new subscriber if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our marketing expenses may increase 

  

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us or are adverse to our business if companies that currently promote our service decide to enter our business or a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors we may no longer be given access to such channels in addition laws and regulations impose restrictions on the use of certain channels including commercial email and direct mail we may limit or discontinue use or support of email and other activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be affected adversely 

  

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 we anticipate further expanding our operations to help grow our subscriber base and to take advantage of favorable market opportunities any 

  

index to financial statements future expansion will likely place significant demands on our managerial operational administrative and financial resources if we are not able to respond effectively to new or increased demands that arise because of our growth or if in responding our management is materially distracted from our current operations our business may be affected adversely in addition if we do not have sufficient breadth and depth of the titles necessary to satisfy increased demand arising from growth in our subscriber base our subscriber satisfaction may be affected adversely 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict due to a number of factors that also will affect our longterm performance 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate in the future based on a variety of factors many of which are outside our control and difficult to predict in particular we have a limited operating history and have faced limited direct competition as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indicator of our future or longterm performance the following factors may affect us from period to period and may affect our longterm performance 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to these factors our operating results may fluctuate based upon seasonal fluctuations in dvd player sales and in the use of the internet during our limited operating history we have experienced greater additions of new subscribers during late fall and the winter months and these seasonal fluctuations may continue in future periods 

  

index to financial statements we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

  

we use complex proprietary software to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations our proprietary technology is intended to allow our nationwide network of shipping centers to be operated on an integrated basis we continually enhance or modify the software used for our distribution operations we cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of dvds among our shipping centers in a timely and efficient manner our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired 

  

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays caused by bioterrorism potential labor activism and inclement weather for example in the fall of 2001 terrorists used the us postal service to deliver envelopes containing anthrax following which mail deliveries around the united states experienced significant delays our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

  

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit and marketing expenses 

  

increases in postage delivery rates will adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase the us postal service has announced that it will seek an increase in the rate for first class postage in 2006 the extent of this rate increase is not yet known in addition the us postal service has announced longterm plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs for our dvds and our gross margin could be affected adversely also if the us postal service curtails its services such as discontinuing or reducing saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be affected adversely 

  

currently most filmed entertainment is packaged on a single lightweight dvd our delivery process is designed to accommodate the delivery of one dvd to fulfill a selection because of the lightweight nature of a dvd we generally mail one envelope containing a title using standard us postage studios occasionally provide additional content on a second dvd or may package a title on two dvds in addition the studios have recently announced plans to release certain films in high definition format on either hddvd’s or bluray dvds these new dvds have characteristics that are different than those currently in circulation these highdefinition format dvds may be heavier andor more fragile than current dvds if packaging of filmed entertainment on multiple dvds were to become more prevalent if the weight of dvds were to increase or the durability of dvds deteriorate our costs of delivery and fulfillment processing would increase and our costs of replacing damaged dvd’s may rise materially which would depress gross margins and profitability and adversely affect free cash flow 

  

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation service our business may suffer 

  

based on proprietary algorithms our recommendation service enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandize our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation 

  

index to financial statements service to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure you that the proprietary algorithms in our recommendation service will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

  

we are continually refining our recommendation service in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing such refinements in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation service 

  

if our recommendation service does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

  

   

   

   

if we do not correctly anticipate our short and longterm needs for titles our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be affected adversely 

  

if we do not acquire sufficient copies of titles we may not satisfy subscriber demand and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be affected adversely conversely if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be affected adversely 

  

if consumer adoption of dvd players slows our business could be adversely affected 

  

the rapid adoption of dvd players has been fueled by strong retail and studio support and falling dvd player prices if retailers or studios reduce their support of the dvd format or if manufacturers raise prices continued dvd adoption by consumers could slow if new or existing technologies were to become more popular at the expense of the adoption or use of dvd technology consumers may delay or avoid purchasing dvd players our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by future consumer adoption of dvd players and if such adoption slows our subscriber growth may also slow 

  

we depend on studios to release titles on dvd for an exclusive time period following theatrical release 

  

our ability to attract and retain subscribers is related to our ability to offer new releases of filmed entertainment on dvds prior to their release to other distribution channels except for theatrical release dvds currently enjoy a significant competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early distribution window for dvds the window for dvd rental and retail sales is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview premium television basic cable and network and syndicated television the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies our business could suffer increased competition if 

  

   

   

the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the title and we cannot assure you that the studios will not change their policies in the future in a manner that would be adverse to our business and results of operations 

  

index to financial statements in addition any conditions that adversely affect the movie industry including constraints on capital financial difficulties regulatory requirements and strikes work stoppages or other disruptions involving writers actors or other essential personnel could adversely affect the availability of new titles consumer demand for filmed entertainment and our business 

  

if we are unable to renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us or if the cost of purchasing titles on a wholesale basis increases our gross margins may be affected adversely 

  

since 2000 we have entered into numerous revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors these revenue sharing agreements generally have terms of up to five years the length of time we share revenue on each title is a fixed period as our revenue sharing agreements expire we may be required to negotiate new terms that could be disadvantageous to us 

  

during the course of our revenue sharing relationship with studios and distributors various contract administration issues arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors may be adversely impacted 

  

titles that we do not acquire under a revenue sharing agreement are purchased on a wholesale basis from studios or other distributors if the price of purchased titles increases our gross margin will be affected adversely 

  

if the sales price of dvds to retail consumers decreases our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

the cost of manufacturing dvds is substantially less than the price for which new dvds are generally sold in the retail market thus we believe that studios and other resellers of dvds have significant flexibility in pricing dvds for retail sale if the retail price of dvds decreases significantly consumers may choose to purchase dvds instead of subscribing to our service 

  

if vod or other technologies are widely adopted and supported as a method of content delivery by the studios and consumers our business could be adversely affected 

  

some digital cable providers and a limited number of internet content providers have implemented technology referred to as vod this technology transmits movies and other entertainment content on demand with interactive capabilities such as start stop and rewind in addition to being available from a small number of cable providers vod has been introduced over the internet as highspeed internet access has greatly increased the speed and quality of viewing content including featurelength movies on personal computers in addition other technologies have been developed that allow alternative means for consumers to receive and watch movies or other entertainment if vod or other technologies become affordable and viable alternative methods of content delivery widely supported by studios and adopted by consumers our business could be adversely affected 

  

we may need additional capital and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available 

  

historically we have funded our operations and capital expenditures through proceeds from private equity and debt financings equipment leases and cash flow from operations although we currently anticipate that the proceeds from our may 2002 initial public offering together with our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

  

index to financial statements any significant disruption in service on our web site or in our computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers 

  

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site where the title selection process is integrated with our delivery processing systems and software our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our web site network infrastructure and fulfillment processes interruptions in these systems could make our web site unavailable and hinder our ability to fulfill selections much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems service interruptions or the unavailability of our web site could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

  

our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our web site service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our general business disruption insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our web site or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our communications hardware and the computer hardware used to operate our web site are hosted at the facilities of a third party provider hardware for our delivery systems is maintained in our shipping centers fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely as we do not maintain entirely redundant systems a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations and could adversely affect our business problems faced by our third party web hosting provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its customers including us could impact adversely the experience of our subscribers 

  

our executive offices and our sunnyvalebased shipping center are located in the san francisco bay area in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations would be affected adversely 

  

our executive offices and our sunnyvalebased shipping center which also houses our customer service operations are located in the san francisco bay area our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of electrical blackouts fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations due to disruptions in service in the san francisco bay area or any other facility because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our sunnyvalebased operations center and the surrounding transportation infrastructure we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes 

  

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business and new service developments 

  

we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board w barry mccarthy jr our chief financial officer thomas r dillon our chief operations officer leslie j kilgore our chief marketing officer theodore a sarandos chief content officer and neil d hunt our chief product officer in addition much of our key technology and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of these or other key personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 

  

index to financial statements privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data 

  

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendation service we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

  

to secure transmission of confidential information obtained by us for billing purposes including subscribers’ credit card or checking account data we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology in conjunction with the payment processing companies we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data if despite these measures we experience any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers and our business could be affected adversely similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

  

in addition because we obtain subscribers’ billing information on our web site we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

  

our relationship with subscribers and payment processing companies could be harmed if our billing software fails 

  

in the past we have experienced problems with our subscriber billing software causing us to over bill subscribers although we have and will continue to credit the accounts of the subscribers we over bill problems with our billing software may have an adverse effect on our subscriber satisfaction and may cause one or more of the major payment processing or credit companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products in addition if our billing software fails and we fail to bill subscribers our cash flow and results of operations will be affected adversely 

  

increases in payment processing fees would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards debit cards and electronic checks our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees from time to time these fees may increase we expect some if not all of the payment processing companies will further increase their transaction fees in 2005 such increase will adversely affect our results of operations if we elect not to raise our subscription rates to offset the increase 

  

index to financial statements if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

  

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights netflix is a registered trademark of netflix inc we have also filed trademark applications in the united states for the netflixcom and cinematch names and for the netflix design logo and have filed us patent applications for certain aspects of our technology we have also filed trademark applications in certain foreign countries for the netflix name from time to time we expect to file additional trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

  

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site our recommendation service title selection processes and marketing activities 

  

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights as discussed in “item 3—legal proceedings” we have been sued for alleged patent infringement by btg if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights or develop noninfringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights our business and competitive position may be affected adversely many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology defending ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel it also may result in our inability to use our current web site or our recommendation service or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandizing or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

  

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be affected adversely 

  

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could affect adversely our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable to prevent third 

  

index to financial statements parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

  

because our business is accessed over the internet if the internet infrastructure is not developed or maintained we will lose subscribers 

  

the internet may not become a viable commercial marketplace for many potential subscribers due to inadequate development of network infrastructure and enabling technologies that address consumer concerns about 

  

   

   

   

   

   

 the internet has experienced a variety of outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and it could face outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could frustrate public use of the internet including use of our web site in addition the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or due to governmental regulation 

  

if we become subject to liability for the internet content that we publish or upload from our users our results of operations would be affected adversely 

  

as a publisher of online content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute 

  

we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and harm our results of operations we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover claims of these types or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed on us 

  

if government regulation of the internet or other areas of our business changes or if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change we may need to change the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

  

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

  

the manner in which internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business 

  

index to financial statements in addition if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change consumers may become unwilling to select their entertainment online or otherwise provide us with information necessary for them to become subscribers further we may not be able to effectively market our services online to users of the internet if we are unable to interact with consumers because of changes in their attitude toward use of the internet our subscriber acquisition and retention may be affected adversely 

  

we may be engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention 

  

from time to time we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position such disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses could occupy a significant amount of our management’s time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 

  

recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase our costs 

  

recently enacted changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission have increased and may continue to increase our expenses as we evaluate the implications of these rules and devote resources to respond to their requirements 

  

the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is listed has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties as a result we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which would adversely affect our business 

  

risks related to our stock ownership 

  

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over netflix 

  

as of december 31 2004 our executive officers and directors their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 32 percent of our outstanding common stock warrants and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days in particular jay hoag one of our directors beneficially owned approximately 21 percent and reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board beneficially owned approximately 10 percent these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from yours and will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

  

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

  

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

  

   

index to financial statements    

   

   

   

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 percent or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

  

our stock price is volatile 

  

the price at which our common stock has traded since our may 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

  

following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities we became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

  

we record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

  

during the second quarter of 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 for stockbased employee compensation in addition during the third quarter of 2003 we began granting stock options to our employees on a monthly basis the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately in comparison with the three to fouryear vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expenses determined under sfas no 123 is fully recognized in the same periods as the monthly stock option grants in addition we continue to amortize the deferred compensation of stock options with three to fouryear vesting periods granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 over the remaining vesting periods our stockbased compensation expenses totaled 88 million 107 million and 166 million during 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively we expect our stockbased compensation expenses will continue to be significant in future periods which will have an adverse impact on our operating results the blackscholes optionpricing model used by us requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

  

index to financial statements financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our financial results will be difficult because of our limited operating history and our actual results may differ from forecasts 

  

as a result of our growth our limited operating history and the changing competitive landscape it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenues gross margin operating expenses number of paying subscribers number of dvds shipped per day and other financial and operating data our inability or the inability of the financial community to accurately forecast our operating results could cause our net income losses in a given quarter to be less greater than expected which could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock we have a limited amount of meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses we base our current and forecasted expense levels and dvd acquisitions on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues which are dependent on the growth of our subscriber base and the demand for titles by our subscribers as a result we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts or to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls in revenues we believe that these difficulties in forecasting are even greater for financial analysts who may publish their own estimates of our financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline to minimize this risk we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of securities our cash equivalents are generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework our management has concluded that as of december 31 2004 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2004 that has materially affected or is reasonable likely to affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within netflix have been detected

 item 1 business 

  

we are the largest online movie rental subscription service in the united states providing more than 1487000 subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than 18000 movie television and other filmed entertainment titles our standard subscription plan allows subscribers to have three titles out at the same time with no due dates late fees or shipping charges for 1995 per month subscribers can view as many titles as they want in a month in addition to our standard plan we offer other service plans with different price points that allow subscribers to keep either fewer or more titles at the same time subscribers select titles at our web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service receive them on dvd by firstclass mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers once a title has been returned we mail the next available title in a subscriber’s queue 

  

our subscription service has grown rapidly since its launch in september 1999 we believe our growth has been driven primarily by our comprehensive selection of titles consistently high levels of customer satisfaction rapid consumer adoption of dvd players and our effective marketing programs in the san francisco bay area where we have had generally oneday delivery service since launch approximately 59 percent of all households subscribed to netflix at the end of 2003 

  

our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandize our comprehensive library of titles in the fourth quarter of 2003 more than 99 percent of our titles were selected by our subscribers to add to their queue in comparison most entertainment service providers promote a narrow selection of box office hits we believe that our recommendation technology based on proprietary algorithms and the more than 300 million movie ratings we have collected from our subscribers enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization 

  

we promote our service to consumers through various marketing programs including online promotions television advertising advertising insertions with most leading dvd player manufacturers and promotions with other third parties these programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and include a free trial period of 14 days at the end of the trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers unless they cancel their subscription approximately 90 percent of trial subscribers become paying subscribers all paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance 

  

we stock almost every title available on dvd excluding mature and adult content we have established revenue sharing relationships with more than 50 studios and distributors we also purchase titles directly from studios distributors and independent producers these relationships provide us access to titles on financial terms that are attractive to us 

  

we ship and receive dvds throughout the united states we maintain a nationwide network of shipping centers that allow us to provide fast delivery and return service to our subscribers as of december 31 2003 we were capable of providing more than 80 percent of our subscribers with generally oneday service 

  

we are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements 

  

we are organized in a single operating segment all our revenues are generated in the united states and substantially all our revenues are derived from monthly subscription fees 

  

industry overview 

  

filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels outofhome channels include movie theaters airlines and hotels inhome distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets cable and satellite television payperview videoondemand or vod and broadcast television currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately six months after theatrical release to the home video market seven to nine months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks however in what may be an emerging trend several of the major studios have recently shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window 

  

consumer transition to dvd 

  

the home video segment of the inhome filmed entertainment market has undergone a rapid technology transition away from vhs to dvd according to adams media research there were approximately 54 million us television households with a standalone settop dvd player representing 49 percent of us television households at the end of 2003 this number does not include other electronic devices such as computers and video game players many of which are also capable of playing dvds we believe this transition is analogous to the shift in the music industry from audio cassettes to compact discs which resulted in significant additional demand for both new releases and back catalogue inventory similarly we anticipate that dvd will for all practical purposes replace the vhs cassette and thereafter dvd will enjoy a similarly long consumer lifetime we provide titles to our subscribers on dvd only and have never carried vhs content 

  

challenges faced by consumers in selecting inhome filmed entertainment 

  

the proliferation of new releases available for inhome filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalogue titles on dvd create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles 

  

first despite the large number of available titles consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets subscription channels such as hbo and showtime and payperview services currently offer a narrow selection of titles at specified times due to programming schedule constraints and technological issues relating to channel capacity traditional video rental outlets primarily offer new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalogue titles 

  

second even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service provides our subscribers the tools to select titles that appeal to their individual preferences 

  

competitive strengths 

  

we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths 

  

   

   

   

   

growth strategy 

  

our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements 

  

   

   

   

our web site—wwwnetflixcom 

  

we have applied substantial resources to plan develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our web site such as subscription account signup and management personalized movie merchandising inventory optimization and customer support our software is written in a variety of languages and runs on industry standard platforms 

  

our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare each subscriber’s title preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database this technology enables us to provide personalized movie recommendations unique to each subscriber 

  

we believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service each subscriber’s current queue and viewing history inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to promote to each subscriber our proprietary movie search engine indexes our extensive library by title actor and director 

  

our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers we use a realtime postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to assure speedy and accurate delivery we use an online credit card authorization service to help our subscribers avoid typographic errors in their credit card entries these features help prevent fraud and subscriber disappointment resulting from failures to initiate a trial 

  

throughout our web site we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities allowing us to continuously optimize our web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers we use random control testing extensively 

  

our web site is run on hardware and software colocated at a service provider offering reliable network connections power air conditioning and other essential infrastructure we manage our web site 24 hours a day seven days a week we utilize a variety of proprietary software freely available and commercially supported tools integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnose and recover from failures we conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers 

  

merchandizing 

  

the key to our merchandizing efforts is the personal recommendations generated by our recommendation service all subscribers and site visitors are given many opportunities to rate titles the ratings from our recommendation service determine which available titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order for example our subscribers can find recently released titles more easily by ranking new releases by user preference rather than by new release date allowing them to quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy ratings also determine which available titles are featured in lead page positions on our web site to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity finally data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our “recommendations” link to find other titles they may enjoy this has proven to be a powerful method for catalogue browsing 

  

recommendations are available to anyone who has rated titles on our web site whether or not they are a subscriber by aggregating the ratings of our subscribers and other visitors we have built what we believe to be the world’s largest personal movie ratings database containing more than 300 million ratings 

  

we also provide our subscribers with decision support information about each title in our library this information includes 

  

   

   

   

marketing 

  

we have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service online advertising is our largest paid source of new subscribers we advertise our service online through paid search listings permission based emails banner ads and text on popular web portals and other web sites in addition we have an affiliate program whereby we make available webbased banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a selfassisted basis from our web site and place on their web sites third parties that place our advertisements and generate online subscriber referrals are generally paid a cash bounty for each subscriber referred to us with no minimum or maximum amounts for which we are liable we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of wordofmouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations programs during 2003 online and wordofmouth advertising accounted for approximately 85 percent of all new trial subscriber acquisitions 

  

we work with a number of other channels on an opportunistic basis for example we have agreements with leading dvd player manufacturers requiring them to place inside certain dvd player boxes a netflix insert that describes our service and offers a free trial we also have a relationship with a leading consumer electronics and video retailer which involves a variety of promotional efforts using pointofsale materials stickers on product packaging and other items to promote netflix in its stores and those of its subsidiaries in addition we launched our television advertising campaigns in select markets beginning in january 2004 following a test in several markets during the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

content acquisition 

  

we acquire content either through revenue sharing agreements or direct purchases under our revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time after the revenue sharing period expires for a title the agreements generally grant us the right to acquire for a minimal fee a 

  

percentage of the units for retention or sale by us the balance of the units are destroyed or returned to the originating studio the principal terms of each agreement are similar in nature but are generally unique to each studio in addition to revenue sharing agreements we also purchase titles from various studios distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis 

  

fulfillment operations 

  

we currently stock more than 18000 titles on more than 12 million dvds during december 2003 we shipped to and received from subscribers more than 18 million dvds we have allocated substantial resources to developing maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our web site transaction processing systems fulfillment operations inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers 

  

we ship and receive dvds from numerous shipping centers located throughout the united states we believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for subscribers by shortening the transit time for our dvds through the us postal service based on performance standards established by the us postal service for its postal zones we currently provide oneday delivery service to approximately 61 percent of the us population or 80 percent of our subscribers we anticipate increasing such oneday coverage marginally as we open additional shipping centers to meet our growing demand 

  

customer service 

  

we believe that our ability to establish and maintain longterm relationships with subscribers depends in part on the strength of our customer support and service operations we encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our subscribers in order to continually improve our web site and our service our customer service center is open seven days a week we utilize email to proactively correspond with subscribers we also offer phone support for subscribers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative we focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and automating certain selfservice features on our web site such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems our customer service center is located in our san jose california facility 

  

competition 

  

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month 

  

video rental outlets and retailers with whom we compete include blockbuster hollywood entertainment amazoncom walmart stores and best buy in particular blockbuster has launched in 25 percent of its usbased operations a storebased subscription program in 2003 and plans to launch this program nationwide by the end of 2004 this program will provide many of the benefits of our business model in a storebased retail environment we believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection convenience and price we believe that our scalable business model our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 18000 titles compete favorably against traditional video rental outlets 

  

we also compete against other online dvd subscription services such as walmartcom and filmcaddycom a subsidiary of blockbuster subscription entertainment services such as hbo and showtime 

  

payperview and vod providers and cable and satellite providers blockbuster has announced that it plans to roll out an online subscription service in late 2004 and then integrate the online and storebased subscription programs sometime in 2005 we believe we are able to provide greater subscriber satisfaction due to the broader and deeper selection of titles we offer subscribers our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences as well as the ease and speed with which subscribers are able to select receive and return titles 

  

vod has received considerable media attention recently for example vod is now widely available in most major hotels and has early deployments in many major cable systems within a few years we believe vod will become widely available to digital cable and satellite subscribers vod carries as many titles as can be effectively merchandized on a settop box platform which we believe to be generally up to 100 recent releases plus adult content in late 2003 disney tested a proprietary broadcast vod service moviebeam which utilizes a settop device connected to the television set to allow subscribers to download and view approximately 100 films at any time for consumers who primarily want the latest big releases vod may be a convenient distribution channel we believe that our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base and our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences positions us favorably to provide digital distribution of filmed entertainment as that market develops 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had 567 fulltime employees we also utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in our fulfillment operations to respond to the fluctuating demand for dvd shipments as of december 31 2003 we had 224 temporary employees our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

  

intellectual property 

  

we use a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property in 2003 we were issued a broad business method patent covering among other things our subscription rental service the patent will expire in 2020 in addition to the patent covering the rental method invention we have filed additional patent applications we have a registered trademark for the netflix name and copyrights on the content of our web site we have filed applications for additional trademarks as well 

  

enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming to date we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and knowhow to protect our intellectual property it is uncertain if and when our other patent and trademark applications may be allowed and whether they will provide us with a competitive advantage 

  

from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we believe that our service offering does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party however we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute

new initiatives in 2004 

  

looking ahead we will continue to focus on our online dvd rental subscription service in the united states we will continue to make steady improvements in our service driving what we refer to as the “virtuous cycle” our continued service improvements create high subscriber satisfaction which results in lower subscriber churn and positive wordofmouth about our service this in turn helps us grow our subscriber base faster as we grow we continue to make more improvements to our service which drives the cycle again 

  

in addition to our core focus we are planning on executing the following new initiatives in 2004 

  

   

   

descriptions of statement of operations components 

  

subscription revenues 

  

we generate all our revenues in the united states we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscriber’s monthly subscription period we record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues in addition to our standard services of 1995 per month we offer other service plans with different price points that allow subscribers to keep either fewer or more titles at the same time as of december 31 2003 more than 92 percent of our paying subscribers paid 1995 or more per month 

  

cost of subscription revenues 

  

we acquire titles for our library through traditional direct purchase and revenue sharing agreements traditional buying methods normally result in higher upfront costs than titles obtained through revenue sharing agreements cost of subscription revenues consists of revenue sharing expenses amortization of our library amortization of intangible assets related to equity instruments issued to certain studios in 2000 and 2001 and postage and packaging costs related to shipping titles to paying subscribers costs related to freetrial subscribers are allocated to marketing expenses 

  

revenue sharing expenses  our revenue sharing agreements generally commit us to pay an initial upfront fee for each dvd acquired revenue sharing expenses are recorded as dvds subject to revenue sharing agreements are shipped to subscribers under certain of our revenue sharing agreements we pay an additional minimum revenue sharing fee for each dvd shipped to a subscriber other than the initial upfront payment for dvds acquired we are not obligated to pay any minimum revenue sharing fee on dvds that are not shipped to subscribers we characterize these payments to the studios as revenue sharing expenses 

  

amortization of dvd library  on january 1 2001 we shortened the estimated life of dvd library to one year and assumed a salvage value of 200 for the dvds that we believe we will eventually sell prior to january 1 2001 we amortized our cost of dvds using a “sumofthemonth” accelerated method over an estimated life of three years and assumed no salvage value 

  

amortization of intangible assets  in 2000 in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with columbia tristar home entertainment dreamworks international distribution and warner home video we agreed to issue to each of these studios our series f nonvoting preferred stock equal to 1204 percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding in 2001 in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with twentieth century fox home entertainment and universal studios home video we agreed to issue to each of the two studios our series f nonvoting preferred stock equal to 1204 percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding as of december 31 2001 the aggregate of series f nonvoting preferred stock granted to these five studios equaled 602 percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding our obligation to maintain the studios’ equity interests at 602 percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding terminated immediately prior to our initial public offering in may 2002 the studios’ series f preferred stock automatically converted into 3192830 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering we measured the original issuances and any subsequent adjustments using the fair value of the securities at the issuance and any subsequent adjustment dates the fair value was recorded as an intangible asset and is amortized to cost of subscription revenues ratably over the remaining term of the agreements which initial terms were either three or five years 

  

postage and packaging  postage and packaging expenses consist of the postage costs to mail titles to and from our paying subscribers and the packaging and label costs for the mailers the rate for firstclass postage was 034 prior to june 29 2002 and increased to 037 thereafter 

  

operating expenses 

  

fulfillment fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our shipping and customer service centers including costs attributable to receiving inspecting and warehousing our library fulfillment expenses also include credit card fees and other collectionrelated expenses 

  

technology and development technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related expenses we incur related to testing maintaining and modifying our web site our recommendation service telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internaluse software systems technology and development expenses also include depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our web site and store our data 

  

marketing marketing expenses consist of payroll and related expenses marketing program expenditures and other promotional activities including revenue sharing expenses postage and packaging expenses and library amortization related to free trial periods 

  

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive finance content acquisition and administrative personnel as well as recruiting professional fees and other general corporate expenses 

  

stockbased compensation during the second quarter of 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 for stockbased employee compensation we elected to apply the retroactive restatement method under sfas no 148 and all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the compensation costs that would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 been applied to all awards granted 

  

during the third quarter of 2003 we began granting stock options to our employees on a monthly basis the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately in comparison with the three to fouryear vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 as a result of immediate vesting all stockbased compensation expense determined under sfas no 123 is fully recognized upon the stock option grants for those stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 with three to fouryear vesting periods we continue to amortize the deferred compensation related to those stock options over the remaining vesting periods 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes the securities and exchange commission has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

amortization of dvd library and upfront costs 

  

in late 2000 and early 2001 we began entering into a series of revenue sharing agreements with studios which substantially changed our business model for acquiring dvds and satisfying subscriber demand for titles 

  

these revenue sharing agreements enable us to acquire dvds at a lower upfront cost than traditional direct purchase arrangements we share a percentage of the net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with these studios over a fixed period of time generally twelve months for each title at the end of the revenue sharing period for each title we typically have the option of either returning the dvds associated with the title to the studio or purchasing some or all of those dvds 

  

before the change in our business model we typically acquired fewer copies of a particular title and utilized each copy over a longer period of time the implementation of these revenue sharing agreements improved our ability to acquire larger quantities of newly released titles and satisfy a substantial portion of subscriber demand for such titles over a shorter period of time on january 1 2001 we revised the amortization policy for the cost of our library from a “sumofthemonth” accelerated method using a threeyear life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a oneyear life 

  

the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and was accounted for on a prospective basis from january 1 2001 had we continued to amortize the dvds acquired prior to january 1 2001 using a threeyear life amortization expense for 2001 would have been 47 million lower than the amount recorded in our financial statements 

  

under our revenue sharing agreements we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized certain of these payments also include a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is expensed as revenue sharing obligations are incurred the initial fixed license fee is amortized on a “sumofthemonth” basis over one year 

  

we believe the use of the accelerated method is appropriate for the amortization of our dvd library and the initial fixed license fee because we normally experience heavy initial demand for a title which subsides gradually once the initial demand has been satisfied 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we account for stockbased compensation expenses in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 during 2001 2002 and 2003 we recorded total stockbased compensation expenses of 63 million 88 million and 107 million respectively the application of sfas no 123 requires significant judgment including the determination of the expected life and volatility for stock options to determine the expected life we review the historical pattern of exercises of stock options prior to the third quarter of 2003 we granted stock options which generally vest over three to fouryear periods since the third quarter of 2003 we began granting fully vested stock options to our employees on a monthly basis as a result we changed the expected life from 35 years to 15 years in addition our stock price has fluctuated significantly and has risen considerably in recent periods these factors affect our assumptions used in determining the volatility given the volatile market conditions it is difficult to forecast our stockbased compensation expenses and changes in our assumptions could materially impact the amount of stockbased compensation expenses recorded in future periods 

  

income taxes 

  

we record a tax provision if any for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

  

if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable the respective valuation allowance would be reversed resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods presented the line items in our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report on form 10k 

  

   

revenues 

  

   

the increase in our subscription revenues from 2002 to 2003 and from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of paying subscribers we believe the increase in the number of paying subscribers was driven by the continuing consumer adoption of dvd players increased consumer awareness of our service and continuing improvements in our service 

  

subscriber churn declined to 48 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 from 63 percent in the same period of 2002 we believe the decline was primarily attributable to two reasons 

  

   

   

the following table presents our ending subscriber information 

  

   

cost of revenues 

  

   

the increase in cost of subscription revenues in absolute dollars from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

the increase in cost of subscription revenues in absolute dollars from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

the increase in cost of subscription revenues from 2001 to 2002 was partially offset by a 42 million decrease or 21 percent in dvd amortization the decrease was primarily attributable to a 47 million increase in amortization in 2001 which was caused by the change in the estimated life of our dvd library from three years to one year effective january 1 2001 partially offset by an increase in amortization related to increased acquisitions for our dvd library 

  

gross margin 

  

   

the decrease in gross margin from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to a higher percentage of dvd amortization as a result of increased acquisitions for our library coupled with a higher percentage of postage and packaging expenses as a result of an increase in disc usage per average paying subscriber the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a lower percentage of revenue sharing expenses as a result of our rental mix shifting proportionately in favor of purchased titles and away from titles subject to revenue sharing agreements 

  

gross margin increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily as a result of the growth in our subscription revenues and a decrease in our direct incremental costs of providing those subscription services coupled with the 21 percent reduction in dvd amortization 

  

operating expenses 

  

fulfillment 

  

   

the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from the higher volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers in addition our credit card fees increased 30 million from 2002 to 2003 as a result of the increase in subscriptions the increase in fulfillment expenses in absolute dollars from 2001 to 2002 was also attributable to an increase in personnelrelated costs coupled with a 17 million increase in credit card fees as a percentage of revenues fulfillment expenses decreased from 2002 to 2003 and from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a combination of an increasing revenue base and improvements in our fulfillment productivity due to our continuous efforts to refine and streamline our fulfillment operations 

  

as of december 31 2003 we were operating a nationwide network of shipping centers we anticipate opening additional shipping centers to continue to reduce delivery times and increase library utilization we expect our fulfillment expenses will increase in absolute dollars in 2004 as a result of higher credit card fees and the continued increase in the volume of activities in our customer service and shipping centers 

  

technology and development 

  

   

the increase in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of an increase in personnelrelated costs partially offset by a modest decrease in the depreciation of computer hardware and capitalized software as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses decreased primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than technology and development expenses 

  

the decrease in technology and development expenses in absolute dollars from 2001 to 2002 was primarily caused by decreases in personnelrelated costs as a result of employees terminated as part of our restructuring in 2001 as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses decreased primarily due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in the amount we spent on technology and development 

  

we continuously research and test a variety of potential improvements to our internal hardware and software systems in an effort to improve our productivity and enhance our subscribers’ experience as a result we expect our technology and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in 2004 

  

marketing 

  

   

the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of new subscriber additions which resulted in higher marketing program costs in addition personnelrelated costs increased in order to support the higher volume of marketing activities subscriber acquisition cost increased from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in certain marketing program payments partially offset by the continued growth of wordofmouth as a source of subscriber acquisitions and lower personnelrelated costs on a peracquired subscriber basis as a percentage of revenues the decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than marketing expenses 

  

the increase in marketing expenses in absolute dollars from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of new subscriber additions which resulted in higher marketing program costs in addition personnelrelated costs increased in order to support the higher volume of marketing activities however subscriber acquisition cost decreased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to costs related to free trials and personnelrelated costs increasing only moderately in absolute dollars but declining on a peracquired subscriber basis due to the large increase in new trial subscribers as a percentage of revenues the decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than marketing expenses 

  

we anticipate that our marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future periods as a result of an increase in the freetrial offers and other additional marketing programs in particular we plan to include 

  

television advertising into the mix of acquisition channels to grow our subscriber base however we believe that online and wordofmouth advertising will continue to be the primary sources of generating the bulk of new subscribers in 2004 

  

general and administrative 

  

   

the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars from 2002 to 2003 and from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of personnel as well as an increase in insurance costs and professional fees to support our growing business as a percentage of revenues the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a greater increase in revenues than general and administrative expenses 

  

we expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in 2004 in order to support our growing operations 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

   

we began granting fully vested stock options to our employees on a monthly basis beginning in the third quarter of 2003 compensation expenses associated with these stock options are immediately recognized for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 with three to fouryear vesting periods we continue to amortize the deferred compensation associated with these stock options over their remaining vesting periods using the accelerated method of amortization 

  

the increase in stockbased compensation expenses in absolute dollars from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to higher compensation expenses as a result of the fully vested monthly stock option grants coupled with a rising stock price in addition the increase was also attributable to higher compensation expenses associated with shares of common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 

  

the increase in stockbased compensation expenses in absolute dollars from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to higher amortization of deferred compensation of stock options with three to fouryear vesting periods coupled with compensation expenses associated with shares of common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan which was adopted during 2002 

  

the calculation of our stockbased compensation expenses is highly sensitive to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant our stock price has been volatile and as such it is difficult to predict our stockbased compensation expenses in future periods 

  

interest and other income 

  

   

the increase in interest and other income from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income as a result of higher average cash and investment balances 

  

the increase in interest and other income from 2001 to 2002 despite the decline in interest rates was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income in the second half of 2002 as a result of higher average cash and investment balances the increase in our cash and investment balances was primarily due to the proceeds from our initial public offering in may 2002 

  

interest and other expense 

  

   

interest and other expense in 2002 included a onetime charge of 107 million associated with our early repayment following our initial public offering in may 2002 of all outstanding indebtedness under our subordinated promissory notes related to the acceleration of the accretion of the unamortized discount 

  

excluding the onetime charge of 107 million incurred in 2002 interest and other expense decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a reduction in interestbearing obligations some of which were repaid following our initial public offering in may 2002 

  

interest expense increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to the onetime charge of 107 million incurred in 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

since inception we have financed our activities primarily through a series of private placements of convertible preferred stock subordinated promissory notes our initial public offering and cash generated from operating activities as of december 31 2003 we had cash and cash equivalents of 899 million and shortterm investments of 453 million although we currently anticipate that the proceeds from our initial public offering together with our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require or choose to obtain additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution please refer to “factors that may affect future results of operations” below for further discussion 

  

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities 

  

   

operating activities 

  

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to net income generated in 2003 as compared to a net loss incurred in 2002 adjusted for an increase in the amortization of our dvd library as a result of increased purchases of titles during 2003 an increase in accounts payable as a result of our growing operations an increase in deferred revenue due to a larger subscriber base and an increase in stockbased compensation expenses the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was partially offset by the decrease in noncash interest expense in 2003 noncash interest expense included a onetime charge of 107 million related to an early debt repayment in 2002 

  

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to a smaller net loss incurred in 2002 as compared to 2001 adjusted for an increase in deferred revenue due to a larger subscriber base an increase in interest expense due to a onetime charge of 107 million related to an early debt repayment and an increase in accrued expenses and stockbased compensation expenses the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from 2001 to 2002 was partially offset by the gain on disposal of dvds and a lower amortization of dvd library incurred in 2002 

  

investing activities 

  

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to substantially smaller purchases of shortterm investments in 2003 purchases of shortterm investments were significantly higher in 2002 as a result of the proceeds from our initial public offering in may 2002 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities from 2002 to 2003 was partially offset by an increase in both the purchases of property and equipment to support our growing business and the acquisitions of dvd titles for our library to support our larger subscriber base in 2003 

  

the increase in net cash used in investing activities from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to the purchases of shortterm investments in 2002 using the proceeds from our initial public offering coupled with an increase in the acquisitions of dvd titles for our library to support our growing subscriber base the increase in net cash used in investing activities from 2001 to 2002 was partially offset by proceeds generated from sales of dvds in 2002 

  

financing activities 

  

the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to substantially smaller proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2003 proceeds from the issuance of common stock were significantly higher in 2002 as a result of our initial public offering the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities from 2002 to 2003 was partially offset by a decrease in the repayment of debt and other obligations in 2003 

  

the increase in net cash provided by financing activities from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering in may 2002 partially offset by an increase in the repayment of debt and other obligations in 2002 

  

contractual obligations 

  

we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december 31 2003 we have obligations under noncancelable operating leases and capital leases with various expiration dates through 2006 future minimum lease payments under these leases are as follows 

  

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as part of our ongoing business we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities accordingly our operating results financial condition and cash flows are not subject to offbalance sheet risks 

  

indemnifications 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 

  

the terms of such obligations vary generally a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated so the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated to date we have not incurred material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements

factors that may affect future results of operations 

  

if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

  

risks related to our business 

  

if our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful our revenues will be affected adversely 

  

we must continue to attract and retain subscribers to succeed we must continue to attract a large number of subscribers who have traditionally used video retailers video rental outlets cable channels such as hbo and showtime payperview and vod for inhome filmed entertainment our ability to attract and retain subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers a high quality experience for selecting viewing receiving and returning titles including providing accurate recommendations through our recommendation service if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of high quality or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers in addition many of our new subscribers originate from wordofmouth advertising and referrals from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract new subscribers and as a result our revenues will be affected adversely 

  

if we experience excessive rates of subscriber churn our revenues and business will be harmed 

  

we must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently delivery takes too long the service is a poor value and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

  

if we are unable to offset increased demand for titles with increased subscriber retention or operating margins our operating results may be affected adversely 

  

subscribers to our service can view as many titles as they want every month and depending on the service plan may have out between two and eight titles at a time with our use of multiple shipping centers and the associated software and procedural upgrades we have reduced the transit time of dvds as a result our subscribers have been able to exchange more titles each month which has increased our operating costs as we establish additional shipping centers or further refine our distribution process we may see a continued increase in usage by our subscribers if our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of increased operating costs our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

in addition subscriber demand for titles may increase for a variety of other reasons beyond our control including promotion by studios and seasonal variations in movie watching our subscriber growth and retention may be affected adversely if we attempt to increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles 

  

if our subscribers select titles that are more expensive for us to acquire and deliver more frequently our expenses will increase 

  

certain titles cost us more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they are acquired and the terms on which they are acquired if subscribers select these titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected our revenue sharing and other dvd acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected 

  

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results will be affected adversely 

  

the netflix brand is young and we must continue to build strong brand identity to succeed we must continue to attract and retain a large number of owners of dvd players who have traditionally relied on storebased rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service through our web site we may be required to incur significantly higher advertising and promotional expenditures than we currently anticipate to attract large numbers of new subscribers we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will increase with a proliferation of dvd subscription services and other means of distributing titles such as vod if our efforts to promote and maintain our brand are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers will be affected adversely 

  

if we are unable to manage the mix of subscriber acquisition sources our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our marketing expenses may increase 

  

we utilize a mix of incentivebased and fixedcost marketing programs to promote our service to potential new subscribers we obtain a large portion of our new subscribers through our online marketing efforts including third party banner ads popunder placements direct links and permissionbased emails as well as our active affiliate program in addition we have engaged in various offline marketing programs including dvd player box insertions as well as pointofsale programs with retailers while we opportunistically adjust our mix of incentivebased and fixedcost marketing programs we attempt to manage the marketing expenses to come within a prescribed range of acquisition cost per subscriber to date we have been able to manage our acquisition cost per subscriber however if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of subscribers with similarly effective sources or if the cost of our existing sources increases our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our cost of marketing may increase 

  

if we are unable to continue using our current marketing channels our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by current means if such activities are no longer available to us or are adverse to our business laws and regulations have recently been enacted which impose restrictions on the use of commercial email we may discontinue use or support of email and other online activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem such activities intrusive which could affect our goodwill or brand in addition we may be foreclosed from certain channels due to competitive reasons if companies that currently promote our service decide to enter our business or a similar business we may no longer be given access to such channels if the available marketing channels are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be affected adversely 

  

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost dvds represent only one of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing filmed entertainment in addition the growth in adoption of dvd technology is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors and technologies we may not be able to achieve adequate market share increase our revenues or maintain profitability our principal competitors include or could include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

many of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and web site and systems development than we do the rapid growth of our online entertainment subscription business since our inception may attract direct competition from larger companies with significantly greater financial resources and national brand recognition in 2003 walmart’s online affiliate walmartcom launched an online dvd subscription service walmart dvd rentals likewise blockbuster acquired an online dvd subscription service filmcaddycom in addition blockbuster has announced plans to roll out an online subscription service in late 2004 and then integrate the online and storebased subscription programs sometime in 2005 increased competition may result in reduced operating margins loss of market share and reduced revenues in addition our competitors may form or extend strategic alliances with studios and distributors that could adversely affect our ability to obtain titles on favorable terms 

  

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be affected adversely 

  

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 we anticipate further expanding our operations to help grow our subscriber base and to take advantage of favorable market opportunities any future expansion will likely place significant demands on our managerial operational administrative and financial resources if we are not able to respond effectively to new or increased demands that arise because of our growth or if in responding our management is materially distracted from our current operations our business may be affected adversely in addition if we do not have sufficient breadth and depth of the titles necessary to satisfy increased demand arising from growth in our subscriber base our subscriber satisfaction may be affected adversely 

  

with our additional shipping centers we have seen a decrease in the delivery and return time for dvds to our subscribers in addition we have experienced an increase in the exchange of titles by subscribers the more frequent exchange of titles has increased our shipping and delivery costs and revenue sharing expenses while at 

  

the same time along with other enhancements to our service resulted in improved subscriber retention if the retention rate is not maintained or improved as necessary to offset the costs resulting from any increased usage or if other mitigating factors do not offset such costs our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

we have a limited operating history and may not maintain our level of profitability 

  

although we have achieved profitability in 2003 we are still an early stage company and experienced significant net losses prior to 2003 further given the significant operating and capital expenditures associated with our business plan we may experience net losses in the future in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict due to a number of factors that also will affect our longterm performance 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate in the future based on a variety of factors many of which are outside our control and difficult to predict as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indicator of our future or longterm performance the following factors may affect us from period to period and may affect our longterm performance 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to these factors our operating results may fluctuate based upon seasonal fluctuations in dvd player sales and in the use of the internet during our limited operating history we have experienced greater additions of new subscribers during late fall and the winter months and these seasonal fluctuations may continue in future periods 

  

we face many risks associated with our plans to expand into international markets and may not succeed in our efforts 

  

in 2004 we anticipate expanding our subscription service outside of the united states and we have no experience in doing business internationally it is costly to establish international facilities and operations promote our brand internationally and develop localized web sites we may not succeed in such efforts and achieve our subscriber acquisition or operating goals our revenues from foreign markets may not exceed the costs of establishing and maintaining such operations and therefore these operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis we are subject to risks of doing business internationally including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

one or more of these factors could harm our business operating results and financial condition in addition we will need to devote substantial resources to managing our operations in a foreign environment as a result our managerial operational administrative and financial resources may be strained 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

  

we use complex proprietary software to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations our proprietary technology is intended to allow our nationwide network of shipping centers to be operated on an integrated basis we continually enhance or modify the software used for our distribution operations for example in early 2003 we introduced new software algorithms and procedures designed to enhance local delivery of available dvds to our subscribers and to provide operational efficiencies at our shipping centers we cannot be sure that the enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of dvds among our shipping centers in a timely and efficient manner our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired 

  

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays caused by bioterrorism potential labor activism and inclement weather for example in the fall of 2001 terrorists used the us postal service to deliver envelopes containing anthrax following which mail deliveries around the united states experienced significant delays our dvds are also subject to risks of breakage during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results in addition increased breakage rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

  

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit and marketing expenses 

  

increases in postage delivery rates will adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription fees to offset the increase for example in june 2002 the rate for firstclass postage increased from 034 to 037 which has directly impacted our cost of shipping dvds in addition the us postal service has announced longterm plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the us postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications of our dvd envelopes such changes could result in increased shipping costs for our dvds and our gross margin could be affected adversely also if the us postal service curtails its services such as discontinuing or reducing saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be affected adversely 

  

currently most filmed entertainment is packaged on a single lightweight dvd our delivery process is designed to accommodate the delivery of one dvd to fulfill a selection because of the lightweight nature of a dvd we generally mail one envelope containing a title using standard firstclass postage however studios occasionally provide additional content on a second dvd or may package a title on two dvds if packaging of filmed entertainment on multiple dvds were to become more prevalent or if the weight of dvds were to increase our costs of delivery and fulfillment processing would increase 

  

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation service our business may suffer 

  

based on proprietary algorithms our recommendation service enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandize our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation service to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure you that the proprietary algorithms in our recommendation service will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

  

we are continually refining our recommendation service in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and usefulness to our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing such refinements in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation service 

  

if our recommendation service does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

  

   

   

   

if we do not correctly anticipate our short and longterm needs for titles that we acquire pursuant to revenue sharing agreements our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be affected adversely 

  

under our revenue sharing agreements we generally preorder titles prior to their release on dvd based on our anticipated needs it is generally impracticable for us to acquire additional copy depth for titles while such titles are subject to revenue sharing if we do not acquire sufficient copies of titles we may not satisfy subscriber demand and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be affected adversely conversely if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be affected adversely 

  

if consumer adoption of dvd players slows our business could be adversely affected 

  

the rapid adoption of dvd players has been fueled by strong retail and studio support and falling dvd player prices if retailers or studios reduce their support of the dvd format or if manufacturers raise prices continued dvd adoption by consumers could slow if new or existing technologies were to become more popular at the expense of the adoption or use of dvd technology consumers may delay or avoid purchasing dvd players our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by future consumer adoption of dvd players and if such adoption slows our subscriber growth may also slow 

  

we depend on studios to release titles on dvd for an exclusive time period following theatrical release 

  

our ability to attract and retain subscribers is related to our ability to offer new releases of filmed entertainment on dvds prior to their release to other distribution channels except for theatrical release dvds currently enjoy a significant competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early distribution window for dvds the window for dvd rental and retail sales is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview premium television basic cable and network and syndicated television the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies our business could suffer increased competition if 

  

   

   

the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the title and we cannot assure you that the studios will not change their policies in the future in a manner that would be adverse to our business and results of operations 

  

in addition any conditions that adversely affect the movie industry including constraints on capital financial difficulties regulatory requirements and strikes work stoppages or other disruptions involving writers actors or other essential personnel could adversely affect the availability of new titles consumer demand for filmed entertainment and our business 

  

if we are unable to renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us or if the cost of purchasing titles on a wholesale basis increases our gross margins may be affected adversely 

  

since 2000 we have entered into numerous revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors these revenue sharing agreements generally have terms of up to five years the length of time we share revenue 

  

on each title is a fixed period as our revenue sharing agreements expire we may be required to negotiate new terms that could be disadvantageous to us 

  

during the course of our revenue sharing relationship with studios and distributors various contract administration issues arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios and distributors may be adversely impacted 

  

titles that we do not acquire under a revenue sharing agreement are purchased on a wholesale basis from studios or other distributors if the price of purchased titles increases our gross margin will be affected adversely 

  

if the sales price of dvds to retail consumers decreases our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

the cost of manufacturing dvds is substantially less than the price for which new dvds are generally sold in the retail market thus we believe that studios and other resellers of dvds have significant flexibility in pricing dvds for retail sale if the retail price of dvds decreases significantly consumers may choose to purchase dvds instead of subscribing to our service 

  

if vod or disposable dvds are widely adopted and supported as a method of content delivery by the studios our business could be adversely affected 

  

some digital cable providers and a limited number of internet content providers have implemented technology referred to as vod this technology transmits movies and other entertainment content on demand with interactive capabilities such as start stop and rewind in addition to being available from a small number of cable providers vod has been introduced over the internet as highspeed internet access has greatly increased the speed and quality of viewing content including featurelength movies on personal computers in addition certain companies have developed disposable dvds as currently designed disposable dvds allow a consumer to view a dvd for an unlimited number of times during a given time period following which the dvd becomes unplayable by a chemical reaction and is then disposable if vod or disposable dvds become affordable and viable alternative methods of content delivery widely supported by studios and adopted by consumers our business could be adversely affected 

  

we may need additional capital and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available 

  

historically we have funded our operations and capital expenditures through proceeds from private equity and debt financings equipment leases and cash flow from operations although we currently anticipate that the proceeds from our may 2002 initial public offering together with our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

  

any significant disruption in service on our web site or in our computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers 

  

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site where the title selection process is integrated with our delivery processing systems and software our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our web site network infrastructure and fulfillment processes interruptions in these systems could make our web site unavailable and hinder our ability to fulfill selections much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of our 

  

engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems service interruptions or the unavailability of our web site could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

  

our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our web site service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our general business disruption insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our web site or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our communications hardware and the computer hardware used to operate our web site are hosted at the facilities of a third party provider cable and wireless hardware for our delivery systems is maintained in our shipping centers fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely problems faced by our third party web hosting provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its customers including us could impact adversely the experience of our subscribers in addition any financial difficulties faced by cable and wireless such as its bankruptcy reorganization may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict 

  

our executive offices and our san josebased shipping center are located in the san francisco bay area in the event of an earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster our operations would be affected adversely 

  

our executive offices and our san josebased shipping center which also houses our customer service operations and our excess dvd inventory are located in the san francisco bay area our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of electrical blackouts fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations due to disruptions in service in the san francisco bay area or any other facility because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our san josebased operations center and the surrounding transportation infrastructure we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes 

  

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business and new service developments 

  

we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board barry mccarthy our chief financial officer thomas r dillon our chief operations officer leslie j kilgore our chief marketing officer and neil hunt our chief product officer in addition much of our key technology and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel during the first quarter of 2004 mr mccarthy announced his plans to leave netflix at the end of 2004 the loss of mr mccarthy or other key personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 

  

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data 

  

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendation service we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal 

  

obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

  

to secure transmission of confidential information obtained by us for billing purposes including subscribers’ credit card data we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology in conjunction with the credit card companies we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ credit card and other data if despite these measures we experienced any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers and our business could be affected adversely similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

  

in addition because we obtain subscribers’ billing information on our web site we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even when the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our web site to obtain service and access our dvd inventory typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we do nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

  

our relationship with subscribers and credit card companies could be harmed if our billing software fails 

  

in the past we have experienced problems with our subscriber billing software causing us to overbill subscribers although we have and will continue to credit the accounts of the subscribers we overbill problems with our billing software may have an adverse effect on our subscriber satisfaction and may cause one or more of the major credit companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products in addition if our billing software fails and we fail to bill subscribers our cash flow and results of operations will be affected adversely 

  

increases in credit card processing fees would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our subscribers pay for our subscription services predominately using credit cards from time to time visa mastercard american express and discover may increase the fees that they charge for each transaction using their cards during 2003 our credit card fees totaled 78 million an increase of 60 percent from 2002 the increase was due to an increase in subscription revenues coupled with an increase in the rates charged by the credit card companies we expect some if not all of the credit card companies will further increase their transaction fees in 2004 such increase will adversely affect our results of operations if we elect not to raise our subscription rates to offset the increase 

  

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

  

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright 

  

patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights netflix is a registered trademark of netflix inc we have also filed trademark applications in the united states for the netflixcom and cinematch names and for the netflix design logo and have filed us patent applications for certain aspects of our technology we have also filed trademark applications in certain foreign countries for the netflix name from time to time we expect to file additional trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

  

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site our recommendation service title selection processes and marketing activities 

  

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights if there is any claim against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights and we are unable to obtain sufficient rights or develop noninfringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis our business and competitive position may be affected adversely many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology if we are forced to defend ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor we may face costly litigation diversion of technical and management personnel inability to use our current web site or our recommendation service or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandizing or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

  

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be affected adversely 

  

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could affect adversely our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

  

because our business is accessed over the internet if the internet infrastructure is not developed or maintained we will lose subscribers 

  

the internet may not become a viable commercial marketplace for many potential subscribers due to inadequate development of network infrastructure and enabling technologies that address consumer concerns about 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the internet has experienced a variety of outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and it could face outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could frustrate public use of the internet including use of our web site in addition the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or due to governmental regulation 

  

if we become subject to liability for the internet content that we publish or upload from our users our results of operations would be affected adversely 

  

as a publisher of online content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute 

  

we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and harm our results of operations we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover claims of these types or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed on us 

  

if government regulation of the internet or other areas of our business changes or if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change we may need to change the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses 

  

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

  

the manner in which internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business 

  

in addition if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change consumers may become unwilling to select their entertainment online or otherwise provide us with information necessary for them to become subscribers further we may not be able to effectively market our services online to users of the internet if we 

  

are unable to interact with consumers because of changes in their attitude toward use of the internet our subscriber acquisition and retention may be affected adversely 

  

risks related to our stock ownership 

  

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over netflix 

  

as of december 31 2003 our executive officers and directors their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 38 percent of our outstanding common stock warrants and stock options that are exercisable within 60 days in particular jay hoag one of our directors beneficially owned approximately 27 percent and reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board beneficially owned approximately 11 percent these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from yours and will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

  

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

  

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they 

  

   

   

   

   

   

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 percent or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

  

our stock price is volatile 

  

the price at which our common stock has traded since our may 2002 initial public offering has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

  

in the past securities class action litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities this type of litigation if directed at us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

  

we record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

  

during the second quarter of 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 for stockbased employee compensation in addition during the third quarter of 2003 we began granting stock options to our employees on a monthly basis the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately in comparison with the three to fouryear vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 as a result of immediate vesting stockbased compensation expenses determined under sfas no 123 is fully recognized in the same periods as the monthly stock option grants in addition we continue to amortize the deferred compensation of stock options with three to fouryear vesting periods granted prior to the third quarter of 2003 over the remaining vesting periods our stockbased compensation expenses totaled 63 million 88 million and 107 million during 2001 2002 and 2003 respectively we expect our stockbased compensation expenses will continue to be significant in future periods which will have an adverse impact on our operating results in addition the calculation of our stockbased compensation expenses related to our stock option grants is highly sensitive to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant since our stock price has fluctuated significantly it is difficult to predict our stockbased compensation expenses in future periods 

  

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our financial results will be difficult because of our limited operating history and our actual results may differ from forecasts 

  

as a result of our growth and our limited operating history it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenues gross margin operating expenses number of paying subscribers number of dvds shipped per day and other financial and operating data our inability or the inability of the financial community to accurately forecast our operating results could cause our net income losses in a given quarter to be less greater than expected which could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock we have a limited amount of meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses we base our current and forecasted expense levels and dvd acquisitions on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues which are dependent on the growth of our subscriber base and the demand for titles by our subscribers as a result we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts or to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls in revenues we believe that these difficulties in forecasting are even greater for financial analysts who may publish their own estimates of our financial results 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the value of our investment will decline to minimize this risk we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities our cash equivalents are generally invested in money market funds which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate we intend to limit the percentage invested in shortterm investments to no more than 50 percent of the combined fair value of cash equivalents and shortterm investments in addition we intend to limit the average duration on our shortterm investments to three years or less and maintain an average portfolio credit quality of a or better 

  

as of december 31 2003 our shortterm investments were invested in the vanguard shortterm bond index fun—admiral shares the “fund” the target index for the fund the lehman brothers 15 year governmentcredit index is comprised of us treasury and agency securities and investmentgrade corporate bonds with maturities of one to five years as of december 31 2003 the fund had investments in 517 issues with an average quality of aaaaa1 an average duration of 25 years and an average maturity of 27 years as of december 31 2003 the cost unrealized gain and market value of our shortterm investments were 44701000 596000 and 45297000 respectively 

  

the following table presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of our shortterm investments as a result of changes in interest rates

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms we believe that a control system no matter how well designed and operated cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any can be detected within a company 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2003 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1   business tableend   

we are the largest online entertainment subscription service in the united states providing more than 1000000 subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than 14500 movie television and other filmed entertainment titles our standard subscription plan allows subscribers to have three titles out at the same time with no due dates late fees or shipping charges for 1995 per month subscribers can view as many titles as they want in a month subscribers select titles at our web site wwwnetflixcom aided by our proprietary recommendation service receive them on dvd by firstclass mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers once a title has been returned we mail the next available title in a subscriber’s queue 

  

our subscription service has grown rapidly since its launch in september 1999 we believe our growth has been driven primarily by our unrivalled selection consistently high levels of customer satisfaction rapid consumer adoption of dvd players and our effective marketing programs in the san francisco bay area where we have one or twoday delivery approximately 38 of all households subscribe to netflix 

  

our proprietary recommendation service enables us to create a customized store for each subscriber and to generate personalized recommendations which effectively merchandize our comprehensive library of titles we provide more than 30 million personal recommendations daily in the fourth quarter of 2002 more than 97 of our more than 14500 titles were selected by our subscribers in comparison most entertainment service providers merchandize a narrow selection of box office hits the average large video store carries less than 3000 dvd titles we believe that our recommendation technology based on proprietary algorithms and the more than 230 million movie ratings we have collected from our users enables us to build deep subscriber relationships and maintain a high level of library utilization 

  

we market our service to consumers primarily through payforperformance marketing programs including online promotions advertising insertions with most leading dvd player manufacturers and promotions with electronics and video software retailers these programs encourage consumers to subscribe to our service and include a free trial period of typically 14 days at the end of the trial period subscribers are automatically enrolled as paying subscribers unless they cancel their subscription approximately 90 of trial subscribers become paying subscribers all paying subscribers are billed monthly in advance by credit card 

  

we stock almost every title available on dvd excluding mature and adult content we have established revenue sharing relationships with more than 50 studios and distributors these relationships provide us access to titles on terms attractive to us we also purchase titles directly from studios distributors and independent producers 

  

we ship and receive dvds from numerous shipping centers located throughout the united states we currently are operating 18 shipping centers including our san jose operations and plan to open additional shipping centers in 2003 these centers allow us to provide increasingly faster delivery and return service to our subscribers 

  

  

we are focused on growing our subscriber base and revenues and utilizing our proprietary technology to minimize operating costs our technology is extensively employed to manage and integrate our business including our web site interface order processing fulfillment operations and customer service we believe that our technology also allows us to maximize our library utilization and to run our fulfillment operations in a flexible manner with minimal capital requirements 

  

our service is available nationwide however we continue to evaluate international expansion opportunities and believe that when and if appropriate we will be successful in expanding our operations beyond the united states 

  

industry overview 

  

filmed entertainment is distributed broadly through a variety of channels outofhome channels include movie theaters airlines and hotels inhome distribution channels include home video rental and retail outlets cable and satellite television payperview videoondemand or vod and broadcast television currently studios distribute their filmed entertainment content approximately six months after theatrical release to the home video market seven to nine months after theatrical release to payperview and vod one year after theatrical release to satellite and cable and two to three years after theatrical release to basic cable and syndicated networks however in what may be an emerging trend several of the major studios have recently shortened the release window on certain titles in particular the theatrical to home video window 

  

consumer transition to dvd 

  

the home video segment of the inhome filmed entertainment market has undergone a rapid technology transition away from vhs to dvd at the end of 2002 there were 37 million us television households with a standalone settop dvd player representing 34 of us television households according to adams media research this number does not include other electronic devices such as desktop and laptop computers and video game players many of which are also capable of playing dvds we believe this transition is analogous to the shift in the music industry from audio cassettes to compact discs that resulted in significant additional demand for both new releases and back catalogue inventory similarly we anticipate that the dvd will for all practical purposes replace the vhs cassette and thereafter the dvd will enjoy a similarly long consumer lifetime netflix provides titles to our subscribers on dvd only and has never carried vhs content 

  

challenges faced by consumers in selecting inhome filmed entertainment 

  

the proliferation of new releases available for inhome filmed entertainment and the additional demand for back catalogue titles on dvd create two primary challenges for consumers in selecting titles 

  

first despite the large number of available titles consumers lack a deep selection of titles from existing subscription channels and traditional video rental outlets subscription channels such as hbo and showtime and payperview services currently offer a narrow selection of titles at specified times due to programming schedule constraints and technological issues relating to channel capacity traditional video rental outlets primarily focus on offering new releases and devote limited space to display and stock back catalogue titles 

  

even when consumers have access to the vast number of titles available they generally have limited means to effectively sort through the titles we believe our recommendation service provides our subscribers the tools to select titles within the vast array of options that appeal to their individual preferences 

  

competitive strengths 

  

we believe that our revenue and subscriber growth are a result of the following competitive strengths 

  

   

   

   

   

   

growth strategy 

  

our strategy to provide a premier filmed entertainment subscription service to our large and growing subscriber base includes the following key elements 

  

   

   

   

   

our web site—wwwnetflixcom 

  

we have applied substantial resources to plan develop and maintain proprietary technology to implement the features of our web site such as subscription account signup and management personalized movie merchandising inventory optimization and customer support our software is written in a variety of languages and runs on industry standard platforms 

  

our recommendation service uses proprietary algorithms to compare subscriber movie preferences with preferences of other users contained in our database this technology enables us to provide personalized predictions and movie recommendations unique to each subscriber 

  

we believe our dynamic store software optimizes subscriber satisfaction and the management of our library by integrating the predictions from our recommendation service subscribers’ current queues and viewing histories inventory levels and other factors to determine which movies to merchandise to each subscriber 

  

our proprietary movie search engine indexes our extensive library by title actor and director and sorts them by genre into collections 

  

our account signup and management tools provide a subscriber interface familiar to online shoppers we use a realtime postal address validator to help our subscribers enter correct postal addresses and to determine the additional postal address fields required to assure speedy and accurate delivery we use an online credit card authorization service to help our subscribers avoid typographic errors in their credit card entries these features help prevent fraud and subscriber disappointment resulting from failures to initiate a trial 

  

throughout our web site we have extensive measurement and testing capabilities allowing us to continuously optimize our web site according to our needs as well as those of our subscribers we use random control testing extensively 

  

our web site is run on hardware and software colocated at a service provider offering reliable network connections power air conditioning and other essential infrastructure we manage our web site 24 hours a day seven days a week we utilize a variety of proprietary software freely available tools and commercially supported tools integrated in a system designed to rapidly and precisely diagnose and recover from failures many of our web site systems are redundant including most of the networking hardware and the web servers we conduct upgrades and installations of software in a manner designed to minimize disruptions to our subscribers 

  

we make available on our web site free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing or furnishing those reports to the securities and exchange commission 

  

  

merchandizing 

  

the key to our merchandizing efforts is the personal recommendations generated by our recommendation service all subscribers and site visitors are given many opportunities to rate titles based on the ratings we collect we are able to predict how a particular subscriber will feel about other titles in our library we can also generate “average” ratings for titles 

  

the ratings from our recommendation service also determine which titles are displayed to a subscriber and in which order for example a list of new releases may be ranked by user preference rather than by release date allowing subscribers to quickly find titles they are more likely to enjoy ratings also determine which titles are featured in lead page positions on our web site to increase customer satisfaction and selection activity finally data from our recommendation service is used to generate lists of similar titles which has proven to be a powerful method for catalogue browsing subscribers often start from a familiar title and use our “recommendations” link to find other titles they may enjoy 

  

recommendations are available to anyone who has rated titles on our web site whether or not they are a subscriber by aggregating the ratings of our subscribers and other visitors we have built what we believe to be the world’s largest personal movie ratings database containing more than 230 million ratings 

  

we also provide our subscribers with decision support information about each title in our library this information includes 

  

   

   

   

marketing 

  

we have multiple marketing channels through which we attract subscribers to our service we compensate the majority of our channel partners on a payforperformance basis we believe that our paid marketing efforts are significantly enhanced by the benefits of wordofmouth advertising our subscriber referrals and our active public relations program 

  

online advertising 

  

online advertising is our largest paid source of new subscribers we advertise our service online through paid search listings permission based emails banner ads and text on popular web portals and other web sites in addition we have an affiliate program whereby we make available webbased banner ads and other advertisements that third parties may retrieve on a selfassisted basis from our web site and place on their web sites third parties that place our advertisements and generate online subscriber referrals are generally paid a cash bounty for each subscriber referred to us with no minimum or maximum amounts for which we are liable 

  

other channels 

  

we work with a number of other channels on an opportunistic basis we have agreements with leading dvd player manufacturers requiring them to place inside dvd player boxes a netflix insert that describes our service and offers a free trial we have a relationship with best buy a leading consumer electronics and video retailer which involves a variety of promotional efforts using pointofsale materials stickers on product packaging and other items to promote netflix in its stores and those of its subsidiaries 

  

  

content acquisition 

  

we have entered into revenue sharing arrangements with more than 50 studios and distributors under these agreements we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues for a defined period of time after the revenue sharing period expires for a title the agreements generally grant us the right to acquire for a minimal fee a percentage of the units for retention or sale by us the balance of the units are destroyed or returned to the originating studio the principal terms of each agreement are similar in nature but are generally unique to each studio in addition to revenue sharing agreements we also purchase titles from various studios and distributors and other suppliers on a purchase order basis on a quarterly basis we acquired approximately 60 to 80 of our dvds through our revenue sharing arrangements 

  

fulfillment operations 

  

we currently stock more than 14500 titles on more than 51 million dvds during december 2002 we shipped to and received from subscribers more than 97 million dvds we have applied substantial resources developing maintaining and testing the proprietary technology that helps us manage the fulfillment of individual orders and the integration of our web site transaction processing systems fulfillment operations inventory levels and coordination of our shipping centers 

  

we ship and receive dvds from numerous shipping centers located throughout the united states we currently are operating 18 shipping centers serving the metropolitan areas of atlanta boston dallas denver detroit houston los angeles miami minneapolis new york newark philadelphia phoenix portland san francisco stamford seattle and washington dc we plan to open additional shipping centers in 2003 we estimate the setup cost of a shipping center to be approximately 60000 the capacity of our shipping centers is a function of total square footage configuration and staffing levels 

  

we believe our shipping centers allow us to improve the subscription experience for nonsan francisco bay area subscribers by shortening the transit time for our dvds in the us postal service based on performance standards established by the us postal service for its postal zones we expect to be able to provide oneday delivery service to approximately 60 of the us population by the end of 2003 or approximately 70 of our subscribers currently based on these performance standards we can provide one or twoday delivery service to more than 90 of the us population 

  

customer service 

  

we believe that our ability to establish and maintain longterm relationships with subscribers depends in part on the strength of our customer support and service operations we encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our subscribers in order to continually improve our web site and our service our customer service center is open seven days a week we utilize email to proactively correspond with subscribers we also offer phone support for subscribers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative we focus on eliminating the causes of customer support calls and automating certain selfservice features on our web site such as the ability to report and correct most shipping problems our customer service operations are housed in our san jose california facility 

  

competition 

  

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month 

  

  

video rental outlets and retailers against whom we compete include blockbuster video hollywood entertainment amazoncom walmart and best buy in particular blockbuster continues to test in a number of its locations a storebased subscription model for dvd and game rentals which if released nationally would provide many of the benefits of our business model in a storebased retail environment we believe that we compete with these video rental outlets and movie retailers primarily on the basis of title selection convenience and price we believe that our scalable business model and our subscription service with home delivery and access to our comprehensive library of more than 14500 titles competes favorably against traditional video rental outlets 

  

we also compete against other online dvd subscription services such as walmartcom and filmcaddycom a subsidiary of blockbuster inc subscription entertainment services such as hbo and showtime payperview and vod providers and cable and satellite providers we believe we are able to provide greater subscriber satisfaction due to the broader and deeper selection of titles we are able to offer subscribers our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber based on the subscriber’s selection history personal ratings and the tastes and preferences of similar users through our recommendation service and extensive database of user preferences as well as the ease and speed by which subscribers are able to select receive and return titles 

  

vod has received considerable media attention vod is now widely deployed in most major hotels and has early deployments in many major cable systems within a few years we believe vod will become widely available to digital cable and satellite subscribers vod carries as many titles as can be effectively merchandized on a settop box platform which we believe to be generally up to 100 recent releases plus adult content for consumers who primarily want the latest big releases vod may be a convenient distribution channel we believe that our strategy of developing a large and growing subscriber base and our ability to personalize our library to each subscriber by leveraging our extensive database of user preferences positions us favorably to provide digital distribution of filmed entertainment as that market develops 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2002 we had 381 fulltime employees of these fulltime employees 267 were in fulfillment operations 64 were in technology and development 19 were in marketing and 31 were general or administrative employees we utilize parttime and temporary employees primarily in fulfillment operations to respond to fluctuating demand for dvd shipments we had 114 temporary employees as of december 31 2002 our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

  

intellectual property 

  

we use a combination of trademark copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property we have a registered trademark for the netflix name we have filed applications for several additional trademarks and two patents our outstanding trademark and patent applications may not be allowed even if these applications are allowed they may not provide us a competitive advantage to date we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and knowhow to protect our intellectual property related to our web site and fulfillment processes competitors may successfully challenge the validity and scope of our trademarks 

  

from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property we believe that our service offering does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party however we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 

  

overview 

  

we are the largest online entertainment subscription service in the united states providing more than 1000000 subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than 14500 movie television and other filmed entertainment titles our standard subscription plan allows subscribers to have three titles out at the same time with no due dates late fees or shipping charges for 1995 per month subscribers can view as many titles as they want in a month subscribers select titles at our web site wwwnetflixcom aided by our proprietary recommendation service receive them on dvd by firstclass mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers once a title has been returned we mail the next available title in a subscriber’s queue 

  

we were organized as a delaware corporation in august 1997 we have incurred significant losses since our inception we may continue to incur losses especially if the variable component of our stock based compensation increases as a result of increases in our stock price 

  

on may 29 2002 the company closed the sale of 5500000 shares of common stock and on june 14 2002 the company closed the sale of an additional 825000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering at a price of 1500 per share a total of 94875000 in gross proceeds was raised from these transactions after deducting the underwriting fee of approximately 6641000 and approximately 2060000 of other offering expenses net proceeds were approximately 86174000 upon the closing of the initial public offering all preferred stock was automatically converted into common stock 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 

  

statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

change in estimated life of the cost of our library 

  

in late 2000 and early 2001 we entered into a series of revenue sharing agreements with studios which substantially changed our business model for acquiring dvds and satisfying subscriber demand for titles these revenue sharing agreements enable us to acquire dvds at a lower upfront cost than traditional buying arrangements we share a percentage of the net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with these studios over a fixed period of time generally 12 months before the change in our business model we typically acquired fewer copies of a particular title and utilized each copy over a longer period of time the implementation of these revenue sharing agreements improved our ability to acquire larger quantities of newly released titles and satisfy a substantial portion of subscriber demand for such titles over a shorter period of time on january 1 2001 we revised the amortization policy for the cost of our library from an accelerated method using a threeyear life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a oneyear life 

  

the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and is accounted for on a prospective basis from january 1 2001 had we continued to amortize the dvds acquired prior to january 1 2001 using a threeyear life amortization expense for 2001 would have been 47 million lower than the amount recorded in our financial statements 

  

amortization of upfront costs of our library 

  

under our revenue sharing agreements we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized certain of these payments also include a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is expensed as revenue sharing obligations are incurred the initial fixed license fee is amortized on an accelerated basis over one year we believe the use of an accelerated method is appropriate because we normally experience heavy initial demand for a title which subsides once initial demand has been satisfied 

  

revenues 

  

we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees from the launch of our web site in april 1998 through january 1999 we generated revenues primarily from individual dvd rentals and sales to customers in march 1999 we stopped selling new dvds from february 1999 through october 1999 we generated revenues primarily from individual dvd rentals to customers in september 1999 we launched our subscription service and through february 2000 for a fixed monthly subscription fee of 1595 subscribers could have up to four titles per month with no due dates or late fees and for 398 could order an additional title in february 2000 we modified our standard subscription service to provide subscribers access to an unlimited number of titles for 1995 per month with a maximum of four titles out at any time existing subscribers were switched to our new service some at 1595 per month and the rest at 1995 per month in october 2000 we again modified our standard subscription service to provide subscribers access to an unlimited number of titles for a fixed monthly fee with a maximum of three titles out at the same time there is no minimum subscription period and subscribers can cancel our service at any time 

  

we had no dvd sales in 2000 and insignificant amounts in 2001 and 2002 beginning in late 2000 as part of the change in our business model we began acquiring larger quantities of particular titles through our revenue 

  

sharing agreements as a result once initial demand for a particular title has been satisfied we may hold a number of titles in excess of the quantities needed to satisfy ongoing subscriber demand several studios allow us to sell the dvds acquired from them at the end of the revenue sharing term before we sell a particular title we compare the number of copies we hold to estimated future demand to determine the number of copies we can sell without jeopardizing our ability to satisfy future subscriber demand from time to time we expect to make bulk sales of our used dvds to resellers 

  

we recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscriber’s monthly subscription period we record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues or deferred revenues as appropriate we recognize revenues from the sale of used dvds to resellers when the dvds are shipped to the reseller historically revenues from dvd rentals and shipping revenues also were recognized when the product was shipped to the customer 

  

in addition to our standard service we also offer subscribers other service plans and price points that allow subscribers to keep either fewer or more titles and range in subscription price approximately 90 of our paying subscribers pay 1995 or more per month 

  

cost of revenues 

  

cost of subscription revenues 

  

we acquire titles for our library using traditional buying methods and revenue sharing agreements traditional buying methods normally result in higher upfront costs when compared to titles obtained through revenue sharing agreements cost of subscription revenues consists of revenue sharing costs amortization of our library amortization of intangible assets related to equity instruments issued to certain studios and postage and packaging costs related to shipping titles to paying subscribers 

  

revenue sharing costs  our revenue sharing agreements generally commit us to pay an initial upfront fee for each dvd acquired revenue sharing expense is recorded as dvd’s subject to revenue sharing agreements are shipped to subscribers under certain of our revenue sharing agreements we pay an additional minimum revenue sharing fee for each dvd shipped to a subscriber other than the initial upfront payment for dvd’s acquired we are not obligated to pay any minimum revenue sharing fee on dvds that are not shipped to subscribers we characterize these payments to the studios as revenue sharing costs as of december 31 2002 we had revenue sharing agreements with over 50 studios 

  

amortization of the cost of dvds  on january 1 2001 we revised the estimated life to one year and assumed a salvage value of 200 for the dvds that we believe we will eventually sell prior to january 1 2001 we amortized our cost of dvds using an accelerated method over an estimated life of three years and assumed no salvage value 

  

amortization of intangible assets related to equity issued to studios  in 2000 in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with columbia tristar home entertainment dreamworks international distribution and warner home video we agreed to issue each of these studios an amount of our series f nonvoting preferred stock equal to 1204 of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding in 2001 in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with twentieth century fox home entertainment and universal studios home video we agreed to issue to each of the two studios an amount of our series f nonvoting preferred stock equal to 1204 of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding as of december 31 2001 the aggregate of series f nonvoting preferred stock granted to these five studios equaled 602 of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding our obligation to maintain the studios’ equity interests at 602 of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding terminated immediately prior to our initial public offering the studios’ series f preferred stock automatically converted into 1596415 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering we measured the original issuances and any subsequent adjustments using the fair value of the securities at the issuance and any subsequent adjustment dates the fair value was recorded as an intangible asset 

  

and is amortized to cost of subscription revenues ratably over the remaining term of the agreements which initial terms were either three or five years 

  

postage and packaging  postage and packaging costs consist of the postage costs to mail titles to and from our paying subscribers each of which was 034 through june 29 2002 and increased to 037 on june 30 2002 and the packaging and label costs for the mailers 

  

cost of sales revenues 

  

cost of revenues for dvd sales includes the salvage value for used dvds sold and historically cost of merchandise sold to customers 

  

operating expenses 

  

fulfillment 

  

fulfillment expense represents those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our distribution and customer service centers including costs attributable to receiving inspecting and warehousing our library 

  

fulfillment expense also includes credit card fees and other collection related expenses through december 2001 we maintained only one distribution center in san jose california as of december 31 2002 we were operating from 13 shipping centers located throughout the united states including our san jose operations during 2003 we anticipate opening between 10 to 15 additional shipping centers to continue to reduce delivery times and increase library utilization 

  

technology and development 

  

technology and development expense consists of payroll and related expenses we incur related to testing maintaining and modifying our web site our recommendation service telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internaluse software systems technology and development expense also includes depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our web site and store our data we continuously research and test a variety of potential improvements to our internal hardware and software systems in an effort to improve our productivity and enhance our subscribers’ experience we expect to continue to invest in technology and improvements in our web site and internaluse software and as a result we expect our technology and development expense will continue to increase we have capitalized technology and development related expenses of 13 million in 2000 12 million in 2001 and 12 million in 2002 the capitalized amounts are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated period of benefit of each improvement generally one year 

  

marketing 

  

marketing expense consists of marketing expenditures and other promotional activities including revenue sharing costs postage and packaging costs and library amortization costs related to free trial periods in the second half of 2001 we implemented several new subscriber acquisition activities which provide incentives in the form of payforperformance payments for each new subscriber provided to us we anticipate that our marketing expense will increase in future periods as a result of the overall growth in our subscriber base free trial offers and payforperformance arrangements 

  

general and administrative 

  

general and administrative expense consists of payroll and related expenses for executive finance content acquisition and administrative personnel as well as recruiting professional fees and other general corporate expenses 

  

  

stockbased compensation 

  

stockbased compensation for equity instruments issued to employees represents the aggregate difference at the grant date between the respective exercise price of stock options or stock grants and the fair market value of the underlying stock less forfeitures stockbased compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options or grants based on an accelerated amortization method 

  

in 2001 we offered our employees and directors the right to exchange certain stock options we exchanged options to purchase approximately 900000 shares of common stock with varying exercise prices in exchange for options to purchase approximately 900000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of 300 as of december 31 2002 approximately 635000 of these options were outstanding the stock option exchange resulted in variable award accounting treatment for all of the exchanged options variable award accounting will continue until all options subject to variable accounting are exercised cancelled or expire variable accounting treatment will result in unpredictable and potentially significant charges or credits to our operating expenses from fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 

  

for each hypothetical onedollar increase or decrease in the fair value of our common stock we will record deferred compensation in an amount equal to the number of shares underlying the variable awards multiplied by the onedollar change however to the extent these variable awards are not fully vested our stock compensation expense will be less than the amount we record as deferred compensation for example if at december 31 2002 the fair value of our common stock had increased or decreased by 100 our deferred stockbased compensation would change by approximately 06 million and our stockbased compensation expense would be affected by approximately 03 million once these variable awards become fully vested our stock based compensation will be affected on a dollarfordollar basis and a change in our stock price will directly impact the amount we record as stockbased compensation in an amount equal to the number of shares underlying the variable awards outstanding multiplied by the change in the fair value of our common stock for example assuming all 635000 exchanged options are fully vested and outstanding and assuming an increase or decrease in the fair value of our common stock of 100 in a quarter our stockbased compensation expense or credit related to the variable awards for that quarter would be 06 million as of december 31 2002 most of these variable awards were not fully vested and had a variety of final vesting dates over the next two years 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the periods presented certain data from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues the information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

   

year ended december 31 2001 compared to year ended december 31 2002 

  

revenues 

  

subscription revenues  our subscription revenues increased from 743 million in 2001 to 1508 million in 2002 representing a 103 increase this increase was driven primarily by a 103 increase in the average number of subscribers between 2001 and 2002 we believe the increase in the number of subscribers was caused by our unrivalled selection of titles consistently high levels of subscriber satisfaction the rapid consumer adoption of dvd players and our increasingly effective marketing programs 

  

cost of revenues and gross profit 

  

cost of subscription revenues  cost of subscription revenues increased by 279 million from 491 million in 2001 to 770 million in 2002 representing a 57 increase this increase was attributable primarily to a 117 increase in the number of dvds mailed to our subscribers which was driven by a 104 increase in average paying subscribers our dvd amortization costs decreased by 42 million representing a 21 decrease the decrease was attributable primarily to a 47 million increase in amortization in 2001 which was caused by the change in the estimated life of our dvd library from three years to one year effective january 1 2001 partially offset by an increase in amortization related to increased acquisitions for our library our revenue sharing costs increased by 168 million representing a 132 increase this increase was due 

  

primarily to a modest increase in the percentage of titles subject to revenue sharing agreements mailed to our subscribers our postage and packaging costs increased by 145 million representing a 99 increase our postage rate per title in 2002 was lower than 2001 notwithstanding the rate for firstclass postage increasing to 037 from 034 on june 30 2002 this postage rate per title decrease was attributable primarily to a full year benefit of reduced postage per title as a result of packaging improvements completed during the second quarter of 2001 our amortization of intangible assets increased by 08 million representing a 43 increase the increase in amortization was attributable to increases in intangible assets caused by our obligation to issue additional shares to these studios upon dilution which ceased immediately prior to our initial public offering 

  

gross profit  our gross profit increased from 260 million in 2001 to 747 million in 2002 representing 343 and 489 of revenues respectively our gross profit percentages increased primarily as a result of the growth in our subscription revenues and a decrease in our direct incremental costs of providing those subscription services coupled with the 21 reduction in dvd amortization costs in 2002 as compared to 2001 

  

operating expenses 

  

fulfillment  fulfillment expenses increased from 135 million in 2001 to 194 million in 2002 representing a 44 increase this increase was attributable primarily to an increase in the overall volume of the activities of our fulfillment operations and an increase in credit card fees from 32 million in 2001 to 49 million in 2002 as a percentage of revenues fulfillment expense decreased from 177 in 2001 to 127 in 2002 due primarily to a combination of an increasing revenue base and substantial improvements in our fulfillment productivity due to our continuous efforts to refine and streamline our fulfillment operations and a reduction in credit cards fees as a percentage of revenues from 42 in 2001 to 32 in 2002 the rate of improvement in our fulfillment productivity may decrease in future periods as we reach diminishing marginal returns on the refinements and streamlining efforts to our operations credit card fees increased due to an increase in subscription revenues 

  

technology and development  technology and development expenses decreased from 177 million in 2001 to 146 million in 2002 representing an 18 decrease this decrease was caused primarily by decreases in personnel costs as a result of employees terminated as part of our restructuring in 2001 as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses decreased from 234 in 2001 to 96 in 2002 due primarily to an increase in revenues and a decrease in the absolute dollar amount we spent on technology and development 

  

marketing  our marketing expenses increased from 210 million in 2001 to 358 million in 2001 representing a 70 increase this increase was attributable primarily to a 101 increase in the number of new trial subscribers in 2002 compared to 2001 partially offset by decreases in the marketing cost per acquired subscriber from 3716 to 3139 the decrease in the cost per acquired subscriber was due primarily to costs related to free trials and marketing staff and other costs increasing only moderately in absolute dollars but declining 16 on a per acquired subscriber basis due to the large increase in new trial subscribers as a percentage of revenues marketing expenses decreased from 277 in 2001 to 234 in 2002 due primarily to an increase in revenues 

  

general and administrative  our general and administrative expenses increased from 47 million in 2001 to 67 million in 2002 representing a 45 increase this increase was attributable primarily to an increase in the number of personnel to support our increasing subscriber base as well as increased directors and officers insurance and property insurance costs and additional professional fees caused by public company filing requirements as a percentage of revenues general and administrative expenses decreased from 61 in 2001 to 44 in 2002 due primarily to an increase in revenues 

  

stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation expense increased from 57 million consisting of 53 million related to fixed awards and 04 million related to variable awards in 2001 to 98 million consisting of 78 million related to fixed awards and 20 million related to variable awards in 2002 

  

  

the increase in the fixed award compensation expense was attributable to the issuance of options in 2002 prior to our initial public offering with exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock since our initial public offering there is no longer any difference between fair market value and the exercise price for new option grants and as a result no new deferred stockbased compensation has or is expected to arise from new awards consequently we expect our future stockbased compensation expense will relate to existing awards 

  

the increase in stockbased compensation expense related to variable awards was due to a full year of vesting for the variable awards repriced in august of 2001 as compared to a partial year of vesting in 2001 partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of our common stock during 2002 

  

interest and other income expense net 

  

interest and other expense net increased substantially from 14 million in 2001 to 103 million in 2002 this increase was attributable primarily to a onetime noncash charge of 107 million associated with our early repayment triggered by the consummation of our initial public offering in may 2002 of all outstanding indebtedness under our subordinated promissory notes related to the acceleration of the accretion of the unamortized discount 

  

year ended december 31 2000 compared to year ended december 31 2001 

  

revenues 

  

subscription revenues  our subscription revenues increased from 359 million in 2000 to 743 million in 2001 representing a 107 increase this increase was driven primarily by an 88 increase in the average number of subscribers between 2000 and 2001 we believe the increase in the number of subscribers was caused by our unrivalled selection of titles consistently high levels of subscriber satisfaction the rapid consumer adoption of dvd players and our increasingly effective marketing programs in addition part of the increase was due to a 400 increase in the monthly subscription fee charged to some of our subscribers beginning in october 2000 

  

cost of revenues and gross profit 

  

cost of subscription revenues cost of subscription revenues increased by 242 million from 249 million in 2000 to 491 million in 2001 representing a 97 increase this increase was attributable primarily to 82 increase in the number of dvds mailed to our subscribers which was driven by a 94 increase in average paying subscribers our revenue sharing costs increased by 114 million representing a 816 increase this increase was due primarily to a substantial increase in the percentage of titles subject to revenue sharing agreements mailed to our subscribers our dvd amortization costs increased by 81 million representing a 70 increase this increase was attributable primarily to the decrease in the period over which we amortize the cost of our library our postage and packaging costs increased by 33 million representing a 29 increase this increase was attributable primarily to an increase in the number of dvds mailed to our subscribers partially offset by a decrease in the postage rate per title as a result of packaging improvements our amortization of intangible assets increased by 14 million representing a 321 increase this increase was attributable to a full year of amortization in 2001 as compared to a partial year of amortization in 2000 additional deferred charges for two new revenue sharing agreements in 2001 and increases in deferred charges caused by our obligation to issue additional equity securities to these studios 

  

gross profit  our gross profit increased from 110 million in 2000 to 260 million in 2001 representing a 136 increase and gross profit percentages of 31 in 2000 and 34 in 2001 our gross profit percentages increased primarily as a result of the growth in our subscription revenues and a decrease in our direct incremental costs of providing those subscription services 

  

  

operating expenses 

  

fulfillment  fulfillment expenses increased from 102 million in 2000 to 135 million in 2001 representing a 31 increase this increase was primarily attributable to increases in the overall volume of the activities of our primary fulfillment center and an increase in credit card fees from 16 million in 2000 to 32 million in 2001 as a percentage of revenues fulfillment expenses decreased from 29 in 2000 to 18 in 2001 primarily due to a combination of an increasing revenue base and improvements in our fulfillment productivity due to our continuous efforts to refine and streamline our fulfillment operations credit card fees increased due to an increase in subscription revenues 

  

technology and development  excluding capitalized software development costs our technology and development expenses increased from 168 million in 2000 to 177 million in 2001 representing a 5 increase this increase was primarily the result of our investment in storing data handling large increases in traffic on our web site and maintaining and modifying our software related to our web site our recommendation service and our internalsoftware infrastructure as a percentage of revenues technology and development expenses decreased from 47 in 2000 to 23 in 2001 primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues 

  

marketing  our marketing expenses decreased from 257 million in 2000 to 210 million in 2001 representing an 18 decrease this decrease was primarily attributable to scaling back the number of free trial offers for part of 2001 and a reduction in our free trial offer period of 30 days to typically 14 days for the balance of 2001 as a percentage of revenues marketing expenses decreased from 72 in 2000 to 28 in 2001 primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues 

  

general and administrative  our general and administrative expenses decreased from 70 million in 2000 to 47 million in 2001 representing a 33 decrease this decrease was primarily attributable to our cost containment efforts in 2001 and the 13 million onetime cost of our withdrawn public offering in 2000 as a percentage of revenues general and administrative expenses decreased from 20 in 2000 to 6 in 2001 primarily due to an increase in subscription revenues 

  

restructuring  in 2001 we recorded a restructuring expense of 07 million relating to severance payments made to 45 employees we terminated in an effort to restructure our organization to streamline our processes and reduce expenses we had no restructuring expense in prior years 

  

stockbased compensation our stockbased compensation expenses decreased from 88 million in 2000 to 57 million in 2001 representing a 35 decrease this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced charges caused by utilization of the graded vesting method of stock compensation amortization and fewer options issued at exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock 

  

interest and other income expense net 

  

we had interest and other income net of 02 million in 2000 and interest and other expense net of 14 million in 2001 the change between 2000 and 2001 was attributable primarily to a decrease in interest income caused by a decrease in our interest bearing cash balances and additional interest charges caused by the issuance of subordinated notes payable with a face amount of 130 million 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

since inception we have financed our activities primarily through a series of private placements of convertible preferred stock subordinated promissory notes and our initial public offering as of december 31 2002 we had cash and cash equivalents of 598 million and shortterm investments of 438 million although we currently anticipate that the proceeds from our may 2002 public offering together with our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend among other things on our development 

  

efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution see “risks related to our business” and “risks related to our ownership” 

  

net cash used in operating activities was 227 million in 2000 net cash provided by operating activities was 48 million in 2001 and 401 million in 2002 net cash used in operating activities in 2000 was primarily attributable to a net loss of 574 million and an increase in prepaid and other current assets partially offset by deferred compensation expense depreciation and amortization expense noncash interest expenses increases in accounts payable accrued expenses and deferred revenue net cash provided by operating activities in 2001 was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue a decrease in operating expenses and an increase in accounts payable net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was attributable primarily to a 167 million reduction in net loss due to revenues growing at a much faster rate than operating expenses offset by a 33 million reduction in depreciation and amortization a 41 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation a 104 million increase in noncash interest expense and a 93 million increase in operating assets and liabilities offset by a 17 million gain on disposal of used dvds 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 250 million in 2000 127 million in 2001 and 673 million in 2002 net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was primarily attributable to our acquisition of titles for our library and property and equipment partially offset by proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments net cash used in investing activities in 2001 was primarily attributable to our acquisition of titles for our library and property and equipment the 63 decrease in cash used to acquire dvds in 2001 from 2000 primarily reflects the reduced cash requirements to acquire dvds under our revenue sharing agreements net cash used in investing activities in 2002 was attributable primarily to a 430 million purchase of shortterm investments with a portion of our initial public offering proceeds and 241 million related to the acquisition of titles for our dvd library while dvd acquisition expenditures are classified as cash flows from investing activities you may wish to consider these together with cash flows from operating activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 484 million in 2000 91 million in 2001 and 709 million in 2002 net cash provided by financing activities in 2000 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of our series e convertible preferred stock partially offset by payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of common stock warrants and subordinated promissory notes partially offset by payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations net cash provided by financing activities in 2002 was attributable primarily to proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering that raised net proceeds of 862 million partially offset by the repayment of 142 million on our subordinated notes payable and 29 million on our other notes payable and capital lease obligations 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as december 31 2002 we have lease obligations under noncancelable operating leases and capital leases with various expiration dates through march 2005 future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital leases as of december 31 2002 are as follows in thousands 

  

   

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2001 financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas no 143 requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets that result from acquisition construction development andor normal use of the assets we also will record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation we are required to adopt sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 the adoption of sfas no 143 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for exit or disposal activities  sfas 146 addresses significant issues regarding the recognition measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance of emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  sfas 146 will be effective in 2003 the adoption of sfas 146 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results 

  

in november 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on issue 0216 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor addressing the accounting of cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor including vendor rebates and refunds the consensus reached states that consideration received should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products or services and should therefore be shown as a reduction of cost of sales in the income statement of the customer the presumption could be overcome if the vendor receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration or the consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by the customer in selling the vendor’s product or service if one of these conditions is met the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of those costs in the income statement of the customer the consensus reached also concludes that if rebates or refunds can be reasonably estimated such rebates or refunds should be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration to be received relative to the transactions that mark the progress of the customer toward earning the rebate or refund the provisions of this consensus are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or operating results 

  

in november 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on issue 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  addressing how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria 1 the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis 2 there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items and 3 delivery of any undelivered item is probable arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 with early adoption permitted the provisions of this consensus are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or operating results 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 34  this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize at inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken this initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 

  

2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51  this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 for public enterprises such as us with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before february 1 2003 the interpretation is applied to the enterprise no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june 15 2003 the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january 31 2003 if it is reasonably possible that we will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective 

  

factors that may affect future results of operations 

  

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 

  

risks related to our business 

  

if our efforts to attract subscribers are not successful our revenues will be affected adversely 

  

we must continue to attract and retain subscribers to succeed we must continue to attract a large number of subscribers who have traditionally used video retailers video rental outlets pay cable channels such as hbo and showtime and payperview and videoondemand or vod for inhome filmed entertainment our ability to attract and retain subscribers will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our subscribers a high quality experience for selecting viewing receiving and returning titles including providing accurate recommendations through our recommendation service if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of high quality or if we introduce new services that are not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers in addition many of our new subscribers originate from wordofmouth advertising and referrals from existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful we may not be able to attract new subscribers and as a result our revenues will be affected adversely 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations and the failure of this technology to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

  

we use complex proprietary software to process deliveries and returns of our dvds and to manage other aspects of our operations our proprietary technology is intended to allow our shipping centers throughout the united states to be operated on an integrated basis we continually enhance or otherwise modify the software used for our distribution operations for example in early 2003 we introduced new software algorithms and procedures designed to enhance local delivery of available dvds to our subscribers and to otherwise provide operational efficiencies at our shipping centers we cannot be sure that the enhancements or other modifications we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our subscribers if we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage the processing of dvds among our shipping centers in a timely and efficient manner our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired 

  

if we are not able to manage our growth our business could be affected adversely 

  

we have expanded rapidly since we launched our web site in april 1998 we anticipate further expanding our operations to help grow our subscriber base and to take advantage of favorable market opportunities any 

  

future expansion will likely place significant demands on our managerial operational administrative and financial resources if we are not able to respond effectively to new or increased demands that arise because of our growth or if in responding our management is materially distracted from our current operations our business may be affected adversely in addition if we do not have sufficient breadth and depth of the titles necessary to satisfy increased demand arising from growth in our subscriber base our subscriber satisfaction may be affected adversely 

  

in 2002 we opened approximately 12 shipping centers throughout the united states we currently plan to open approximately 10 to 15 additional shipping centers in 2003 although we have a limited history in operating our shipping centers we have seen a decrease in the delivery and return time for dvds to those subscribers serviced by the shipping centers in addition we have experienced an increase in the exchange of titles by subscribers in those areas the more frequent exchange of titles has increased our shipping and delivery costs and revenue sharing expenses while at the same time along with other enhancements to our service resulted in improved subscriber retention if the improved retention is not maintained or improved as necessary to offset the costs resulting from any increased usage or if other mitigating factors do not offset such costs our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

we have no experience offering our subscription service outside the united states if we offer our service outside the united states we will need to focus substantial resources to handling operations in a foreign environment including addressing issues related to foreign labor markets and the regulatory environments as a result our managerial operational administrative and financial resources may be strained any international expansion may not achieve the subscriber acquisition or operating results anticipated by us at the time we determine to expand our operations internationally 

  

if we experience excessive rates of subscriber churn our revenues and business will be harmed 

  

we must minimize the rate of loss of existing subscribers while adding new subscribers subscribers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently delivery takes too long the service is a poor value and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved we must continually add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel and to continue to grow our business beyond our current subscriber base if too many of our subscribers cancel our service or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers sufficient to grow our business our operating results will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers cancel our service we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

  

we have a limited operating history and history of net losses and we may experience net losses in the future 

  

you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in their early stage of development we have experienced significant net losses since our inception and given the significant operating and capital expenditures associated with our business plan we may experience net losses in the future we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve profitability if we do achieve profitability we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase such profitability we incurred net losses of 219 million for the year ended 2002 

  

our operating results are expected to be difficult to predict based on a number of factors that also will affect our longterm performance 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate in the future based on a variety of factors many of which are outside our control and difficult to predict as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may 

  

not be a good indicator of our future or longterm performance the following factors may affect us from periodtoperiod and may affect our longterm performance 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to these factors our operating results may fluctuate based upon seasonal fluctuations in dvd player sales and in the use of the internet during our limited operating history we have experienced greater additions of new subscribers during late fall and the winter months and these seasonal fluctuations may continue in future periods 

  

if our efforts to build strong brand identity and improve subscriber satisfaction and loyalty are not successful we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results will be affected adversely 

  

the netflix brand is young and we must continue to build strong brand identity to succeed we must continue to attract and retain a large number of owners of dvd players who have traditionally relied on storebased rental outlets and persuade them to subscribe to our service through our web site we may be required to incur significantly higher advertising and promotional expenditures than we currently anticipate to attract large numbers of new subscribers we believe that the importance of brand loyalty will increase with a proliferation of dvd subscription services and other means of distributing titles such as vod if our branding efforts are not successful our operating results and our ability to attract and retain subscribers will be affected adversely 

  

  

if we experience delivery problems or if our subscribers or potential subscribers lose confidence in the us mail system we could lose subscribers which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

we rely exclusively on the us postal service to deliver dvds from our shipping centers and to return dvds to us from our subscribers we are subject to risks associated with using the public mail system to meet our shipping needs including delays caused by bioterrorism potential labor activism and inclement weather for example in the fall of 2001 terrorists used the us postal service to deliver envelopes containing anthrax following which mail deliveries around the united states experienced significant delays our dvds also are subject to risks of breakage during delivery and handling by the us postal service the risk of breakage is also impacted by the materials and methods used to replicate our dvds if the entities replicating our dvds use materials and methods more likely to break during delivery and handling or we otherwise fail to timely deliver dvds to our subscribers our subscribers could become dissatisfied and cancel our service which could adversely affect our operating results and increased breakage rates for our dvds will increase our cost of acquiring titles 

  

increases in the cost of delivering dvds could adversely affect our gross profit and marketing expenses 

  

increases in postage delivery rates will adversely affect our gross profit if we elect not to raise our subscription rates to offset the increase for example in june 2002 the rate for firstclass postage increased from 034 to 037 which increase will directly impact our cost of shipping dvds in addition the us postal service has announced longterm plans to reduce its costs and make its service more efficient if the postal service were to change any policies relative to the requirements of firstclass mail including changes in size weight or machinability qualifications such changes could result in increased shipping costs for our dvds and our gross profit could be affected adversely also if the us postal service curtails its services such as by the discontinuation of saturday delivery service our ability to timely deliver dvds could diminish and our subscriber satisfaction could be affected adversely 

  

currently most filmed entertainment is packaged on a single lightweight dvd our delivery process is designed to accommodate the delivery of one dvd to fulfill a selection because of the lightweight nature of a dvd we generally mail one envelope containing a title using standard firstclass postage however studios occasionally provide additional content on a second dvd or may package a title on two dvds if packaging of filmed entertainment on multiple dvds were to become more prevalent or if the weight of dvds were to increase our costs of delivery and fulfillment processing would increase in addition we expense shipping costs of free trial programs to new subscribers as marketing expense therefore if the cost of delivering titles were to increase our marketing expense would be adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to effectively utilize our recommendation service our business may suffer 

  

based on proprietary algorithms our recommendation service enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandize our library to our subscribers we believe that in order for our recommendation service to function most effectively it must access a large database of user ratings we cannot assure you that the proprietary algorithms in our recommendation service will continue to function effectively to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles 

  

we are continually refining our recommendation service in an effort to improve its predictive accuracy and therefore its usefulness to our subscribers we may experience difficulties in implementing such refinements for example in the fourth quarter of 2002 we did not launch a new version of our recommendation service due to implementation difficulties while we did launch the new version in the first quarter of 2003 we cannot assure you that we will be will be able to continue to make and implement meaningful refinements to our recommendation service 

  

  

if our recommendation service does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy or if we are unable to implement meaningful improvements our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful in which event 

  

   

   

   

if we do not correctly anticipate our short and longterm needs for titles that we acquire pursuant to revenue sharing agreements our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations may be affected adversely 

  

under our revenue sharing agreements we generally preorder titles prior to their release on dvd based on our anticipated needs if we anticipate inaccurately and we acquire insufficient copy depth for specific titles it is generally impracticable for us to acquire additional copy depth for such titles while such titles are subject to revenue sharing if we do not acquire sufficient copies of titles we may not satisfy subscriber demand and our subscriber satisfaction and results of operations could be affected adversely conversely if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand then our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be affected adversely 

  

if our subscribers select titles that are more expensive for us to acquire and deliver on a more frequent basis our expenses would increase 

  

certain titles cost us more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they are acquired and the terms on which they are acquired if subscribers select these more costly titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected our revenue sharing and other dvd acquisition expenses could increase and our gross margins could be adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to offset increased demand for titles with increased subscriber retention or operating margins our operating results may be affected adversely 

  

subscribers to our service can view as many titles as they want every month and depending on the service plan may have out between two and eight titles at a time currently we operate 18 shipping centers and plan to open additional centers in 2003 with our use of these shipping centers and the associated software and procedural upgrades there has been a reduction in the transit time of dvds as a result our subscribers have been able to exchange more titles per month which has increased our operating costs as we rollout additional shipping centers or further refine our distribution process we may see an increase in usage by our subscribers if our subscriber retention does not increase or our operating margins do not improve to an extent necessary to offset the effect of increased operating costs our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

in addition subscriber demand for titles may increase for a variety of other reasons beyond our control including promotion by studios and seasonal variations in movie watching our subscriber growth and retention may be affected adversely if we attempt to increase our monthly subscription fees to offset any increased costs of acquiring or delivering titles 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be affected adversely 

  

the market for inhome filmed entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple inhome filmed entertainment providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another for example consumers may subscribe to hbo rent a dvd 

  

from blockbuster buy a dvd from walmart and subscribe to netflix or some combination thereof all in the same month competitors may be able to launch new businesses at relatively low cost dvds represent only one of many existing and potential new technologies for viewing filmed entertainment in addition the growth in adoption of dvd technology is not mutually exclusive from the growth of other technologies if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors and technologies we may not be able to achieve adequate market share increase our revenues or achieve and maintain profitability our principal competitors include or could include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

many of our competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial marketing and other resources than we do some of our competitors have adopted and may continue to adopt aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and web site and systems development than we do the rapid growth of our online entertainment subscription business since our inception may attract direct competition from larger companies with significantly greater financial resources and national brand recognition in october of 2002 walmart’s online affiliate walmartcom announced that it was testing an online dvd subscription service walmart dvd rentals and that based on the result of such test would likely rollout a service nationwide in 2003 likewise blockbuster recently acquired an online dvd subscription service filmcaddycom blockbuster is also testing instore dvd rental subscription programs increased competition may result in reduced operating margins loss of market share and reduced revenues in addition our competitors may form or extend strategic alliances with studios and distributors that could affect adversely our ability to obtain filmed entertainment on favorable terms 

  

if consumer adoption of dvd players slows our business could be adversely affected 

  

the rapid adoption of dvd players has been fueled by strong retail support strong studio support and falling dvd player prices if retailers or studios reduce their support of the dvd format or if manufacturers raise prices continued dvd adoption by consumers could slow if new or existing technologies such as dvhs were to become more popular at the expense of the adoption or use of dvd technology consumers may delay or avoid purchasing a dvd player our subscriber growth will be substantially influenced by future consumer adoption of dvd players and if such adoption slows our subscriber growth may also slow 

  

we depend on studios to release titles on dvd for an exclusive time period following theatrical release 

  

our ability to attract and retain subscribers is related to our ability to offer new releases of filmed entertainment on dvd prior to their release to other distribution channels except for theatrical release dvd and vhs currently enjoy a significant competitive advantage over other distribution channels such as payperview and vod because of the early timing of the distribution window for dvd and vhs the window for dvd and vhs rental and retail sales is generally exclusive against other forms of nontheatrical movie distribution such as payperview premium television basic cable and network and syndicated television the length of the exclusive window for movie rental and retail sales varies typically ranging from 30 to 90 days 

  

  

our business could suffer increased competition if 

  

   

   

the order length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the title and we cannot assure you that the studios will not change their policies in the future in a manner that would be adverse to our business and results of operations 

  

in addition any conditions that adversely affect the movie industry including constraints on capital financial difficulties regulatory requirements and strikes work stoppages or other disruptions involving writers actors or other essential personnel could affect adversely the availability of new titles consumer demand for filmed entertainment and our business 

  

if we are unable to renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us or if the cost to us of purchasing titles on a wholesale basis increases our gross margins may be affected adversely 

  

since 2000 we have entered into over 50 revenue sharing arrangements with studios and distributors these revenue sharing agreements generally have terms of up to five years the length of time we share revenue on each title ends after a fixed period as our revenue sharing agreements expire we may be required to negotiate new terms that could be disadvantageous to us 

  

during the course of our revenue sharing relationship with studios and distributors various contract administration issues arise to the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner our relationship with the studios may be adversely impacted 

  

titles that we do not acquire under a revenue sharing agreement are purchased on a wholesale basis from studios or other distributors if the price of titles that we purchase wholesale increases our gross margin will be affected adversely 

  

if the sales price of dvds to retail consumers decreases our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

the cost of manufacturing dvds is substantially less than the price for which new dvds are generally sold in the retail market thus we believe that studios and other resellers of dvds have significant flexibility in pricing dvds for retail sale if the retail price of dvds were to become significantly lower consumers may choose to purchase dvds rather than subscribe to our service 

  

if disposable dvds are adopted and supported as a method of content delivery by the studios our business could be adversely affected 

  

certain companies have developed disposable dvds as currently designed disposable dvds allow a consumer to view a dvd for an unlimited number of times during a given time period following which the dvd becomes unplayable by a chemical reaction and is then disposable for example in november of 2002 scenes from the newly release james bond film die another day were distributed to members of the media in a promotion of the movie the discs were rendered unplayable 36 hours after being exposed to the air if disposable dvds become a viable alternative method of content delivery supported by the studios our business could be adversely affected 

  

  

if we fail to maintain or adequately replace our outside sources of new subscribers or are unable to continue to market our service in the manner currently conducted our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our marketing expenses may increase 

  

we obtain a large portion of our new subscribers through incentivebased online marketing programs we engage third parties to solicit new subscribers through the use of banner ads popunder placements direct links and emails we also have an active affiliate program by which third parties register with us and obtain particular advertisements from us for use on their web sites or through other online marketing forums in addition we have engaged in various offline incentivebased marketing programs for example we obtain subscribers through solicitations placed inside the packaging of stand alone dvd players through arrangements we have with dvd player manufacturers we have also explored other incentivebased advertising channels including newspaper and television advertising these third parties may not continue to participate in our marketing programs if the programs do not provide sufficient value for their participation our competitors offer better terms or the market for incentivebased advertising decreases if we are unable to maintain or replace these sources of subscribers our subscriber levels may be affected adversely and our cost of marketing may increase 

  

in addition while the dvd player manufacturers with whom we have promotional relationships are required to include our promotional materials with every dvd player they sell we cannot effectively control what portion of dvd players sold by them actually include the promotional materials if these dvd player manufacturers do not fully comply with the terms of our promotional relationships our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely in addition as these agreements expire we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these arrangements on terms acceptable to us 

  

if we are unable to continue our current marketing activities our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

we may not be able to continue to support the marketing of our service by email or other online means if such activities are adverse to our business laws or regulations may be enacted which prohibit use of emails or similar marketing activities even if no relevant law or regulation is enacted we may discontinue use or support of these activities if we become concerned that subscribers or potential subscribers deem them intrusive or they otherwise adversely affect our goodwill and brand for example we recently terminated our relationship with certain email marketers who did not meet our email marketing standards which include that all recipients have given permission to receive email solicitations directly from the marketer if these marketing activities are curtailed our ability to attract new subscribers may be affected adversely 

  

we may need additional capital and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available 

  

historically we have funded our operating losses and capital expenditures through proceeds from private equity and debt financings equipment leases and cash flow from operations although we currently anticipate that the proceeds from our may 2002 public offering together with our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future we may require additional financing our ability to obtain financing will depend among other things on our development efforts business plans operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 

  

any significant disruption in service on our web site or in our computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers 

  

subscribers and potential subscribers access our service through our web site where the title selection process is integrated with our delivery processing systems and software our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our subscribers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our web site network 

  

infrastructure and fulfillment processes interruptions in these systems could make our web site unavailable and hinder our ability to fulfill selections much of our software is proprietary and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our software and computer systems service interruptions or the unavailability of our web site could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential subscribers 

  

our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations and loss misuse or theft of data our web site periodically experiences directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service any attempts by hackers to disrupt our web site service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation our general business disruption insurance does not cover expenses related to direct attacks on our web site or internal systems efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our web site or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our communications hardware and the computer hardware used to operate our web site are hosted at the facilities of a third party provider hardware for our delivery systems is maintained in our shipping centers fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins and similar events could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely problems faced by our third party web hosting provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems by which it allocates capacity among its subscribers including us could impact adversely the experience of our subscribers any of these problems could result in a loss of subscribers 

  

our executive offices and san josebased shipping center are located in the san francisco bay area in the event of an earthquake other natural or manmade disaster or power loss our operations would be affected adversely 

  

our executive offices and san josebased distribution center which houses our customer service operations and our excess dvd inventory are located in the san francisco bay area our business and operations could be materially adversely affected in the event of electrical blackouts fires floods earthquakes power losses telecommunications failures breakins or similar events we may not be able to effectively shift our fulfillment and delivery operations due to disruptions in service in the san francisco bay area or any other facility because the san francisco bay area is located in an earthquakesensitive area we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to or total destruction of our primary distribution center and the surrounding transportation infrastructure we are not insured against any losses or expenses that arise from a disruption to our business due to earthquakes further the state of california has experienced deficiencies in its power supply over the last few years resulting in occasional rolling blackouts if rolling blackouts or other disruptions in power occur our business and operations would be disrupted and our business would be affected adversely 

  

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could seriously harm our existing business and new service developments 

  

we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including reed hastings our chief executive officer president and chairman of the board barry mccarthy our chief financial officer and secretary thomas r dillon our vice president of operations leslie j kilgore our vice president of marketing and neil hunt our vice president of ecommerce in addition much of our key technology and systems are custom made for our business by our personnel so that the loss of our key technology personnel could disrupt the operation of our title selection and fulfillment systems and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and expand our systems 

  

  

privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data 

  

in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with providing our personal movie recommendation service we collect and utilize data supplied by our subscribers we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits increased regulation of data utilization practices including selfregulation as well as increased enforcement of existing laws could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation and relationships with subscribers would be harmed if our billing data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons 

  

to secure transmission of confidential information obtained by us for billing purposes including subscribers’ credit card data we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology in conjunction with the credit card companies we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ credit card and other data if despite these measures we experienced any unauthorized intrusion into our subscribers’ data current and potential subscribers may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become subscribers and our business could be affected adversely similarly if a wellpublicized breach of the consumer data security of any other major consumer web site were to occur there could be a general public loss of confidence in the use of the internet for commerce transactions which could adversely affect our business 

  

in addition because we obtain subscribers’ billing information on our web site we do not obtain signatures from subscribers in connection with the use of credit cards by them under current credit card practices to the extent we do not obtain cardholders’ signatures we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions even where the associated financial institution approves payment of the orders from time to time fraudulent credit cards are used on our site to obtain service and access our discs typically these credit cards have not been registered as stolen and are therefore not rejected by our automatic authorization safeguards while we do have a number of other safeguards in place we do nonetheless experience some loss from these fraudulent transactions we do not currently carry insurance against the risk of fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our business and results of operations 

  

our relationship with subscribers and credit card companies could be harmed if our billing software fails 

  

we have in the past experienced problems with our subscriber billing software causing us to overbill subscribers although we have and will continue to credit the accounts of the subscribers we overbill problems with our billing software may have an adverse effect on our subscriber satisfaction and may cause one or more of the major credit companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products in addition if our billing software fails and we fail to bill subscribers our cash flow and results of operations will be affected adversely 

  

if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

  

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary rights netflix is a registered trademark of netflix inc we have also filed trademark applications in the united states for the netflixcom and cinematch names and for the netflix design logo and have filed us patent applications for aspects of our technology we have also filed trademark applications in certain foreign countries for the netflix name from time to time we expect to file additional trademark and patent applications nevertheless these applications may not be approved third parties may challenge any patents issued to or held by us third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents trademarks and other proprietary rights and we may not be able to prevent infringement 

  

without substantial expense to us if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected 

  

intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to among other things our web site our recommendation service title selection processes and marketing activities 

  

trademark copyright patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies our intellectual property rights extend to our technology business processes and the content on our web site we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights from time to time third parties allege our violation of intellectual property rights if there is any claim against us for infringement misappropriation misuse or other violation of third party intellectual property rights and we are unable to obtain sufficient rights or develop noninfringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices as appropriate on a timely basis our business and competitive position may be affected adversely many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet we have not exhaustively searched patents relative to our technology if we are forced to defend ourselves against intellectual property claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor we may face costly litigation diversion of technical and management personnel inability to use our current web site or our recommendation service or inability to market our service or merchandise our products as a result of a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology enter into royalty or licensing agreements adjust our merchandizing or marketing activities or take other action to resolve the claims these actions if required may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us costly or unavailable 

  

if we are unable to protect our domain names our reputation and brand could be affected adversely 

  

we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand including netflixcom failure to protect our domain names could affect adversely our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees the regulation of domain names in the united states may change in the near future governing bodies may establish additional toplevel domains appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names as a result we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names furthermore the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 

  

because our business is accessed over the internet if the internet infrastructure is not developed or maintained we will lose subscribers 

  

the internet may not become a viable commercial marketplace for many potential subscribers due to inadequate development of network infrastructure and enabling technologies that address consumer concerns about 

  

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

the internet has experienced a variety of outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and it could face outages and delays in the future these outages and delays could frustrate public use of the internet including use of our web site offerings in addition the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or due to governmental regulation 

  

if we become subject to liability for the internet content that we publish or upload from our users our results of operations would be affected adversely 

  

as a publisher of online content we face potential liability for negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute 

  

we also may face potential liability for content uploaded from our users in connection with our communityrelated content or movie reviews if we become liable then our business may suffer litigation to defend these claims could be costly and harm our results of operations we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover claims of these types or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed on us 

  

we may need to change the manner in which we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses if government regulation of the internet or other areas of our business changes or if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change 

  

the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business in addition the growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws which may impose additional burdens on us if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model 

  

the manner in which internet and other legislation may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined and may subject either us or our customers to potential liability which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet could decrease the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business 

  

in addition if consumer attitudes toward use of the internet change consumers may become unwilling to select their entertainment online or otherwise provide us with information necessary for them to become subscribers further we may not be able to effectively market our services online to users of the internet if we are unable to interact with consumers because of changes in their attitude toward use of the internet our subscriber acquisition and retention and operating results may be affected adversely 

  

risks related to our stock ownership 

  

our officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over netflix 

  

our executive officers and directors their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds as of march 12 2003 beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 55 of our common stock in particular 

  

jay hoag one of our directors beneficially owns approximately 34 of our common stock and reed hastings our president chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns approximately 13 of our common stock and michael schuh one of our directors beneficially owns approximately 12 of our common stock these stockholders may have individual interests that are different from yours and will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

  

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

  

our charter documents may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they will 

  

   

   

   

   

   

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

  

our stock price is volatile 

  

the price at which our common stock has traded since our initial public offering in may of 2002 has fluctuated significantly the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price 

  

in the past securities class action litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities this type of litigation if directed at us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources 

  

  

we will record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

  

we are required to recognize as a reduction of stockholders’ equity deferred compensation equal to the difference between the fair market value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant this deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options generally three to four years using the graded vesting method at december 31 2002 approximately 114 million of deferred compensation related to employee stock options remained unamortized the resulting amortization expense will have a material negative impact on our operating results in future periods in addition in august and september 2001 we repriced options to purchase an aggregate of 913795 shares of our common stock to 300 per share we cannot predict the amount of compensation expense that we will have to recognize on a quarterly basis for these repriced options and it could materially negatively impact our operating results for future periods 

  

financial forecasting by us and financial analysts who may publish estimates of our financial results will be difficult because of our limited operating history and our actual results may differ from forecasts 

  

as a result of our growth and our limited operating history it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenues gross profit operating expenses number of paying subscribers number of dvds shipped per day and other financial and operating data the inability by us or the financial community to accurately forecast our operating results could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected which could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock we have a limited amount of meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses we base our current and forecasted expense levels and dvd acquisitions on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues which are dependent on the growth of our subscriber base and the demand for titles by our subscribers as a result we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts or to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls in revenues we believe that these difficulties in forecasting are even greater for financial analysts that may publish their own estimates of our financial results
